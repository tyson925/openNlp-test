        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830</TIMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Darwin</ENAMEX>'s investigation of the
        Galapagos finches led to an appreciation of the structural
        characteristics that varied and were conserved among the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> in this landmark comparative study. His analysis of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">finches</ENAMEX>' structural features was the foundation for his
        theory on the origin and evolution of biological species [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . Today, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 years later</TIMEX>, our understanding of cells
        from a molecular perspective, in parallel with the
        technological advances in nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequencing</ENAMEX> and
        computer hardware and software, affords us the opportunity
        to determine and study the sequences for many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from a
        comparative perspective, followed by the computational
        analysis, cataloging, and presentation of the resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wide Web</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970</TIMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> revisited <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX>
        evolution from a molecular sequence and structure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>. Their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primary objectives were to determine
        phylogenetic relationships for all organisms, including
        those that can only be observed with a microscope, using a
        single molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chronometer</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> (rRNA), and
        to predict the correct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA molecule</ENAMEX>, given
        that the number of possible structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can be larger
        than the number of elemental particles in the universe. For
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> objective, they rationalized that the origin of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and the related issue of the phylogenetic
        relationships for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are encoded in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX>'s rRNA, a molecule that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">encompasses two-thirds</NUMEX> of
        the mass of the bacterial ribosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
        comprise the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and most
        significant findings was the discovery of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> kingdom
        of life, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaebacteria</ENAMEX> (later renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX>
        ] . Subsequently, the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> produced
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, based on the analysis of a
        single molecule, that included prokaryotes, protozoa,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . These accomplishments
        were the foundation for the subsequent revolution in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rRNA</ENAMEX>-based phylogenetic analysis, which has resulted in the
        sequencing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16S</NUMEX>-like rRNA and
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 23S</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23S</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rRNA genes</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> trying
        to resolve the phylogenetic relationships for organisms
        that occupy different sections of the big phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
        The prediction of tRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with a comparative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>'s [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] and subsequent
        validation with tRNA crystal structures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ]
        established the foundation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>'s
        to begin predicting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5S</TIMEX> rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> from the analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sequences</ENAMEX>. They realized that all sequences within
        the same functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA class</ENAMEX> (in this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>) will
        form the same secondary and tertiary structure. Thus, for
        all of the possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> secondary and tertiary structures
        for any one <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequence</ENAMEX>, such as for 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli 5S rRNA</ENAMEX>, the correct
        structure for this sequence will be similar to the correct
        secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for every other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5S</NUMEX> rRNA sequence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] .
        While the first complete <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA sequence was
        determined for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">covariation</ENAMEX>-based structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were not predicted until
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rRNA sequences were determined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first 23S</NUMEX> rRNA sequence was determined for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ; the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">covariation</ENAMEX>-based structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were predicted the
        following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, once a few more complete <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23S</NUMEX> rRNA sequences
        were determined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Both of these comparative
        structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were improved as the number of sequences
        with different patterns of variation increased and the
        covariation algorithms were able to resolve different types
        and extents of covariation (see below). Initially, the
        alignments of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA sequences were analyzed for
        the occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C, A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> base pairs that occur
        within potential helices in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 22</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] rRNAs. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> rRNA covariation-based structure
        models have undergone numerous revisions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] . Today, with a significantly larger number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and more advanced covariation algorithms, we
        search for all positional covariations, regardless of the
        types of pairings and the proximity of those pairings with
        other paired and unpaired nucleotides. The net result is a
        highly refined secondary and tertiary covariation-based
        structure model for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA. While the majority of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models contain standard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C, A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>
        base-pairings arranged into regular secondary structure
        helices, there were many novel base-pairing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> ( 
        e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U <-> C</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>; A:A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"><-> G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G; G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> <-> A:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> ) and base pairs that form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tertiary</ENAMEX> or tertiary-like structural elements. Thus, the
        comparative analysis of the rRNA sequences and structures
        has resulted in the prediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and the
        identification of structural motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Beyond the comparative structure analysis of the three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribosomal RNAs</ENAMEX> and transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> have
        been studied with this perspective. These include the group
        I [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase P</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">telomerase RNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] , tmRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
        ] , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRP RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . The comparative sequence
        analysis paradigm has been successful in determining
        structure over this wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules.
        Very recently, the authenticities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX>
        comparative structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have been determined [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutell</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in preparation]:
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97-98%</NUMEX> of the secondary and tertiary structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs
        predicted with covariation analysis are present in the
        crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">30S</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">50S</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal subunits</ENAMEX>. Thus, the underlying premise for
        comparative analysis and our implementation of this method,
        including the algorithms, the sequence alignments, and the
        large collection of comparative structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with
        different structural variations for each of the different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules ( 
        e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNAs</ENAMEX>) have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">validated</ENAMEX>.
        The highly refined and accurate analysis of phylogenetic
        relationships and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with comparative analysis
        can require very large, phylogenetically and structurally
        diverse data sets that contain raw and analyzed data that
        is organized for further analysis and interpretation. With
        these requirements for our own analysis, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of
        this comparative information for the greater scientific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, we have been assembling, organizing, analyzing,
        and disseminating this comparative information. Initially,
        a limited amount of sequence and comparative structure
        information was available online for our 16S (and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16S</NUMEX>-like)
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23S</TIMEX> (and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23S</NUMEX>-like) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNAs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52</NUMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In parallel, two
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have been providing various forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequence</ENAMEX> and structure data (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RDP/RDP II</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53 54</NUMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5S/5.8</NUMEX>S [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] , small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57</NUMEX> ] and

        increases in the amount of sequences available for the RNAs
        under study here, improved programs for the analysis of
        this data, and better web presentation software, we have

            collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models was predicted with
            covariation analysis, as described at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Site</ENAMEX>
            Methods Section
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/METHODS/</ENAMEX>and in several
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> (see below).
            Briefly, covariation analysis, a specific
            application of comparative analysis (as mentioned
            earlier), searches for helices and base pairs that are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in different sequences that form the same
            functionally equivalent molecule ( 
            e.g., tRNA sequences). It was
            determined very early in this methodology that the
            correct helix is the one that contains positions within
            a potential helix that vary in composition while
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maintaining G</ENAMEX>:C, A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> base pairs. As more
            sequences for a given molecule were determined, we
            developed newer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algorithms</ENAMEX> that searched for positions
            in an alignment of homologous sequences that had
            similar patterns of variation. This latter
            implementation of the covariation analysis helped us
            refine the secondary and tertiary structure models by
            eliminating previously proposed base pairs that are not
            underscored with positional covariation and identifying
            new secondary and tertiary structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs that do
            have positional covariation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 70 71 72</NUMEX> ] . Our
            newest covariation analysis methods associate
            color-coded confidence ratings with each proposed base
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pair</ENAMEX> (see reference structure diagrams and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2A</ENAMEX>,
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nucleotide Frequency Tabular Display</ENAMEX>," for more
            details). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> exception to this is the tRNA analysis,
            which was initially performed with the Mixy
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX> ] , and thus the color
            codes are based on that analysis.
            When implemented properly, covariation analysis can
            predict <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with extreme accuracy. All of the
            secondary structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs and a few of the
            tertiary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure base</ENAMEX> pairs predicted with
            covariation analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 71 72 73 74</NUMEX> ] are
            present in the tRNA crystal structure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The
            analysis of fragments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5S rRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] resulted in similar levels of success.
            Most recently, the high-resolution crystal structures
            for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 30S</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">50S</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> subunits
            have given us the opportunity to evaluate our rRNA
            structure models. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 97-98%</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> and
            23S rRNA base pairs predicted with covariation analysis
            are in these crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (Gutell 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in
            preparation). This congruency between the comparative
            model and the crystal structure validates the
            comparative approach, the covariation algorithms, the
            accuracy of the juxtapositions of sequences in the
            alignments, and the accuracy of all of the comparative
            structure models presented herein and available at the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Site</ENAMEX>. However, while nearly all of the base pairs
            predicted with comparative analysis are present in the
            crystal structure solution, some interactions in the
            crystal structure, which are mostly tertiary
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, do not have similar patterns of variation
            at the positions that interact (Gutell 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in
            preparation). Thus, covariation analysis is unable to
            predict many of the tertiary base pairings in the
            crystal structure, although it does identify nearly all
            of the secondary structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base pairings</ENAMEX>.
            Beyond the base pairs predicted with covariation
            analysis, comparative analysis has been used to predict
            some structural motifs that are conserved in structure

            Nucleotide: The standard format for

            (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2C</ENAMEX>) reveals our confidence for
            each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base pair</ENAMEX>, as predicted by covariation analysis.
            Base pairs with a red identifier ("-" for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C and A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>
            base pairs, small closed circles for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, large open

            base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>) have the greatest amount of covariation;
            thus, we have the most confidence in these predicted
            base pairs. Base pairs with a green, black, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grey</ENAMEX>, or
            blue identifier have progressively lower covariation
            scores and are predicted due to the high percentages of
            A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U + G</ENAMEX>:C and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> at these positions. The most

            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, named "bpseq," is a simple text format that
            contains the sequence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nucleotide per line, its

            Tentative: In addition to the 16S
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> rRNA structure models, we have also identified
            some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNAs that have a
            lower, although significant, extent of covariation.
            These are considered 'tentative' and are shown on
            separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA secondary structure diagrams
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/CSI/2STR/.</ENAMEX> These base
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> and base triples have fewer coordinated changes
            (or positional covariations) and/or a higher number of
            sequences that do not have the same pattern of
            variation present at the other paired position.
            Consequently, we have less confidence in these putative
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, in contrast with the interactions
            predicted in our main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models.
            The 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helix Numbering</ENAMEX> secondary structure
            diagrams illustrate our system for uniquely and
            unambiguously numbering each helix in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA molecule</ENAMEX>.
            Based upon the numbering of the reference sequence,
            each helix is named for the position number at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
            end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the helix. For example, the first
            16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> helix, which spans 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> positions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9-13/21</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>, is
            named "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>;" the helix at positions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">939-943/1340</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1344</TIMEX> is
            named "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">939</NUMEX>." This numbering system is used in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nucleotide Frequency Tabular Display</ENAMEX> tables (see
            below). The 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schematic</ENAMEX> versions of the reference
            structure diagrams replace the nucleotides with a line
            traversing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA backbone</ENAMEX>.

            the global arrangement of the base pairs. For the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histogram</ENAMEX> version (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>), the sequence is
            displayed as a line from left (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>') to right (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>'), with
            the secondary structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs shown in blue above
            the sequence line; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below</NUMEX> this line, tertiary structure
            base pairs and base triples are shown in red and green,
            respectively. The distance from the baseline to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> line is proportional to the distance
            between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> interacting positions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            sequence. In contrast, in the circular diagram, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is drawn clockwise (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>') in a circle,
            starting at the top. Secondary and tertiary base-base
            interactions are shown with lines traversing the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>, using the same coloring scheme as in the
            histogram diagram. The global arrangement and
            higher-order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the base pairs predicted
            with covariation analysis are revealed in part in these
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative formats. The majority of the base pairs
            are clustered into regular secondary structure helices,
            and the majority of the helices are contained within
            the boundaries of another helix, forming large
            cooperative sets of nested helices. The remaining base
            pairs form tertiary interactions that either span two
            sets of nested helices, forming a pseudoknot, or are
            involved in base triple interactions.

            present comparative structure model are shown above
            this line. The number of potential helices is larger
            than the actual number present in the
            biologically-active <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Methods</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae phenylalanine tRNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, with a length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> nucleotides, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
            possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helices</ENAMEX> (as defined above); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> of these
            are in the crystal structure. The

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> (nt), has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 15,000</NUMEX> possible helices;
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 60</NUMEX> of these are in the crystal structure.
            For the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli 23S rRNA</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2904</TIMEX> nt), there
            are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50,000</NUMEX> possible helices, with
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX> in the crystal structure. The number
            of possible secondary structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is significantly
            larger than the number of possible helices, due to the
            exponential increase in the number of different

            1B. Evolution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA comparative
            structure models
            An analysis of the evolution of the
            Noller-Woese-Gutell comparative structure models for
            the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNAs</ENAMEX> is presented here
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/CSI/EVOLUTION/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-1B.1</ENAMEX>).
            Our objective is to categorize the improvements in
            these covariation-based comparative structure models by
            tabulating the presence or absence of every proposed
            base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in each version of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA
            structure models, starting with our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first 16S</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
            and 23S [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA models</ENAMEX>. Every base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in each of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models was evaluated against the growing
            number and diversity of new rRNA sequences. Proposed
            base pairs were taken out of the structure model when
            the number of sequences without either a covariation or
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C, A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was greater than our
            allowed minimum threshold; the nucleotide frequencies
            for those base pairs are available from the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lousy</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base-Pair</ENAMEX>" tables that are discussed in the next
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>. New <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs were proposed when a (new)
            significant covariation was identified with our newer
            and more sensitive algorithms that were applied to
            larger sequence alignments containing more inherent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Methods</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/METHODS/</ENAMEX>for more
            detail).
            Although other comparative structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and base
            pairs were predicted by other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX>, those interactions
            are not included in this analysis of the improvements
            in our structure models. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models
            for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> are very similar to one another.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brimacombe</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 20</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strasburg</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 21</NUMEX> ]
            structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were determined independently of ours,
            while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Wachter</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 79</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were adapted from
            our earlier structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and have incorporated some
            of the newer interactions proposed here.
            This analysis produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very large tables with
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">579</NUMEX> proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rRNA base</ENAMEX> pairs evaluated against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
            versions of the structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1001</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23S</NUMEX> rRNA base
            pairs evaluated against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> versions of the structure
            model. Some highlights from these detailed tables are
            captured in summary tables (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 3aand 3b</ENAMEX>, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/CSI/EVOLUTION/</ENAMEX>) that
            compare the numbers of sequences and base pairs
            predicted correctly and incorrectly for each of the
            major versions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA structure
            models. For this analysis, the current structure model
            is considered to be the correct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>; thus, values
            for comparisons are referenced to the numbers of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and base pairs in the current structure model
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">478</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 7000</TIMEX> sequences for
            16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">870</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 1050</TIMEX>
            sequences for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23S</TIMEX> rRNA). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> sets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA
            secondary structure diagrams were developed to reveal
            the improvements between the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and earlier
            versions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) changes since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1996</TIMEX> published structure
            models; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) changes since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>) or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> (23S
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) all previously proposed base pairs that
            are not in the most current structure models
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-1B.2</ENAMEX>).
            An analysis of these tables reveals several major
            conclusions from the evolution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">covariation</ENAMEX>-based structure models. First,
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 80%</NUMEX> of the 23S
            rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs predicted in the initial structure
            models appear in the current structure models. The
            accuracy of these early models, produced from the
            analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two well</NUMEX>-chosen sequences, is
            remarkable. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the accuracy, number of secondary
            and tertiary structure interactions, and complexity of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models increase as the number and
            diversity of sequences increase and the covariation
            algorithms are improved. As well, some pairs predicted
            in the earlier structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were removed from
            subsequent models due to the large number of exceptions
            to the positional covariation at the two paired
            positions. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the majority of the tertiary
            interactions were proposed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last few</TIMEX> versions of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models.
          
          
            1C. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> structure definitions
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> models presented here are composed
            of several different basic building blocks (or motifs)
            that are described and illustrated at our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> Structure
            Definitions page
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/CSI/DEFS/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-1C.1-2</ENAMEX>). The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in a comparative structure model can be
            either base paired or unpaired. Base paired nucleotides
            can be part of either a secondary structure helix (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more consecutive</TIMEX>, antiparallel and nested base
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs</ENAMEX>) or a tertiary interaction, which is a more
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heterogeneous</ENAMEX> collection of base pair interactions.
            These include any non-canonical base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C,
            A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>; 
            e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>), lone or single base
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> (when both positions in a base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> are not
            flanked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nucleotides that are base paired to one
            another), base pairs in a pseudoknot arrangement, and
            base triples (a single nucleotide interacting with a
            base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>). Each of these base pair categories has a
            unique color code in the illustrations on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Structure Definitions</ENAMEX>" page, which provides multiple
            examples of each category from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA
            structure models. In contrast to the nucleotides that
            are base paired, nucleotides can also be unpaired in
            the comparative structure models. Within this category,
            they can be within a hairpin loop (nucleotides capping
            the end of a helix), internal loop (nucleotides within
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> helices), or in a multi-stem loop (nucleotides
            within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or more helices</TIMEX>).

            2A. Nucleotide frequency tabular display
            The nucleotide frequency tables appear in two
            general presentation modes. In the traditional table,
            the nucleotide types are displayed in the columns,
            while their frequencies are shown for each alignment in
            the rows. The nucleotide frequencies were determined
            for single positions, base pairs, and base triples for
            a subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Site</ENAMEX> collection
            (detailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Single nucleotide frequencies
            are available for all individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>, based upon
            the reference sequence, for every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in this
            collection. Base pair frequencies are presented for a)
            all base pairs in the current covariation-based
            structure models, b) tentative base pairs predicted
            with covariation analysis, and c) base pairs previously
            proposed with comparative analysis that are not
            included in our current structure models due to a lack
            of comparative support from the analysis with our best
            covariation methods on our current alignments (named
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lousy</ENAMEX>" base pairs). Base triples are interactions
            between a base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> unpaired nucleotide;
            base triple frequencies are provided for a) base
            triples in the current covariation-based structure
            models and b) tentative base triples predicted with
            covariation analysis.
            For each of these frequency tables, the percentages
            of each of the nucleotides are determined for multiple
            alignments, where the most similar sequences are
            organized into the same alignment. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three rRNAs</TIMEX>,
            the alignments are partitioned by their phylogenetic
            relationships. There is an alignment for the
            nuclear-encoded rRNA for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary
            lines of descent ((<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archaea</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eucarya</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> ] ), each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eucarya</ENAMEX> organelles
            (no alignments yet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5S</TIMEX> rRNA; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) Chloroplasts
            and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) Mitochondria), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> larger alignments that
            include all of the (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) nuclear-encoded rRNA sequences
            for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eucarya</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) these
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Eucarya
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organelles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
            For the tRNA and group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> intron sequences,
            the most similar sequences are not necessarily from
            similar phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Instead, the sequences
            that are most similar with one another are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
            the same functional and/or structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. The tRNA
            sequences are grouped according to the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that
            are bound to the tRNA. Currently, only the type I tRNAs
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX> ] are included here; the tRNAs are collected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>
            functional subgroup alignments and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> total type I
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX>. The group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> intron alignments are
            based on the structural classifications determined by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suh</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> ] ). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I introns are split into
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> alignments: A, B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cl-2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX>, D, E, and unknown.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II introns are divided into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subgroups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
            For the standard nucleotide frequency tables
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Highlight 2A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX>)), the left frame in the main frame
            window (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"List Frame"</ENAMEX>) contains the position numbers for
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of tables: single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>, base pairs,
            and base triples. Clicking on a position, base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, or
            base triple number will bring the detailed nucleotide
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrence</ENAMEX> and frequency information to the main window
            ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Data Frame;</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A.1</ENAMEX>). The collective scoring data
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A.2</ENAMEX>) used to predict the base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is obtained,
            where available, by clicking the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Collective Score</ENAMEX>"
            link on the right-hand side of the base pair frequency
            table.
            As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1A</ENAMEX>, we have established a
            confidence rating for the base pairs predicted with the
            covariation analysis; a detailed explanation of the
            covariation analysis methods and the confidence rating
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> will be available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CRW Site http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rna</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icmb</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utexas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/METHODS/.</ENAMEX> The
            extent of base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair types</ENAMEX> and their mutual exchange
            pattern ( 
            e.g., A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U <-> G</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>) is
            indicative of the covariation score. This value
            increases to the maximum score as the percentage and
            the amount of pure covariations (simultaneous changes
            at both positions) increase in parallel with a decrease
            in the number of single uncompensated changes, and the
            number of times these coordinated variations occur
            during the evolution of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (for the rRNAs, the
            number of times this covariation occurs in the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>) increases. These scores are
            proportional to our confidence in the accuracy of the
            predicted base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. Red, our highest confidence
            rating, denotes base pairs with the highest scores and
            with at least a few phylogenetic events (changes at
            both paired positions during the evolution of that base
            pair). The colors green, black, and grey denote base
            pairs with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C, A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>, and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 80%</NUMEX> of
            the sequences and within a potential helix that
            contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> red base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. Base pairs with a
            green confidence rating have a good covariation score
            although not as high as (or with the confidence of) a
            red base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs have a lower
            covariation score, while grey base pairs are invariant,
            or nearly so, in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> of the sequences. Finally, blue
            base pairs do not satisfy these constraints;
            nevertheless, we are confident of their authenticity
            due to a significant number of covariations within the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in a subset of the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> or are
            an invariant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> or A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> pairings in close proximity to
            the end of a helix.
            The covariation score for each base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is
            determined independently for each alignment ( 
            e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Domain/Two Organelle</ENAMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Domain, Archaea</ENAMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> ). The collective score for
            each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base pair</ENAMEX> is equivalent to the highest ranking
            score for any one of the alignments. For example, we
            have assigned our highest confidence rating to the
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">927:</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1390</TIMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rRNA (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2C; H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). Note
            that the entry for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">927</NUMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1390</TIMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX>) in the
            list of base pairs in the left frame is red in the C
            (or confidence) column. For this base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, only the T
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Phylogenetic</ENAMEX> Domains/<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organelle</ENAMEX>) alignment
            has a significant covariation score (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX>); thus, only
            the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">T</ENAMEX>" alignment name is red. Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 6000</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> alignment, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX> of the sequences have
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.2%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>:A at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9%</NUMEX>,
            and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> of the sequences have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>:C, C:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>,

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A.2</ENAMEX>) reveals that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> phylogenetic events
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> alignment, while the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C1</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C3</NUMEX> score is
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX>, greater than the minimum value for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and
            this alignment (a more complete explanation of the

            diagrams
            Conservation secondary structure diagrams summarize
            nucleotide frequency data by revealing the nucleotides
            present at the most conserved positions and the
            positions that are present in nearly all sequences in
            the analyzed data set. The conservation information is
            overlaid on a secondary structure diagram from a
            sequence that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> ( 
            e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subdivision of the Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>, or

            hidden from view, and replaced by arcs. These regions
            are labeled to show the minimum and maximum numbers of

            Insertions relative to the reference sequence are
            identified with a blue line to the nucleotides between
            which the insertion occurs, and text in small blue font
            denoting the maximum number of nucleotides that are
            inserted and the percentage of the sequences with any
            length insertion at that place in the conservation
            secondary structure diagram (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2C.1</ENAMEX>). All insertions
            greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> are tabulated, in
            addition to insertions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides that

            Structure-based alignments and phylogenetic
            analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> structure
            Analysis of the patterns of sequence conservation
            and variation present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequence alignments</ENAMEX> can
            reveal phylogenetic relationships and be utilized to
            predict <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. The accuracy of the phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is directly
            dependent on the proper juxtapositioning of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the alignment. These alignments are an
            attempt to approximate the best juxtapositioning of
            sequences that represent similar placement of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in their three-dimensional structure. For
            sequences that are very similar, the proper
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juxtapositioning</ENAMEX> or alignment of sequences can be
            achieved simply by aligning the obviously similar or
            identical subsequences with one another. However, when
            there is a significant amount of variation between the
            sequences, it is not possible to align sequences
            accurately or with confidence based on sequence
            information alone. For these situations, we can
            juxtapose those sequences that form the same secondary
            and tertiary structure by aligning the positions that
            form the same components of the similar structure
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> ( 
            e.g., align the positions that
            form the base of the helix, the hairpin loop, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> ). Given the accurate
            prediction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNA secondary structures
            from the analysis of the alignments we assembled, we
            are now even more confident in the accuracy of the
            positioning of the sequence positions in our
            alignments, and the process we utilize to build
            them.
          
          
            Aligning new sequences
            At this stage in our development of the sequence
            alignments, there are well-established and distinct
            patterns of sequence conservation and variation. From
            the base of the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, we observe regions
            that are conserved in all of the rRNA sequences that
            span the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phylogenetic domains and the two
            eucaryotic organelles, the chloroplast and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the rRNA are conserved
            within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phylogenetic domains although variable
            in the mitochondria. As we proceed into the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, we observe positions that are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and different
            at the same level in the other phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For
            example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bacterial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNAs</ENAMEX> have positions that are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> within all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but
            different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> and the Eucarya
            (nuclear-encoded). These types of patterns of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> and variation transcend all levels of the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and result in features in the rRNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that are characteristic for
            each of the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at each level of the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> ( 
            e.g., level one: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacterial</ENAMEX>,

            of evolution at the positions in the rRNA to the hands
            on a clock [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The highly variable regions are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hand; these can change many
            times for each single change that occurs in the regions
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the minute hand. Accordingly, the
            minute hand regions change many times for each single
            change in the hour hand regions of the rRNAs. In
            addition to the different rates of evolution, many of
            the positions in the rRNA are dependent on one another.
            The simplest of the dependencies, positional
            covariation, is the basis for the prediction of the
            same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> from similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX> (see
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section</ENAMEX> 1A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covariation Analysis</ENAMEX>).
            We utilize these underlying dynamics in the
            evolution and positional dependency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> to
            facilitate the alignment and structural analysis of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX>. Our current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> data sets contain a very
            large and diverse set of sequences that represent all
            sections of the major phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> on the tree
            of life. This data collection also contains many
            structural variations, in addition to their conserved
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structure core. The majority of the new
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX> are very similar to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> sequence
            that has already been aligned for maximum sequence and
            structure similarity; thus, these sequences are
            relatively simple to align. However, some of the new
            sequences contain subsequences that cannot be aligned
            with any of the previously aligned sequences, due to
            the excessive variation in these hypervariable regions.
            For these sequences, the majority of the sequence can
            be readily aligned with the more conserved elements,
            followed by a manual, visual analysis of the
            hypervariable regions. To align these hypervariable
            regions with more confidence, we usually need several
            more sequences with significant similarity in these
            regions that will allow us to identify positional
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariation</ENAMEX> and subsequently to predict a new
            structural element. Thus, at this stage in the
            development of the alignments, the most conserved
            regions ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, hour hand regions) and
            semi-conserved regions ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, minute hand regions) have
            been aligned with high confidence. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">sub-second</TIMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth and hundredth</NUMEX> of a
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>) hand regions have been aligned for many of the
            sequences on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> at the ends on the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. However, regions of the sequences
            continue to challenge us. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">545 and 1707</NUMEX>
            regions ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli numbering</ENAMEX>) contain an
            excessive amount of variation in the Eucarya
            nuclear-encoded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23S</NUMEX>-like rRNAs. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions could
            not be well aligned and we could not predict a common
            structure with comparative analysis with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> Eucaryotic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> (see Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35-43</NUMEX> in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] ).
            However, once a larger number of related Eucaryotic
            23S-like rRNA sequences was determined, we reanalyzed
            these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions and were able to align those regions
            to other related organisms ( 
            e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae with 
            Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
            Cryptococcus neoformans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pneumocystis</ENAMEX> carinii, Candida
            albicans, and 
            Mucor racemosus ) and predict a
            secondary structure that is common for all of these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNAs</ENAMEX> (see Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 6</NUMEX> in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] ). While the
            secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for the fungal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23S</NUMEX>-like rRNAs are
            determined in these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal rRNAs</ENAMEX> were only
            partially solved. We still need to determine a common
            secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for the large variable-sized
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertions</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal rRNAs</ENAMEX>, and this will require
            even more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> 23S-like rRNA sequences from organisms
            that are very closely related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> for
            which we currently have sequences.
          
          
            A large sampling of secondary structure
            diagrams
            We have generated secondary structure diagrams for
            sequences that represent the major phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
            and for those sequences that reveal the major forms of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structure conservation and variation. New
            secondary structure diagrams are templated from an
            existing secondary structure diagram and the alignment
            of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two sequences</TIMEX>, the sequence for the new
            structure diagram and the sequence for the structure
            that has been templated. The nucleotides in the new
            sequence replace the templated sequence when they are
            in the same position in the alignment, while positions
            in the new sequence that are not juxtaposed with a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> in the templated sequence are initially left
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unstructured</ENAMEX>. These nucleotides are then placed
            interactively into their correct location in the
            structure diagram with the program XRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weiser</ENAMEX> &
            Noller, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>) and
            base-paired when there is comparative support for that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairing</ENAMEX> in the alignment; otherwise, they are left
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpaired</ENAMEX>.
            The process of generating these secondary structure
            diagrams occurs in parallel with the development of the
            sequence alignments. In some cases, the generation of a
            structure diagram helps us identify problems with the
            sequence or its alignment. For example, anomalies in
            structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (in the new structure diagram) that
            had strong comparative support in the other sequences
            could be the result of a bad sequence or due to the
            misalignment of sequences in the helix region. In other
            cases, the new structure diagram reveals a possible
            helix in a variable region that was weakly predicted
            with comparative analysis. However, a re-inspection of
            a few related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> diagrams revealed another
            potential helix in this region that was then
            substantiated from an analysis of the corresponding
            region of the alignment. Thus, the process of
            generating additional secondary structure diagrams
            improves the sequence alignments and the predicted
            structures, in addition to the original purpose for
            these diagrams, to reveal the breadth of sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> and variation for any one <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> type.
            Our goals for the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sequence and Structure Data</ENAMEX>"
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section of the CRW Site</ENAMEX> are to:
            A) Align all rRNA, group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> intron sequences
            that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> complete and are available at
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>;
            B) Generate rRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II intron</ENAMEX> secondary
            structure diagrams for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> structural element. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5S</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> rRNAs secondary
            structures from genomic sequences generally has higher
            priority over other rRNA sequences.
            C) Enter pertinent information for each sequence and
            structure into our relational database management
            system. This computer system organizes all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structure entries, associates them with
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>' complete NCBI phylogeny
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">html/,</ENAMEX>
            and allows for the efficient retrieval of this data
            (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 4</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Access Systems</ENAMEX> for more
            details).
            Due in part to the technological improvements in the
            determination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> sequence information, the
            number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> and group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> intron
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> has increased significantly within the past
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>, the approximate numbers
            of complete or nearly complete sequences and secondary
            structure diagrams for each of these RNAs for the major
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and structural categories are shown
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Highlight 3A.1</ENAMEX>. At this time, the actual number of
            sequences that are both <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> complete and
            available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> is greater than the number in our
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CRW RDBMS</ENAMEX>.
            The sequences, alignments, and secondary structure
            diagrams are available from several different web
            pages, which are described below in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sections 3A-3D</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4A-4B</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            3A. Index of available sequences and
            structures
            The top section of the "Index of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Available Sequences</ENAMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Structures</ENAMEX>" page (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3A.1</ENAMEX>) reveals the numbers of
            available sequences for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eucarya</ENAMEX> nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast groups
            that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 90%</NUMEX> complete and structure diagrams
            for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5S</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNAs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. The remainder of the index page contains the
            numbers of sequences and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for more expanded
            lists for each of those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenetic</ENAMEX>/cell location
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> are expanded to the
            Crenarchaeota, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota, Korarchaeota</ENAMEX>, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unclassified Archaea</ENAMEX>. These counts are updated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamically</ENAMEX> when the information in our relational
            database management system is revised. The numbers of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> are links that open the RDBMS
            "standard" output view (see below for details) for the
            selected target set. Secondary structure diagrams are
            available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PostScript</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDF</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPSEQ</ENAMEX> (see above)
            formats from the structure links. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> names in
            the output from these links are sorted alphabetically.
            The number of entries per output page is selectable
            (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 50, 100, 200</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">400</NUMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> set as a default.
            Entries not shown on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> can be viewed by
            clicking on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Next</ENAMEX>" button at the bottom left of the
            output page.
            As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>, our data collection contains
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11,464 rRNA</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5S</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX>) and intron (group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>,
            and other) sequences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNAs</ENAMEX> comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
            of this total, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rRNA represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> of the rRNA
            total; the remainder is split between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23S</NUMEX> and 5S
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNAs</ENAMEX>. Intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of our total
            collection, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately twice as many</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
            introns than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II introns. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">406</NUMEX> secondary
            structure diagrams, the majority are for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>)
            and 23S (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) rRNAs. At this time, tRNA records are not
            maintained in our database system.
          
          
            3B. New secondary structure diagrams
            Secondary structure diagrams that have been created
            or modified recently are listed and available from
            their own page (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3B.1</ENAMEX>). These diagrams are sorted into
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories: new or modified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in the past
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> (highlighted with red text); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) in the past
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> (blue text); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three months</TIMEX>
            (black text). Diagrams are listed alphabetically by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organism</ENAMEX> name within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the three time</TIMEX> categories.
            The display also indicates the cell location and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            Class (see below) for each diagram. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PostScript</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDF</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPSEQ</ENAMEX> files can be viewed by clicking the
            appropriate radio button at the top of this page and
            then the links in the structure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            3C. Secondary structure diagram retrieval
            Multiple secondary structure diagrams can be
            downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secondary Structure Retrieval</ENAMEX> Page
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Highlight 3C.1</ENAMEX>). This system allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to select
            from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> names, phylogeny (general: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eukaryota</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Virus</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> Class (see Table
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and cell location, as well as selecting for
            PostScript, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDF</ENAMEX>, or BPSEQ display formats. Once these
            selections are made, a list of the structure diagrams
            that fit those criteria appears. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> may select
            any or all of the diagrams to be downloaded. The 23S
            rRNA diagrams (which appear in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX>) are
            presented on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> line as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> to ensure that
            both halves are downloaded. The system packages the
            secondary structure diagrams files into a compressed
            tar file, which can be uncompressed with appropriate
            software on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windows</ENAMEX>, and Unix computer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platforms</ENAMEX>. (Note: due to a limitation in the web server
            software, it is currently not possible to reliably
            download <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. This
            limitation can be avoided by subdividing large
            queries.)
          
          
            3D. Sequence alignment retrieval
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequence Alignment Retrieval</ENAMEX> page (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlight</ENAMEX>
            3D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>) provides access to the sequence alignments used

            The highlights from rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 1</ENAMEX> are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) As
            of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>, there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1184</TIMEX> publicly available
            introns that occur in the rRNAs, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> in the 16S
            rRNA, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">284</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23S</TIMEX> rRNA. These introns are
            distributed over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">152</NUMEX> different positions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> in the 16S
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23S</TIMEX> rRNA. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Although 16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> is
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> half the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>, there are
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> times as many introns in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rRNA.
            However, this bias is due, at least in part, to the
            more prevalent sampling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16S</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16S</NUMEX>-like rRNAs for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The sampling of introns at the intron
            positions is not evenly distributed (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1184/152</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.79</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns per</ENAMEX> position for a random sampling). Instead,
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 50%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">71/152</NUMEX>) of the intron positions contain a
            single intron and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">135/152</NUMEX>) of the intron positions
            contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or less introns. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">681/1163</NUMEX>) of the introns are located at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> positions and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> intron positions with
            the most introns (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">943, 516</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rRNA)
            contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">361</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">361/1163</NUMEX>), of the rRNA introns. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 1D</ENAMEX> compares the observed
            distribution of rRNA introns with the Poisson
            distribution for the observed number of introns. The
            Poisson distribution, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>(x) = 
            e -μμ 
            x 
            x! <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>, where μ is the mean
            frequency of introns for positions in a particular exon
            and 
            x is the target number of introns
            present at a particular position, allows the
            calculation of expected numbers of positions containing
            a particular number of introns. Based upon the observed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">raw</ENAMEX> numbers of introns in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S and 23S</TIMEX> rRNAs, we
            expect to see no positions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rRNA containing more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> introns and no positions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23S</TIMEX> rRNA
            containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> introns. However,
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">thirty-five</NUMEX> rRNA positions fall into one of those two
            categories. We also see both more positions without
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> and fewer positions containing only one or two
            introns than expected. This observed distribution of
            rRNA introns among the available insertion positions is
            extremely unlikely to occur by chance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) While a
            single intron type occurs at the majority of the intron
            positions, several positions have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> intron
            type. A few of the positions that deserve special
            attention have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> introns at the same position
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> rRNA positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">516 and 1199</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> rRNA position
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2563</TIMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA position 788 has several examples
            each of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX>, and I introns.

            Distribution
            The distribution of introns on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the phylogenetic</TIMEX> tree
            is tabulated in rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 3A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3E.8</ENAMEX>) and 3B
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3E.9</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 3A</ENAMEX> reveals the ratio of
            the number of rRNA introns per rRNA gene for the
            nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial encoded RNAs
            for the major phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The most noteworthy
            distributions are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>) of the rRNA
            introns occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eucarya</ENAMEX>, followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>, and
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> rRNA intron has been
            documented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>; due to the large number of
            rRNA gene sequences that have been determined, the
            ratio of rRNA introns per rRNA gene is essentially zero
            for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The frequency of introns in
            Archaea rRNAs is higher, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> examples documented as
            of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>, there is a higher
            ratio of rRNA introns in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desulfurococcales</ENAMEX> and
            Thermoproteales subbranches in the Crenarchaeota
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> primary phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
            the highest ratio of rRNA introns per rRNA gene is for
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eucarya</ENAMEX>, and for the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> within the
            Eucarya that have significant numbers of rRNA
            sequences, the ratio is highest in the fungi. Here, the
            ratios of rRNA introns per rRNA gene are similar
            between the nucleus and mitochondria (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.34</NUMEX> for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.20</NUMEX> for the mitochondria). A significant
            number of rRNA introns occurs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, with
            similar ratios of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rRNA intron</ENAMEX>/rRNA gene for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, chloroplast, and mitochondria (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.36</NUMEX> for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.38</NUMEX> for the chloroplast, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.34</NUMEX> for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX>). In sharp contrast with the fungi and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> intron has been documented in an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal rRNA</ENAMEX>, occurring within the 
            Calliphora vicina nuclear-encoded
            23S-like rRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K02309</NUMEX>).
            Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> special "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unclassified</ENAMEX>" rRNA intron
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> has a specific phylogenetic bias. Archaeal rRNA
            introns, which have unique sequence and structural
            characteristics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX> ] , have not yet been observed
            within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korarchaeota</ENAMEX>; in fact, no
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Archaeal</ENAMEX> introns have been found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archaea</ENAMEX> rRNAs
            to date. Splicesomal rRNA introns have only been
            reported in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> different genera in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascomycota</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>
            ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 3A</ENAMEX> also presents the numbers of
            (complete or nearly so) rRNA sequences in the same
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in order to address the question of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">sampling</ENAMEX> bias. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> important caveats to this data must
            be considered. First, the numbers of rRNA sequences are
            an underestimate, since many rRNA introns are published
            with only short flanking exon sequences and do not meet
            the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> completeness criterion for inclusion in this
            rRNA sequence count. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> caveat is that many
            rRNA sequences contain multiple introns (see rRNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introns</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX> and related discussion, below, for more
            information). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>/cell
            location combinations shown in rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 3</ENAMEX>
            that may contain rRNA introns, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>) have a
            intron:rRNA sequence ratio greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, indicating
            a bias toward introns within those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Introns are
            comparatively rare within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 26</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that have
            a ratio below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> groups contain no
            known rRNA introns. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have
            intermediate ratios (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.3 and 1.0</NUMEX>).
            A more detailed phylogenetic distribution is
            available in rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 3B</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3E.10</ENAMEX>). The first
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fields contain levels <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of the NCBI
            phylogeny, followed by fields for the genus of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX>, cell location, exon (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>), and
            intron type. Each of these classifications include a
            link to the complete details (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> name, phylogeny,

            per rRNA gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3E.11</ENAMEX>). While <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80%</NUMEX> of the
            documented rRNA genes do not have an intron, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">646</NUMEX> 16S
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182</NUMEX> 23S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNAs</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> intron.
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 75%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">623</ENAMEX>) of these genes have a single
            intron, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">127</ENAMEX>) have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> introns, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</NUMEX>) have
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>) have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>) have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, two
            rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> introns, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> rRNA gene
            has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> introns.
            To determine the amount of bias in the distribution
            of introns among their exon sequences, the Poisson
            distribution (here, μ is the mean frequency of introns
            for a particular exon and 
            x is the target number of introns
            per rRNA gene) has been used to calculate the number of
            rRNA sequences expected to contain a given number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> (rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 4</ENAMEX>). Based upon this data,
            no rRNA sequences are expected to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>; in fact, we see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> sequences that contain
            these large numbers of introns. The observed numbers of
            sequences exceed the expected values for all but one
            category: fewer rRNAs contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> intron than
            expected.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>) show a
            differing trend with respect to cell location for those
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> containing large numbers of introns. In 16S
            rRNA, only nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>) have been observed to
            contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more introns; indeed, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
            containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more introns, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> are not
            nuclear (both of these are mitochondrial). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23S</TIMEX> rRNA,
            the trend is both opposite and weaker; of the thirteen
            rRNA sequences containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more introns, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
            are nuclear (containing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five introns</NUMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroplast</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> comprising the
            remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> sequences.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Introns Table 4</ENAMEX> provides access to seventeen
            additional tables (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3E.12</ENAMEX>), which each present the
            complete information for every intron within a
            particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> ( 
            e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16S rRNA genes</ENAMEX> containing
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> introns), grouped by their exons. As with the other
            online tables, this information will be updated daily
            to reflect new intron sequences that are added to this
            database.
            The final components of the "rRNA Introns" page are

            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-3E.13</ENAMEX>). The information collected here on the "rRNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introns</ENAMEX>" page is the basis for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> detailed analyses
            that will be published elsewhere: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the spatial

            our interfaces to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW RDBMS</ENAMEX> information. While the
            restricted, specialized interface to the RDBMS
            information in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 3A</ENAMEX> requires minimal instruction
            to use, the standard interface, with its ability to
            cull out all arrangements of information from the
            different fields with sophisticated search queries and
            output field sortings, requires a quick lesson for its
            operation. The selection process has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stages: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
            selection of attribute fields to display; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
            determination of values for the search; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
            adjustment of the output field sort order.
            A detailed explanation for each of the attributes is
            available from the links to the attribute names. This
            information is shown in the right frame. Additional
            examples of this system are available online.
            Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. At the onset, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> selects the fields to
            be displayed on the screen and then clicks the "Go"
            button. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can select the individual fields
            ( 
            e.g., "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Organism" or "Phylogeny</ENAMEX>"),
            for most applications the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">QrRNA</ENAMEX>" (query rRNA),
            "Qintron" (query intron), or "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All</ENAMEX>" options will
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">automatically</ENAMEX> click the appropriate fields that are
            most important for searching for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> or group
            I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> entries.
            Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Select values for the fields or attributes.
            The acceptable values for the attributes in our RDBMS
            system are shown on the main frame of the query page
            (for list- and button-driven fields) or, for text input
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fields</ENAMEX>, can be determined with the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V"</ENAMEX> (values) button
            on the right side of the main frame; the results are
            displayed in the right frame (see Figure 3and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A.1</NUMEX>).
            • The values for cellular location are Chl
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">chloroplast</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cya</ENAMEX> (cyanelle), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mit</ENAMEX> (mitochondria), Nuc
            (nuclear), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vir</ENAMEX> (viral); each can be selected by
            simply checking the box to the left of its name.
            • The values for the attributes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RNA Type</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> (open
            reading frame), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Secondary Structures</ENAMEX> (entries
            with/without secondary structure diagrams),
            Results/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Page</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Color Display</ENAMEX> are also displayed on
            the main frame, and can be selected by clicking the
            appropriate box or button.
            The values for other attributes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> Class,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence Length</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> can be determined by
            selecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the values in the scroll box.
            The values for these attributes can also be found by
            clicking the "V" button associated with each attribute.
            For example, clicking on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Exon"</ENAMEX> "V" button will
            reveal, in the right frame, all of the exons that are
            contained in our database. The same exons are present
            in the scroll box.
            • The values displayed for any one attribute are
            dependent on the settings of the other attributes. For
            example, when only rRNA is selected for the "<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RNA Type</ENAMEX>,"
            then there are no values for "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exon</ENAMEX>." All of the
            possible exon values are displayed when "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Intron</ENAMEX>" is the
            selected "<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RNA Type</ENAMEX>," while only a subset of the
            possible exon values are shown when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mit</ENAMEX> (mitochondria)
            is the selected "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cell Location</ENAMEX>." Note: no selection for
            an attribute signifies to this system that all of the
            values are possible.
            The values present in our database for the
            attributes "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organism</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Phylogeny</ENAMEX>" (except for the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> level - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archaea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eukaryota</ENAMEX> - that
            can be selected from the main frame), "Common Name"
            (except for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> level: "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animals</ENAMEX>,"
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fungi&Plants</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Protists</ENAMEX>"), "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Accession Number</ENAMEX>,"
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intron Position</ENAMEX>," and "Comment" can only be observed
            in the right frame after clicking the "V" button.
            • The values selected with the mouse in the right
            frame will appear in the appropriate attribute
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>.
            • The values for each attribute are dependent on the
            settings for the other attributes. For example, if
            there are many values for the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Organism</ENAMEX>" field,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">selecting Archaea</ENAMEX> in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phylogeny</ENAMEX>" field will reduce
            the number of names in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Organism</ENAMEX>" field to just
            those that are in this phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
            • The number of possible values for an attribute can
            also be constrained by entering only part of a value in
            the field. For example, typing 'Esch' in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Organism</ENAMEX>"
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> will output several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> names that contain
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Escherichia</ENAMEX>' when the "V" button is clicked. Typing
            "coli" in this field will list all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> names that
            contain "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX>," as either part of a name or a complete
            word.
            • Note that the system is case sensitive for all
            fields except "Common Name." The text 'esch' in the
            same "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Organism</ENAMEX>" field will not output 'Escherichia' in
            the right frame.
            The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phylogeny</ENAMEX>" field with the values frame on the
            right was developed to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to navigate
            through the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The information for the
            "Phylogeny" and "Common Name" fields is downloaded from
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods</ENAMEX>; this information
            is downloaded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to assure that we have the most
            current version of this data). There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general
            modes of operation.
            For mode <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, you can systematically navigate
            through the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> to the selected goal
            point. For example, to get to the last phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> that contains 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorillas</ENAMEX>, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> would click on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eukaryota</ENAMEX>" phylogeny button,
            then click on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fungi/Metazoa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>" link in the
            right frame, followed by the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metazoa</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eumetazoa</ENAMEX>,"
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilateria</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coelomata</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deuterostomia</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chordata</ENAMEX>,"
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craniata</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vertebrata</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gnathostomata</ENAMEX>,"
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teleostomi</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Euteleostomi</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarcopterygii</ENAMEX>,"
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tetrapoda</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amniota</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mammalia</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theria</ENAMEX>,"
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eutheria</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primates</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catarrhini</ENAMEX>," and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hominidae</ENAMEX>"
            links. The phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hominidae</ENAMEX> contains the
            genera <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Gorilla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pongo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo</ENAMEX> (see
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4A.1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4A.2</ENAMEX>). This type of navigation
            is useful when you know the links that will get you to
            the desired goal point; otherwise, mode <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> can help
            you jump to the appropriate node in the phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
            For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mode, you type all or part of the
            name of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> or phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that is close
            to the phylogenetic node you want. For example, type
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX>" in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phylogeny</ENAMEX>" field and press the
            "V" button in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phylogeny</ENAMEX>" field. The right frame
            will display a few names; from these, select "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sapiens</ENAMEX>." The right frame now contains the entire
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> from the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humans</ENAMEX>
            (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and H-4A.1</ENAMEX>).
            The "Common Name" attribute can also help identify
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">organism</ENAMEX> names in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW RDBMS</ENAMEX>. As with the phylogeny
            operation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general modes for determining the values
            are available. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> would type the
            presumed common name in the "Common Name" field, and
            click the "V" button. A few general examples are: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>, and human. More specific examples are:
            common earthworm ( 
            Lumbricus terrestris ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polecat</ENAMEX> ( 
            Mustela putorius ), and duckbill
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platypus</ENAMEX> ( 
            Ornithorhynchus anatinus ). These
            names must be in the "Common Name" database for the
            sequence entry to be identified with this method. In
            contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mode is intended to identify
            larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> buttons in the
            "Common Name" field (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Animals</ENAMEX>," "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fungi&Plants</ENAMEX>,"
            "Protists;" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4A.3</ENAMEX>) each reveal various low-level
            common names in the right frame that are arranged in a
            pseudo-phylogenetic structure. For example, a few of
            the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (sponges, flatworms, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> ) are listed when the
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animals</ENAMEX>" button is pressed, in addition to the
            Protostomia, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deuterostomia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms nested</ENAMEX> within
            these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthropoda</ENAMEX>, chordates, vertebrates,
            Mammals, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.; H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A.3</NUMEX>). Accordingly, the
            "Fungi&Plants" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Protists</ENAMEX>" buttons reveal the
            major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> within their respective
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For the latter mode of operation, the user
            selects one of these common names, such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mammals</ENAMEX>."
            The phylogeny for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> then appears in the same
            right frame (cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eukaryota</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fungi/Metazoa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metazoa, Eumetazoa, Bilateria</ENAMEX>,
            Coelomata, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deuterostomia, Chordata, Craniata</ENAMEX>,
            Vertebrata, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gnathostomata, Teleostomi, Euteleostomi</ENAMEX>,
            Sarcopterygii, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrapoda, Amniota, Mammalia</ENAMEX>), along
            with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> within the Mammals
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mammalia</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prototheria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theria</ENAMEX>. Another example is
            the common name "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mosses</ENAMEX>" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fungi&Plants</ENAMEX>.
            Selecting "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mosses</ENAMEX>" brings up the phylogeny for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryophyta</ENAMEX>. Note that these common names ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, "mammals" or "mosses") do
            not appear in the common name field in the output for
            the sequence entries that are within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mammalian</ENAMEX> or
            Bryophyta phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Thus, the common name
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> could be very useful to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and
            phylogenetically related organisms when you don't know
            their genus/species <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> name or the phylogeny for
            that group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
            Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The last, critical step before submitting a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> is to select the sort order for the attributes in
            the output. While a query will yield the same number of
            results with any sort order, the choice of sort order
            can make answering questions easier. Take, for example,
            a search for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eucarya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> entries. By default, the
            entries are sorted alphabetically first by their
            phylogenetic classification, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> name,
            cell location, and last by their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA class</ENAMEX>. In
            contrast, the sort orders <phylogeny, organism=name,
            cell location, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA class></ENAMEX> and <organism name,</txt>=<txt>            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA class</ENAMEX>, phylogeny, and cell location> produce
            significantly different orders and overall arrangements
            for the same set of entries (see online examples); the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sorting is more useful when searching for a
            particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, since its exact location on the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> may not be known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. The
            output page (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4A.2</ENAMEX>) reveals the search strategy and
            attribute sort order at the bottom of the page. The
            default sort order for the attributes is shown on the
            "S" (or sort) buttons on the right side of the main
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frame</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and H-4A.1</ENAMEX>). The sort order is changed
            by simply clicking the "S" buttons in the order the
            attributes are to be sorted. The resulting sort order
            for the attributes are shown in the small text box to
            the left of each attribute's S button; alternatively,
            you can type numbers into these boxes to set the sort
            order. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alphabetical</ENAMEX>/numerical order for any
            attribute can be reversed (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">z -> a</ENAMEX>, high number ->
            low number) by checking the box in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>" (or reverse)
            column to the right of the Sort buttons. Finally, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sortings</ENAMEX> can be reset to the default values by clicking
            the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sort Reset</ENAMEX>" button at the top of the query
            page.
            Before submitting the query, a few attributes
            deserve more attention.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">• Secondary Structures</ENAMEX>: a comparative secondary
            structure model has been developed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400</NUMEX> of
            the sequence entries (see Section 3). The 'secondary
            structure' attribute near the bottom of the query page
            is an option to output 
            all sequence and structure
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, only those entries 
            with a secondary structure, or
            entries 
            without a secondary structure

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhyloBrowser interface</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW RDBMS</ENAMEX> was
            developed to facilitate the identification and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrieval</ENAMEX> of sequence and structure entries that are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with specific phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. While the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard interface</ENAMEX> will reveal all sequence entries for
            any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, it does not show the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that do not have the requested
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PhyloBrowser interface</ENAMEX> displays the
            entire phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, including those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> that
            do not have corresponding entries. This interface is
            based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxonomy Browser</ENAMEX> developed by NCBI
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">html/</ENAMEX>and
            uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> taxonomy database [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] . Here, we
            describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhyloBrowser interface</ENAMEX>, ways to navigate
            through the phylogenetic data, and how to retrieve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            information using this system.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhyloBrowser</ENAMEX> uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> frames (Figure 4and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B.1</NUMEX>). At the bottom of the page is the Results Frame
            (white background), which displays the selected portion
            of the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> information. In
            the upper left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Selection Frame</ENAMEX> (pink
            background), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can select the phylogenetic
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> information shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Results Frame</ENAMEX>. Help is
            provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Help Frame</ENAMEX>, at the upper right (blue
            background).
            Starting at the root, the entire phylogenetic tree
            can be navigated with this system. The base
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> level name is shown in green. The number
            of phylogenetic levels displayed (below the base level)
            can be modulated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (the default) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> levels
            using the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Display Phylogenetic Levels</ENAMEX>" control in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selection Frame</ENAMEX>. The phylogenetic level number for each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is shown in red preceding the phylogenetic group
            name, and common name information, where available, is
            shown in black text in parentheses after the group
            name. Each phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> name is a link that
            reveals additional phylogenetic levels (Figure 4and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B.1</NUMEX>), allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to navigate onto the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> of the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
            In addition to this mode of transversing the
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, starting at the root and knowing the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> to the desired end point, this system has the
            facility to jump to specific places in the phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> can enter a partial or complete
            scientific or common name in the white text field in
            the lower, purple-colored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selection Frame</ENAMEX>
            ( 
            e.g., "human;" see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4B.2</ENAMEX>). Once
            the appropriate scientific or common name radio button
            is set, different names that satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-entered
            text can be viewed in the Results Frame by checking the
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">View</ENAMEX>" box. Clicking the appropriate name in the
            Results Frame will enter that name into the text field;
            unchecking the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">View</ENAMEX>" check box and clicking "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Submit</ENAMEX>"
            will reveal the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4B.3</ENAMEX>).
            To navigate toward the root of the phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tree,</ENAMEX> click the "Parents" button in the Selection
            Frame. This will open a new window with the complete
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> phylogeny from the root to the level of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX> of interest. This window (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4B.4</ENAMEX>) also reveals
            the phylogenetic level number and common names. Simply
            clicking on a node name in this window ( 
            e.g., the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eutheria</ENAMEX>" node in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B.4</NUMEX>) will reveal this section of the phylogenetic

            These values in brackets link to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX> RDBMS
            results page, as described in the previous section, and
            allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to view the available sequence and

            4C. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RNA Structure Query System</ENAMEX>
            Currently, we are unable to reliably and accurately
            predict an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> from its underlying sequence
            due in part to the lack of more fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            structure rules that relate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sequences
            with specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> structural elements. Given this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>, we have utilized comparative analysis to
            determine that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> that is common to a set of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functionally</ENAMEX> and structurally equivalent sequences.
            This analysis, as mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, is very accurate:
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 98%</NUMEX> of the basepairings in our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> rRNA
            comparative structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are present in the
            high-resolution crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">30S</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ]
            and 50S [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal subunits</ENAMEX>. In the process of
            predicting these comparative structure models, we have
            determined a large number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5S</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> and
            group I intron comparative structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> from
            sequences that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of all types of
            structural variations and conservation. Thus, with the
            correct rRNA structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and a large sampling of
            structurally diverse structure models, we now want to
            decipher more relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequences</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> structural elements. Toward this end, we developed
            a system for the identification of biases in short
            sequences associated with simple structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in
            our set of comparative structure models. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set
            of examples reveals a sampling of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based
            sequence biases. Recently, we utilized this system to
            identify and quantitate the following biases for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenosines</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bacterial 16S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> rRNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">covariation</ENAMEX>-based structure models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 2/3</NUMEX> of the adenosines are unpaired; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of loops in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> and
            23S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> have an A; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) there is a bias for adenosines
            to be adjacent to other adenosines (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX> of these are at
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unpaired positions, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of these are at
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">paired/unpaired junctions</ENAMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) the majority of the
            As at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of loops are adjacent to a paired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX>
            These results were discerned with this system and are
            shown in part in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5and H-4C</ENAMEX>.
            This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sequence/structure query system has three

            nucleotide/structural element. The options for each of
            these fields are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. The system
            currently supports <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> types (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5S</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX>, and 23S

            nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial, and chloroplast). Any
            combination and number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and
            phylogenetic/cell location <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> can be selected,
            although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> type and one
            phylogenetic/cell location <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> must be selected. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bacterial 16S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">23S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNAs</ENAMEX> were selected for the
            examples in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5and H-4C</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> nucleotide
            categories are searchable: single nucleotides, (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>)
            adjacent nucleotides, base pairs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nucleotides,
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides. Each category can be searched
            against a defined set of structural elements, as
            outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. The structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> categories are based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) positions that
            are paired and unpaired and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) positions at the center
            or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of helices and loops.
            The sorting function dynamically ranks the
            nucleotide patterns. The resulting output reveals, for
            any of the selected structural elements, the most
            frequent nucleotide pattern, followed by other patterns
            in descending order to the least frequent nucleotide
            pattern. For the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Story</ENAMEX>" example mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenosine</ENAMEX> is the most frequent nucleotide at unpaired
            positions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42.64%</NUMEX>), followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.6%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.27%</NUMEX>),
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.49%</NUMEX>) (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5and H-4C.1</ENAMEX>). These values are
            contained in the orange columns, and reveal the
            percentages for each of the nucleotides within each of
            the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> listed ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, paired, unpaired, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> ). This same figure reveals
            that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.5%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of loops contain an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpaired</ENAMEX> to paired ratio is shown in yellow in Figure
            5and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4C.1</ENAMEX>; this ratio is greatest for adenosines,
            where the value is nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unpaired
            adenosines for every A that is paired), and lowest for
            C, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than three</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> cytosines are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpaired</ENAMEX>. In contrast with the percentage values in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX> boxes that reveal the percentage of nucleotides
            within each structural element, the percentages in the
            green boxes reveal the distribution of nucleotides in
            different structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for each nucleotide. For
            example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.76%</NUMEX> of the adenosines are paired, while
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.24%</NUMEX> are unpaired. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.71%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C's</ENAMEX> are
            paired and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 22.29%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C's</ENAMEX> are unpaired.
            The most common adjacent nucleotides in any
            structural environment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bacterial 16S</ENAMEX> and 23S
            rRNAs are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.86%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4C.2</ENAMEX>), while in loops the most
            common dinucleotides are AA (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.2%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4C.3</ENAMEX>), followed
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.35%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.821%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AU</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.703%</NUMEX>), 
            etc. The most frequent adjacent
            nucleotides at the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3'loop-5'helix</NUMEX> junction are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.99%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-4C.4</ENAMEX>), followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.28%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.28%</NUMEX>), 
            etc. For the adjacent AA
            sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 75%</NUMEX> occur in loops, while
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 12%</NUMEX> of the AA sequences occur in helices,
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">another 12%</NUMEX> occur at the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3'loop-5'helix</NUMEX> junction, and
            less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> occur in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'helix-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'loop junctions. Thus,
            these analyses of single and adjacent nucleotides
            reveal several strong biases in the distribution of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in different structural environments.
            The top section of the output page (Figure 5and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C.1</NUMEX>) displays the types of data (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules and
            phylogenetic/cell location <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>) that were selected
            and analyzed. This section also reveals the number of
            structure models that were analyzed; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">175 16S</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> 23S
            rRNA structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were analyzed in Figure 5and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>.
            A few of the other biases in the distribution of
            nucleotide patterns that were determined with this
            sequence/structure query system of our comparative
            structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are displayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. A more

        Conclusions
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nearly 10 years ago</TIMEX>, our initial goals for our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> web
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">page</ENAMEX> was to disseminate some of the comparative information
        we collected and analyzed for our prediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16S</ENAMEX> and 23S
        rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with comparative analysis. With dramatic
        increases in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA sequences</ENAMEX>, we
        developed a relational database system to organize basic
        information about each sequence and structure entry to
        maintain an inventory of our collection, and to retrieve
        any one or set of entries that satisfy the conditions of
        the search. In parallel, with the significant advancements
        in computational and networking hardware and software, our
        need for more detailed and quantitative comparative
        information for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA molecule</ENAMEX> under study, and our
        interest in studying more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> and 23S
        rRNA, we have greatly expanded our web site, and named it
        the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Comparative RNA Web"</ENAMEX> (CRW) Site.
        The major types of information available for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        molecule are:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the current comparative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> model;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) nucleotide and base pair frequency tables for all
        positions in the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) secondary structure conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diagrams</ENAMEX> that reveal
        the extent of conservation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequence</ENAMEX> and
        structure;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) representative secondary structure diagrams for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> from phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that span the
        phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and reveal the major forms of structural
        variation;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) a semi-complete/partial collection of publicly
        available sequences that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> or more complete; and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) sequence alignments.
        At this time, we maintain the most current comparative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structure information about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> and 23S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX>. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules we maintain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>, tRNA,
        and group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> introns) are not as advanced at the time
        of this writing.
        Our future aims for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Site</ENAMEX> are to: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) maintain a
        complete collection of sequences in our database management
        system for each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> under study; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) once or twice a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, release new sequence alignments that contain A)
        improvements (if necessary) in the positioning of the
        sequences that are associated with similar structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) increases in the number of aligned
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) generate more secondary structure diagrams
        for sequences that span the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and reveal
        all forms of structural variation; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) generate more
        secondary structure conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diagrams</ENAMEX> and nucleotide
        and base pair frequency tables for more phylogenetic groups
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">e.g. Fungi: Basidiomycota</ENAMEX>,
        Ascomycota, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zygomycota</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) update the structure models
        when warranted by the analysis; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) update current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> and base pair frequency tables when the
        alignments they are derived from have been updated, and
        generate more frequency tables for more phylogenetic groups
        (see "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)" above); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) add new types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">comparative RNA</ENAMEX>
        sequence/structure information and new modes of presenting
        the data; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) analyze more types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules from a
        comparative perspective, and present this data in the same
        formats utilized for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules currently
        supported.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence</ENAMEX> collection
          The majority of the sequence alignments presented at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRW Site</ENAMEX> were assembled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. The
          alignments that were based on another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s
          initial effort and enlarged and refined for the CRW
          project are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the prokaryotic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>)
          alignments for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16S rRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5S</TIMEX> rRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] ; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the tRNA alignments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX> ] .
          The group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> intron alignments were originally
          based upon sequences collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 34</NUMEX> ] .
          New rRNA and intron sequences were found by searching
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> sequence database at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Entrez</ENAMEX> system <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/Entrez/</ENAMEX>at
          least once per week with appropriate search criteria ( 
          e.g., "rrna" [Feature key] and
          "intron" [Feature key] to find introns that occur in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rRNA</ENAMEX>). While the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sequences of
          importance to this database are available online at
          GenBank, a few sequences are only available in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literature</ENAMEX> ( 
          e.g., the 
          Urospora penicilliformis intron [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> ] ) or in a thesis; these sequences were manually

          entered into the appropriate sequence alignment. A few
          sequences were found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> with the sequence
          similarity searching program BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX> ] . At this time,
          we are only trying to identify all sequences that are
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> complete since all sequences that are less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> complete are not currently retrieved with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CRW RDBMS</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Deviations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> entries
          The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> entries contain accurate
          annotations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>. However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">GenBank</ENAMEX> entries
          deviate from this norm in a variety of ways. In some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entries</ENAMEX>, the presence of the rRNA was not annotated and
          the rRNA was found by searching for short sequences that
          are characteristic of that rRNA (a few examples).
          Sometimes, intron sequences are not annotated and were
          discovered during the alignment of the corresponding rRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> ( 
          e.g., the unannotated intron in the
          uncultured archaeon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAGMA-B 16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AB050206</NUMEX>) and many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fungi</ENAMEX>, including AF401965 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX> ] ). Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> entries
          contain incorrect annotations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>; the
          boundaries may be misidentified by a small or large
          number of nucleotides.

            The sequence alignments used for this analysis are
            maintained by us at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX>; these
            alignments, containing all publicly available sequences
            used in the analysis, are or will be available from the

            and cell location, the intron alignments are sorted by
            subgroup, exon, insertion point (for rRNA introns), and
            phylogeny, and the tRNA alignments are sorted by

            collection and the high level of sequence conservation
            at intron insertion points provide great confidence in
            this evaluation.
          
          
            Classification of introns
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Group I and II</ENAMEX> intron sequences were classified into
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] or the more recently determined subgroup <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> ]
            based upon sequence and structural homology to
            previously-aligned sequences. Uncertainties in these
            assignments come from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. First, some
            introns are referred to in rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> entries without
            the intron sequence being provided; in these cases, we
            represent the intron as having length "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NSEQ</ENAMEX>" (No
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEQuence</ENAMEX> information) and accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' major
            intron classification ( 
            e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) but
            not the specific intron type ( 
            e.g., if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> classified an
            intron as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IA1</ENAMEX> and did not publish the sequence, our
            system designates its type as "I"). In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> case,
            we do have sequence information but cannot fully
            classify the intron with confidence; here, we provide
            the most plausible classification. The classifications
            "I" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">II</ENAMEX>," respectively, are group <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> introns
            of undefined subtype. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> described as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IB</ENAMEX>' has
            the characteristic features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IB</ENAMEX> subgroup but
            cannot be subclassified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IB1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IB2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IB3</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IB4</TIMEX>. Those
            introns that do not belong to either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I or group
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> are generally classified as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unknown</ENAMEX>" in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
            Class" field (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>); included in
            this category are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeal</ENAMEX> and spliceosomal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. At present, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeal</ENAMEX> and spliceosomal
            introns are identified with the phrases "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Archaeal</ENAMEX>" and
            "spliceosomal," respectively, in the Comment field of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDBMS</ENAMEX>; a standard designation for these introns
            will be added to a future version of the system.
            Although the introns in our collection have been
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judiciously</ENAMEX> placed into one of the intron <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> and
            are roughly correct, these intron placements will be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reanalyzed</ENAMEX> to assure the accurate assignment of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Identification of unannotated or misannotated
            introns, with examples
            Some examples of introns that were identified or
            clarified by the alignment process are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) 
            Aureoumbra lagunensis (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U40258</TIMEX>;
            the intron was annotated as an insertion); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) 
            Exophiala dermatitidis (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">X78481</TIMEX>;
            the intron was not annotated); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chara sp</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiu</ENAMEX> 96222 (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF191800</TIMEX>;
            the intron annotations were shifted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 15</TIMEX>
            positions toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the rRNA sequence).
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBD</ENAMEX> and NSEQ
            Information that could not be determined either from
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> entries or by using these methods is
            represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDBMS</ENAMEX> system as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">To Be</ENAMEX>
            Determined). When a sequence is known but not available
            (for example, when an intron is inferred from a rRNA
            GenBank entry), the sequence length and percent
            completeness are instead represented as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSEQ</ENAMEX> (No
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEQuence</ENAMEX>), to show that the sequence itself is not
            available.
