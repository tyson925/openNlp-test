        The results of life-detection experiments performed
        almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades ago</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lander</ENAMEX> have
        long been subject to controversy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, though certainly not all [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , have
        concluded that results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX> biological experiments can
        be interpreted as an indication of the presence of strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] , rather than
        biological activity. They suggest that these oxidants are
        capable of oxidizing organic materials causing release of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> as seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX> experiments. Since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> was also released after humidifying a sample of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil, these proposed oxidants would also oxidize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The spontaneous reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) in water
        forms molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The rate of this
        reaction is strongly pH dependent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Other
        observations by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX> have complicated data
        interpretation, including the transient absorption of
        generated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>, perhaps indicating an alkaline
        soil. Also, different thermal sensitivity of carbon dioxide
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> released implied that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> oxidant
        might have been involved in the observed processes or that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> might indeed have been responsible for the observed
        results [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Goldfield, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsapin, et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        suggested that the actual source of oxidative power of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil could be highly redox active oxygen species
        formed in the atmosphere by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunten</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] examined this hypothesis much earlier.
        Further, these oxidative equivalents may then be stabilized
        in the form of high oxidation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of some elements that
        are particularly abundant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil. The most likely
        element is iron, which is thought to represent a major
        fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil matrix [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron</ENAMEX> has a
        set of oxidation states <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between +2 and +6</TIMEX>, with the higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oxidation</ENAMEX> states being very strong oxidants. The reduction
        potential of FeO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 2</NUMEX>-in acidic conditions has been
        determined to be 
        E <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+2.20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> and in alkaline
        conditions 
        E <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+0.72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Thus, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 10</ENAMEX> ] proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) as ferrate dianion
        FeO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 2</NUMEX>-, which is more stable under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alkaline</ENAMEX> rather than acidic conditions, might be an
        important component of the pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martian</ENAMEX> oxidants. They
        demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) displays the essential features of
        organic oxidation to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and water decomposition
        to oxygen that were found with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil during the
        Viking biology experiments. Goldfield, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] further
        propose that the presence of a strong oxidant such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX> would make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martian</ENAMEX> surface self-sterilizing,
        eliminating the possibility for detection of life, or its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remnants</ENAMEX>, on that planet. In support of their hypothesis,
        they conducted spectral and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
        experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>), finding that it destroys <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
        nucleotides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        It is quite possible that iron in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+5</NUMEX> and/or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+6</NUMEX>
        oxidation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is present in the soil of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. However,
        recent observations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mars Odyssey orbiter</ENAMEX> indicate
        that significant amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water ice</ENAMEX> exist at or near the
        surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Since transient temperatures above
        freezing occur at some locations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , this
        water likely would be present at least briefly in the
        liquid form. Under slightly alkaline conditions, as found
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, and in the presence of liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) reacts
        quickly with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and is oxidized to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>). Thus, in
        regions where liquid water forms even briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) is
        less likely to exist. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> is a relatively large
        planet, and conditions across its surface vary. We cannot
        assume that iron exists in the same oxidation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>(s)
        everywhere on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. It is possible that some regions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> might harbor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>), while regions with a
        frequent occurrence of liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> might be dominated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>). Also, it is possible the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) if removed might
        be reformed in a continuing cycle through interactions with
        the planet's atmosphere.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bullock</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] examined the oxidation of
        glycine under simulated Martian conditions and concluded
        that any organic matter brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> surface by
        meteorites likely would be destroyed by UV radiation faster
        than it might be delivered. They further suggested that no
        organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> found on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking Lander Gas</ENAMEX>
        Chromatograph <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass Spectrometer</ENAMEX> experiment could be
        explained without invoking the presence of strong oxidants
        in the surface soils. They felt their estimates of the
        organic destruction rate caused by irradiation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>
        surface were an upper limit for a globally averaged biomass
        production rate that might be comparable to the
        slow-growing cryptoendolithic microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> found
        in dry <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> deserts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        An alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is that given the possible
        presence of ferrate in the soil, the present environmental
        conditions on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> are not highly conducive to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ferrate</ENAMEX>-based oxidation reactions, including those
        potentially affecting dormant and
        hostile-environment-resistant life forms. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> is exposed
        to high fluxes of UV radiation and is very dry (atmospheric
        water = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> ppm) and cold (average temperature is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 218</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-55°C</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-67°F</TIMEX>) with only traces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and with an
        atmosphere composed mostly of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95.32%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7%</NUMEX>; Ar - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.6%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.13%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.08%</NUMEX>; H 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O - 210</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ppm</ENAMEX>; NO - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ppm; Ne - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ppm</ENAMEX>; HDO - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> ppm; Kr - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> ppm; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xe</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> ppm) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] . Thus, in this work experiments were performed to
        further examine the possibility that a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil
        containing significant amounts of ferrate might be
        self-sterilizing due to the highly reactive nature of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>).
        Here synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> FeO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> was prepared and added to dry silica
        sand at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> by weight. Dry endospores of
        the bacterium 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> were then added and
        the mixture incubated under a simulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> environment
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> atmosphere at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-20°C</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of weeks</TIMEX>.
        Results were examined for indications of whether or not the
        presence of ferrate in and of itself was sufficient to make
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martian</ENAMEX> surrogate soil self-sterilizing over a
        non-geologic time frame. The potential sporocidal activity
        of a combination of a powerful soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidant</ENAMEX> (permanganate)
        and high fluxes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV</ENAMEX> light was also examined. Finally, our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were discussed in light of published literature
        regarding the possible survival of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in
        earthly environments.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and other spacefaring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> are
        required by treaty to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> and other non-earthly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planetary</ENAMEX> systems from contamination by earthly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microorganisms</ENAMEX>. From work reported here, it appears that
        environmentally robust endospores, if delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spacecraft</ENAMEX>, could survive for extended periods of time in
        the cold, dry, preserving environment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, despite the
        presence of strong oxidants in the soil.
      
      
        Results
        Under ambient environmental conditions, synthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) degraded some organic molecules mixed into
        sand. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> mg of ferrate removed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> mg
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4,6</NUMEX>-trinitrotoluene (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX>) from the reaction mixture
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However, a mixture of dodecane and hexadecane
        was not degraded in the ferrate(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>)-soil mixture (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The degradative activity toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> was dependent on
        the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. All the organic moieties were stable
        in the dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>-ferrate mixture.
        Results of spore survival over time in the control and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>)-enriched or permanganate-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>
        surrogate soils under simulated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> environmental
        conditions are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The endospores survived
        exposure to high levels of ferrate under the imposed
        conditions for the duration of the experiment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to six</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>). At the times of sampling, the surrogate soil
        suspensions contained the characteristic crimson color of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) or similar color of permanganate.
        After spreading on the agar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, the ferrate present in
        the inoculum was reduced over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> to give a
        characteristic brown oxyhydroxy polymer precipitate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> on the plate surface, indicating that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) was stable under the simulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> conditions
        and had been available as a potential biocide for the
        duration of the experiment. Spore survival was similarly
        high in a surrogate soil containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">permanganate</ENAMEX> in place
        of ferrate. An important observation relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>
        environment was that transient exposure of spores to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> FeO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in the presence of liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was
        not sporocidal. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) is reduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>), a rapid
        process, it becomes non-toxic to the spores.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spores</ENAMEX> placed into a dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">permanganate</ENAMEX>-enriched surrogate
        soil and exposed within a column to a sterilizing flux of
        UV light at the column surface were killed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only the</TIMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 mm</NUMEX> of the column (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This was in the
        presence of air and at a temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) is a very strong oxidizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and will
        readily oxidize many organic molecules in aqueous solution
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . High oxidation power selectivity and
        by-production of non-toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) make potassium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) an environmentally friendly oxidant for removal
        of industrial contaminants from natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . We
        confirmed this degradative activity of ferrate using
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4,6</NUMEX>-trinitrotoluene (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX>), though a mixture of dodecane
        and hexadecane, as might be found within microbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX>, was not degraded by ferrate(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) (Figures 1and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) is known to be highly active in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biocide</ENAMEX>. For example, the kinetics of inactivation of a
        bacteriophage by potassium ferrate was studied with the
        F-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-coliphage Q beta. Inactivation in phosphate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 6, 7</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ferrate</ENAMEX> was effective
        and could be described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hom's</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The
        effectiveness of ferrate(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) in wastewater treatment has
        been studied, and it exhibits a strong bactericidal effect
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both coliforms</TIMEX> and total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . However, the
        conditions used in those prior experiments with ferrate(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>)
        do not at all mimic the conditions that might be
        encountered on the surface or in the subsurface of much of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, where there is thought to be essentially no available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , there is a highly oxidized atmosphere of
        mostly CO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and average temperatures are very
        low (typically <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-60</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C</TIMEX>, but sometimes reaching
        temperatures near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">0°C</ENAMEX> in areas of sunlight). These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>-like conditions were used in the experiments reported
        here.
        Certainly these conditions did not exactly duplicate the
        Martian atmosphere, which would have required use of a
        vacuum chamber. The pressure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> used was much higher than on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>.
        However, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is unreactive, the higher pressure
        should not have significantly affected the results. It is
        of course possible that at very low CO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> pressures endospores might be more
        sensitive to their environmental conditions than at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        atmosphere. This experiment will require a more
        sophisticated apparatus than is presently available to us,
        though we hope to obtain such equipment soon in order to
        further examine this question.
        It is likely that liquid water exists at least
        transiently on the surface of some locations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        . Because of the high reactivity of ferrate with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
        especially under alkaline conditions, it is likely that
        these locations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> contain iron mostly in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-toxic Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>)-oxyhydroxide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Also, endospores were
        not killed by transient exposure to ferrate in the presence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at room temperature. Thus, the transient
        occurrence of liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the soils of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> is
        insufficient reason to reject the general conclusion that
        if ferrate is present in the soils of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, it probably is 
        
          not 
         a sporocidal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. In locations where other forms of
        iron dominate, spores would be even more stable. However,
        additional experiments looking at spore survival that
        involve additions of small amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> w/w)
        to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> surrogate, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ferrate-enriched</ENAMEX> soil, with brief
        fluxes of temperature between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">about +5°C</NUMEX> would be
        useful to further address this question.
        Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> light is a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biocide</ENAMEX> and is present at
        high levels on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> surface, beneath the surface or
        under objects such as rocks, even the natural high flux of
        ultraviolet radiation on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> will likely be greatly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attenuated</ENAMEX>. We tested this hypothesis, confirming that
        spores are protected from the UV flux, even in the presence
        of a strong soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidant</ENAMEX> (permanganate), by a few mm of
        soil cover. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV</ENAMEX> light, provided by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury vapor lamp</ENAMEX>,
        was not filtered to exactly duplicate its passage through
        the atmosphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, though this might be accomplished
        with the appropriate apparatus (e.g., an irradiated vacuum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>). The intervening <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> was normal air at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 21%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.03%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . This clearly did not filter enough
        of the lethal wavelengths (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">254</NUMEX> nm) to significantly
        affect the strongly sporocidal quality of the light. On
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, however, the thinner atmosphere might allow better
        passage of other shorter lethal wavelengths (e.g., around
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">200 nm</TIMEX>) that might be filtered to some extent under the
        conditions used here. However, the likely effect of the
        difference in light wavelength filtration on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> 
        versus the experiments described here
        would be the ultimate soil cover depth needed to protect
        spores from UV damage, and this difference is likely not to
        be very large (less than an order of magnitude). Also, some
        endospores are considerably more UV-resistant than those we
        employed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , and substitution of such spores likely
        would have changed the results (survival vs. depth) to some
        degree. The important observation is the demonstrated
        protective effect of soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>.
        Earthly life forms can produce dormancy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that
        are highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions,
        including the presence of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidants</ENAMEX> and ionizing
        radiation, conditions that are thought to occur on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>.
        Bacterial endospores are a prime example of resistant
        dormancy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and recent research indicates that
        such dormant forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> can survive for even
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, under appropriate conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cano</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borucki</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] revived a bacterial spore from the abdominal
        contents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extinct bees</ENAMEX> preserved for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 to 40 million</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in buried <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dominican amber</ENAMEX> and cultured and identified
        it. Greenblatt, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] reported successful culture
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lebanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lode</ENAMEX>) amber dated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>. Vreeland, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] reported the
        isolation and growth of a previously unrecognized
        spore-forming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> (a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bacillus species</ENAMEX>, designated <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-9-3</ENAMEX>)
        from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine inclusion</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 250 million-year-old</TIMEX> salt
        crystal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Permian Salado Formation</ENAMEX>. Due to the
        difficulty in absolutely excluding modern contamination as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of these isolates, these reports have been
        controversial. However, to date these claims have not been
        invalidated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Thus, even studies of earthly systems
        indicate that under environmental conditions possibly less
        life preserving than those encountered on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, dormant
        life forms may have survived on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> for very long
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>, even of geological time scales. The most important
        factor for such survival appears to be desiccation, a
        defining characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amber</ENAMEX>, earthly brines, and much
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> environment. Though there apparently is water
        in the soil of the polar regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars Odyssey</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> observations), it is thought to be present as ice
        and probably is not biologically available.
        Little work has been done in the study of microbial
        survival in the extraterrestrial environment. Horneck, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] did observe survival of a significant fraction
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis spores</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of exposure to the space environment on board the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> Retrievable Carrier (EURECA). They exposed spores
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> to space for about
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIOPAN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> onboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Earth-orbiting FOTON</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX>.
        The spores were exposed under a variety of conditions: in
        dry layers without any protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>; mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>,
        red sandstone, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian analogue</ENAMEX> soil, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meteorite powder</ENAMEX>;
        or in "artificial meteorites" (cubes filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> and
        spores in naturally occurring concentrations). Unprotected
        spores in layers open to space or behind a quartz window
        were completely or nearly completely inactivated, and
        similarly low survival was obtained behind a thin layer of
        clay acting as an optical filter. Survival was increased by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more orders of magnitude when the spores in the dry
        layer were directly mixed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meteorites</ENAMEX>. Up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> survival was reached in soil
        mixtures with spores comparable to the natural soil to
        spore ratio. These data confirm the deleterious effects of
        extraterrestrial solar UV radiation but also confirm that
        thin layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, or meteorite can successfully
        shield spores from UV damage if they are in direct contact
        with the spores.
        Mileikowsky, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] considered the probability of
        natural transfer of viable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> in
        meteoroids ejected from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> during the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> to
        the present and during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ma</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>. They
        used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HZETRN</ENAMEX> transport code to calculate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probabilities</ENAMEX>, examining many variables potentially
        affecting microbe survival. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> modeled used the
        environmentally robust bacteria 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> (spore-former) and 
        Deinococcus radiodurans (highly
        radiation resistant). Their modeling suggested that if
        microbes existed or exist on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, viable transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>
        is not only possible but also highly probable, due to these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microbes</ENAMEX>' impressive resistance to the hazards of space
        transfer and to the dense traffic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martian</ENAMEX> meteorites
        that have fallen to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> since the dawn of our planetary
        system.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Here the hypothesis was examined that if the surface
        soil of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> contains significant amounts of ferrate(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>),
        it will be self-sterilizing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dried</ENAMEX>, but living dormant
        endospores of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> were incubated in a
        Mars surrogate soil containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> by weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> FeO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . Incubation conditions similar to
        those now on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> (dry, cold, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -enriched atmosphere) were used. Under
        these conditions the endospores were not immediately killed
        but in fact were resistant to inactivation by the
        ferrate-enriched or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">permanganate-enriched</ENAMEX> soil (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Though some delay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> formation compared to controls
        was observed upon addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> prior to plate
        counting, the 
        Bacillus spores survived both storage
        in a ferrate-rich soil and the brief simultaneous presence
        of ferrate and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> during analysis. This simple
        experiment indicates that ferrate does not necessarily
        provide an environment that is self-sterilizing on
        non-geological time scale.
        It is possible that a thin coating of ferric hydroxide
        on the surface of our ferrate crystals might have afforded
        some protection to the spores from ferrate exposure since
        small traces of water vapor might still have been present
        despite our attempt to exclude it. However, this coating
        would likely be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few angstroms</NUMEX> thick (ferrate was of
        very high purity at > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> pure) and probably was
        insignificant compared to the overall amount of ferrate
        present. This is supported by the observation that the
        presence of an alternative strong oxidant that does not
        have the potential for such a coating (permanganate
        crystals at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> w/w final concentration) also did not kill
        the endospores supports this (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        The finding that organic molecules were degraded only
        after the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to the soil also supports the
        inactivity of ferrate under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> conditions. Significant
        amounts of liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are thus required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ferrate</TIMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degradative</ENAMEX> or biocidal activities. Ferrate must be in
        solution in order to act as an oxidant. Assuming the soil
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> by weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, mostly in the
        form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] , complete thawing would fail
        to approach the slurry conditions used here to accomplish
        oxidation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mg surrogate soil + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mg liquid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX>). Even these saturated conditions did not promote the
        oxidation of hydrocarbons. The traces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~200 ppm</NUMEX>)
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Martian</ENAMEX> atmosphere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] might also form thin
        layers of rust on soil particles there, making the
        surrogate soil system used here even more like the proposed
        ferrate-enriched soil of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. The data (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) show
        that below the immediate surface, high fluxes of UV
        radiation in the presence of strong oxidants are attenuated
        and are not sporocidal.
        If dormancy structures similar to endospores were
        produced at some point by life forms on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, data reported
        here suggest they could still be present and viable. This
        might actually be demonstrated, as in the surrogate soil
        experiments described here, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>.
        Rejuvenation experiments could be performed remotely 
        in situ or in a contained laboratory
        setting after return of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such
        experiment in fact was essentially performed in the
        original biology experiments aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viking</ENAMEX>, though the
        results were inconclusive. The experiments need to be
        repeated, with modifications based on all we have learned
        in the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. There are now improved ways to
        monitor microbial signatures and metabolic processes that
        are indicative of life in soil [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . The fact that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spores</ENAMEX> appear to survive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many decades</TIMEX> and perhaps
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in earthly systems further
        supports the possibility for survival of similar life forms
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. The conditions on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> might actually be even more
        conducive than those on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> for long-term survival of
        such living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> because of the unique combination of
        cold, dehydration, lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, and protection from
        direct UV exposure.
        In the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX> experiments where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        searched for organic compounds in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] ,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> samples were examined (one surface and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> subsurface
        sample from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> locations).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gas</ENAMEX>-chromatography/mass-spectrometry at a sensitivity of
        parts per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX> (ppb) for some compounds yielded negative
        results. Presumably, if microorganisms had been present,
        organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> would have been detected. However, these
        results suffer from the limitations of all negative
        results. They cannot prove the absence of life since there
        was the inherent limitation of analytical sensitivity, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> locations close to the landing site on the Martian
        surface were examined. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> endospore weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -13g</TIMEX>. Assuming there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such spore per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil, and one could detect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of the organic
        matter in that spore, this would require an analytical
        sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> ppb. In reality the organic matter in a
        cell or spore contains many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of compounds with few
        classes representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a few</NUMEX> percent of the total,
        and considerably less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> efficiency in extraction
        and detection is possible. Thus the actual sensitivity
        required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX> to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 spore / g</ENAMEX> of soil would
        have been in the ppt range. Detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1000 spores / g</ENAMEX>
        would have required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX> ppb sensitivity. These
        requirements are well below the sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/MS</ENAMEX>
        used aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viking</ENAMEX>. However, techniques based on growing of
        cells from spores or measuring their physiological activity
        after germination, not performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viking</ENAMEX>, could provide a
        sensitivity as low as a few spores / g of soil [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
        It has been suggested that the oxidizing nature of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil is due to the photochemical reactions that
        create hydrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peroxide</ENAMEX> and superoxides in the surface
        soil. Using data obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Viking</ENAMEX> gas exchange
        experiment and assuming that all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> came from H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , the concentration range of hydrogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxide</ENAMEX> has been calculated to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-250 ppm</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Some
        soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> survive at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000 ppm</NUMEX> of H
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that presence of
        this peroxide alone on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> surface would not make the soil
        "self-sterilizing."
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> of course has been dry and cold for a very long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, and it is not possible to run experiments such as
        ours over geologic time scales. It may be that an oxidant
        like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) might be biocidal over periods lasting
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, even in the dry cold-storage environment
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. However, we conclude that the occurrence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> soils, if present, will not necessarily
        promote immediate self-sterilization of the soils.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and other spacefaring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> are
        required by treaty to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> and other non-earthly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planetary</ENAMEX> systems from contamination by earthly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microorganisms</ENAMEX>. Bacterial endospores that are particularly
        resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as disinfectants (e.g.,
        vapor-phase hydrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peroxide</ENAMEX>), extreme desiccation, and
        even gamma radiation are the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contaminants</ENAMEX> found

        assembly clean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> include
        cultivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus licheniformis</ENAMEX>, B. pumilus, B.
        cereus , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. circulans</ENAMEX> , as well as other
        strains that have not yet been cultivated but can be
        observed through their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA 16S</ENAMEX> rDNA fingerprints. From work
        reported here it appears that such robust spores, if
        delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spacecraft</ENAMEX>, could survive for
        extended, if not indefinite, periods of time in the cold,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dry</ENAMEX>, preserving environment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, despite the presence
        of strong oxidants in the soil. This might compromise later
        experiments aimed at detecting life on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Red Planet</ENAMEX>,
        and/or influence its future ecology over geologic time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX>.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> FeO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> was prepared and stored (dry)
          according to the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . Its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purity</ENAMEX> and state of oxidation was confirmed by an
          oxidimetric titration using arsenite-cerate method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
          . This method measures only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>), leaving any
          ferric ions in the preparation unreduced. The fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> FeO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> pure.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sets of reaction mixtures were prepared. Treatment
          mixtures contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mg of pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silica sand</ENAMEX> as a soil
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surrogate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5</NUMEX> mg <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> FeO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , and different amounts of the
          nitrated organic compound <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4,6</NUMEX>-trinitrotoluene (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX>);
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 15</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 mg</NUMEX>. A control set
          contained only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> and sand. All experiments were
          prepared using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> replicates. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were twice
          mixed by vortexing and centrifuged for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 min at 16 kG</NUMEX> in
          order to remove reagents from walls of vials. There was
          no detectable reaction at this step. To every vial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ul
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deionized water</ENAMEX> were added. Reactants were mixed,
          centrifuged, and incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> at room
          temperature. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> was added;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40-50</NUMEX> mg of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfate</ENAMEX> were later added to
          remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the mixture. After vortexing, the
          reaction mixture was centrifuged for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 min at 16 kG</NUMEX>.
          Supernatant was diluted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20×</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> for electrospray

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC/MS</ENAMEX> was used for quantitative measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> and
          hydrocarbon concentrations in soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX>. Sample (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ul</ENAMEX>) was injected into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HP 7683 series</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injector</ENAMEX> (split-less injection). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass spectrometer</ENAMEX>'s
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5989A</ENAMEX>) scan range was from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 to 800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da</ENAMEX>.
          Temperature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was held at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250°C</TIMEX> and of the
          quadropole at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">120°C</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ion source</ENAMEX> was set on positive
          electron impact ionization mode. The temperature of the
          injector on the gas chromatograph (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard 5890</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">series II</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS interface</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">280°C</TIMEX>. For

          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.25 mm × 1.25 μm</NUMEX>). The initial oven temperature was
          100°C, held for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute</TIMEX>. This was increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10°C</NUMEX> per min
          until the final temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300°C</TIMEX>, which was held for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perfluorotributylamine</ENAMEX> was used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX>-tuning

          Preparation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> surrogate soil
          Pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silica sand</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>) was dried by heating
          overnight at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">110°C</TIMEX> and then stored in desiccators
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calcium chloride</ENAMEX>. Potassium ferrate was added
          (see below) to a level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w/w</ENAMEX>) and mixed thoroughly
          into the sand to form a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> surrogate soil. The soil was
          used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbiological</ENAMEX> experiments as soon as possible
          after preparation (always less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          soil was prepared similarly, substituting KMnO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> FeO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> soil contained only
          sand.
        
        
          Preparation of bacterial cells and
          endospores
          Our own laboratory strain of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> was grown in a
          simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> extract-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX> through late logarithmic
          phase of growth and allowed to sporulate. The spores were
          collected by centrifugation, washed twice with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mL of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sterile water</ENAMEX>, freeze dried, and stored under desiccation
          until used. The bacterial strain used is a typical 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> strain and is
          available from the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> upon request.
        
        
          Exposure of cells and spores to a simulated Martian
          soil environment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbiological</ENAMEX> experiments were performed, with data
          points collected in triplicate, using small microcosms
          comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50mL serum</NUMEX> bottles. Surrogate soil (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/microcosm</ENAMEX>) and spores (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2 × 10 4per gram</NUMEX> of soil)
          were placed together into the bottles. To ensure complete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixing</ENAMEX> and uniform exposure of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> or spores to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferrate</ENAMEX> component of the soil, they were first suspended
          in a small amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sterile water</ENAMEX>. This was thoroughly
          mixed into the sand fraction of the surrogate soil, which
          was then lyophilized. The ferrate component of the
          surrogate soil was next thoroughly mixed into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microbe-enriched</ENAMEX>, dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> within a sterile laminar-flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hood</ENAMEX>, and the bottles were flushed with pure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and sealed with sterile stoppers and
          crimp seals. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was provided from a bottle of
          reagent-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> purity) as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compressed gas</ENAMEX> and was scrubbed to remove traces of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The microcosms were sparged with
          multiple volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> under normal atmospheric
          pressure. The sealed microcosms were immediately placed
          in a freezer at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20°C</TIMEX>. Periodically, triplicate bottles
          were removed and opened for analysis. A small amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 ml</NUMEX>) was added and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> ml of the suspension was
          quickly removed using an aseptic technique and spread
          onto a plate of nutrient agar (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Difco</ENAMEX>). The plates were
          incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C and then</TIMEX> examined periodically for
          outgrowth of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis colonies</ENAMEX>. Plates
          were inoculated in triplicate and colony-forming units
          determined after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> and again after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX>. Controls without ferrate were run
          simultaneously. Similar experiments were performed after
          replacing ferrate with an equal amount of potassium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permanganate</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Protection of spores in dry soil from killing by
          surface UV irradiation in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          permanganate
          A surrogate soil containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> (by weight)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permanganate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> was inoculated with spores of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> and placed within
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forma Scientific UV</ENAMEX>-illuminated laminar-flow hood under
          its full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> illumination and in the presence of air for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 hours</TIMEX>. The open surface of the microcosm was placed
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> cm from the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-watt</NUMEX> mercury vapor light
          source. The hood is calibrated annually for
          effectiveness, and under these conditions will produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          8per <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cm</ENAMEX> 2spore kill on a metal surface within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>.
          Then exposure samples were removed progressively from the
          surface in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mm increments and plate counts performed for
          surviving spores. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> represent counts from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. Error bars show <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard deviation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Untreated</ENAMEX> controls taken at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time 0</TIMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2.0</NUMEX> ×
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 4spores</NUMEX> in a similar size sample.
