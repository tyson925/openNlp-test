        Involvement of the spleen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> that results in
        splenomegaly renders this organ prone to complications such
        as rupture [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In areas where <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is endemic,
        spontaneous rupture of spleen is uncommon. Because of
        increased travel to endemic areas and resistance to
        anti-malarial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is a major medical
        problem, which is becoming increasingly important to
        surgeons worldwide. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s and 1990s</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>,
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> number of diagnosed cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> rose by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> to fourfold that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding decade</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>].
        We report <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases of spontaneous rupture of malarial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spleen</ENAMEX> treated with splenectomy.
      
      
        Case reports
        
          Case 1
          A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> presented at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> with sudden
          onset of upper abdominal pain, followed by palpitations
          and fainting. He had been taking chloroquine. In the
          emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> he was hypotensive and had pain in
          the left hypochondrium. Ultrasound showed an enlarged,
          ruptured spleen and free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the abdomen. There was
          free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1500 cm 2</ENAMEX>) in the peritoneal cavity, and a
          friable, enlarged, ruptured spleen (grade III) was found
          and removed. Pathological examination revealed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spleen</ENAMEX> weighed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">950</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> and measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 × 7 cm</NUMEX>. Gross
          examination showed the spleen to be dark grey, with
          capsular tear and subcapsular haematoma on the medial
          side. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microscopy</ENAMEX> revealed dilatation of sinuses,
          increased pigmentation and elevated concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>. Thick and thin films revealed the presence
          of 
          Plasmodium vivax . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
          much improved, was discharged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 days</TIMEX> after the
          operation.
        
        
          Case 2
          A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was receiving treatment for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal ulcer</ENAMEX> in the gastroenterology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. He was
          also receiving chloroquine for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> of
          hospitalization he had high-grade fever and immediately
          became hypotensive, and had abdominal pain. We performed
          abdominal paracentesis, which demonstrated free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in
          the peritoneal cavity. Explorative laparotomy revealed
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one</TIMEX> litre of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the peritoneal cavity
          and an enlarged spleen, measuring almost double its
          normal size with a tear on the inferior surface (grade
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>). Splenectomy was performed. The spleen was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1050</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> and
          measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 × 8 cm</NUMEX>. Gross examination showed grayish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brown</ENAMEX> discoloured spleen with capsular tears at a few
          places. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microscopy</ENAMEX> revealed congestion and dilatation of
          sinuses, and bleeding areas. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> vivax was identified by thick
          film. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was discharged well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 days</TIMEX> after the
          operation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Malaria parasites</ENAMEX> have been with us throughout human
        history. They probably originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> (along with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>), and fossils of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> show that the vectors
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> have existed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 30 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. 
        Plasmodium parasites are highly
        specific, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> as the only vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and 
        Anopheles <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> as the vectors.
        This specificity of the parasites also indicates a long and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adaptive</ENAMEX> relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Despite initial success, there was complete failure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">eradicate malaria</ENAMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> because of a number of
        factors. Although technical difficulties such as vector and
        parasite drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> have played a part, failure in
        this endeavour was probably due to social and political
        factors that prevented efficient application of control
        measures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> control operation was criticized
        for being too much like a military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, and the lack
        of explanation given to local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> meant that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> measures received little support, or even
        opposition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Accurate information on the global
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is difficult to obtain because
        reporting is particularly poor in areas that are known to
        be highly endemic. The global incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is
        estimated to be nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">120 million</NUMEX> clinical cases each
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 300 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> carrying the parasite.
        The vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> deaths occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
        Estimates vary greatly; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]
        quoted a figure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800 000</NUMEX> deaths/year in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Malaria</ENAMEX> is generally endemic in the tropics, with
        extensions into subtropic regions. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Malaria</ENAMEX> in travellers
        who arrive by air is now an important cause of death in
        nonmalarious areas [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], and this is not helped by
        ignorance or indifference of travellers to prophylactic
        measures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaria</ENAMEX> has long been among the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southeast Anatolia</ENAMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">676</NUMEX> cases were diagnosed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Diyarbakir</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> had
        the highest incidence (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4168</NUMEX> cases), followed by SanliUrfa
        city (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3578</NUMEX> cases). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southeast Anatolia region</ENAMEX> is in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upper Mesopotamia</ENAMEX>, covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diyarbakir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SanliUrfa</ENAMEX>,
        GaziAntep, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adiyaman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Batman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mardin, Siirt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirnak</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaria</ENAMEX> was especially common during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994 and 1995</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">345 and 82 094</NUMEX> cases being diagnosed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these years</TIMEX>,
        respectively. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> the number of new cases
        decreased, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 842</NUMEX> cases being encountered (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Proquanil with chloroquine have been advised as the best
        prophylactic regimen for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> travelling to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">southeast Anatolia</ENAMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between March</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is well described in
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is the most common [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. Other such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> include infectious mononucleosis,
        splenic neoplasms and haematological malignancies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. The incidence of rupture of the spleen in malaria
        is poorly defined. Comparisons of cases that occur in the
        setting of natural or induced infection have most
        frequently been employed to investigate this issue. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural</ENAMEX>
        infection is that acquired via a mosquito bite or
        transpla-centally. Induced infection is that obtained
        through blood transfusion, sharing of needles, laboratory
        accidents and experimental or therapeutic inoculation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> cases of malarial splenic rupture have been
        reported since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of the
        reports can the incidence be calculated. Rates of splenic
        rupture in naturally occurring infection ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rupture/5870</ENAMEX> total cases of infection) to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 rupture/51</NUMEX>
        total cases of infection) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. The only series of
        splenic ruptures in induced infections reported an
        incidence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 ruptures/715</NUMEX> total cases of infection)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. That <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 15</NUMEX> cases have been reported since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>
        suggests under-reporting or under-diagnosis, especially for
        those cases of splenic rupture in the setting of naturally
        acquired infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>].
        Splenic enlargement is very common in malarious areas of
        the world. It is found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        When a palpable spleen is present, it is generally
        appreciated within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-4days</TIMEX> of the onset of symptoms. If
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains untreated, the spleen can grow. This
        results in greater average spleen size in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as
        the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> increases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> vivax has been the species most
        closely associated with rupture of the spleen in both
        naturally acquired and induced infections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Among
        cases reported after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> were due to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> vivax (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases were induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> were naturally acquired infections).
        Both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> described above had 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> vivax infection. Spontaneous
        rupture of the spleen occurs almost exclusively during
        acute infection, and usually during the primary attack [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>].
        The exact mechanism of spleen rupture is not known.
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mechanisms have been implicated in the
        process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these mechanisms is increase in
        intrasplenic tension that is due to cellular hyperplasia
        and engorgement. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the spleen may be compressed by
        the abdominal musculature during physiological activities
        such as sneezing, coughing, defecation, and sitting up or
        turning in bed. Finally, vascular occlusion due to reticule
        endothelial hyperplasia, resulting in thrombosis and
        infarction, may be involved. This leads to interstitial and
        subcapsular haemorrhage and stripping of the capsule, which
        lead to further subcapsular haemorrhage. The distended
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capsule</ENAMEX> finally gives way.
        Pathological findings in spontaneous rupture of the
        spleen include gross and microscopic changes. On gross
        examination, acutely malarial spleen is dark red because of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">congestion</ENAMEX>, hyperaemia and deposition of haemozoin (a
        malarial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX>). The capsule is thin and friable. Chronic
        malarial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spleen</ENAMEX> tends to be dark grey, with increased
        density of connective tissue and fibrosis, resulting in a
        heavy, often massively enlarged organ with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> or hard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capsule</ENAMEX>. In addition, disruption of the spleen capsule and
        single or multiple tears in the underlying parenchyma may
        be found. Tears may be small or large (grades <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-IV</ENAMEX>) and may
        be present on any surface. In both of the cases described
        above, the spleen was massively enlarged.
        Microscopic examination demonstrated haemozoin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasitized</ENAMEX> and uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">erythrocytes</ENAMEX>, and a massive
        proliferation of macrophages throughout the capillaries,
        venous sinuses and pulp spaces. There is congestion and
        dilatation of sinuses and scattered thrombosis, with focal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> in capillaries and splenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulp</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Splenectomy</ENAMEX> is accepted as the treatment of choice in
        cases of spontaneous rupture of the spleen. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> described since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> (including those described
        above), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> underwent surgical procedures, all of
        which were splenectomies. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is
        not endemic, improved surgical techniques and supportive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, in addition to increased preoperative and
        postoperative risk of splenectomy, have led to attempted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonoperative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of splenic rupture in many cases of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">penetrating</ENAMEX> and blunt trauma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonoperative</ENAMEX> management
        consists of observation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-14 days</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
        strict bed rest, and administration of fluid and blood as
        needed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. In areas in which <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is endemic, there
        is growing evidence to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        spontaneous rupture of malarial spleen without splenectomy
        should be attempted. A conservative strategy is also
        reasonable in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who travel frequently to malarious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Splenectomy</ENAMEX> should be reserved for those patients
        with severe rupture or those with continued or recurrent
        bleeding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Conclusion
        Changes in the structure of the spleen during the course
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> can result in asymptomatic enlargement or
        complications such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haematoma</ENAMEX> formation and rupture.
        Primary exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and infection with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> vivax appear to be important
        factors in spontaneous rupture of the spleen. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Malaria</ENAMEX> is
        still important in the southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>.
        Prophylactic measures should be taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> who
        travel to this region, especially those who do so during
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
