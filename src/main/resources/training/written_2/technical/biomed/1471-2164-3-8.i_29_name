        Homologous DNA recombination is a fundamental process in
        the biochemistry of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair and replication, which
        contributes to the generation of the genetic diversity
        critical for natural selection. An important step in the
        recombination process is the pairing of homologous
        double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of DNA
        strands between the paired molecules. Experimental studies
        have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the archetypal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        recombinases are central to this reaction in all extant
        forms of life [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        Studies in 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> have shown that,
        although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecA</ENAMEX> is the principle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involved in pairing
        and strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, that have a much
        more restrictive phyletic distribution, can also promote
        similar reactions in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecA</ENAMEX> dependent or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecA</ENAMEX>-independent
        manner [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . These alternative or additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of
        homologous recombination include the well-characterized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prophage RecT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phage λ Redβ</ENAMEX> and phage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P22 ERF proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and vertebrates, the RAD52
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is involved in the pairing and strand exchange
        reaction and can promote recombination in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RAD51</TIMEX> (the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eukaryotic RecA</ENAMEX> homolog)-dependent or independent manner [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> works in conjunction with the
        RecE-nuclease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and was initially described in genetic
        studies on the complemention of mutations in the RecBCD
        pathway of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Biochemically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> has
        been shown to bind single-stranded (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ss</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA 3</ENAMEX>' overhang
        regions generated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecE</ENAMEX> nuclease, and promote strand
        exchange between homologous DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> by assisting the
        pairing of complementary single-stranded regions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        The reaction catalyzed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RecT/RecE</ENAMEX> system is similar
        to that described for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phage λ exonuclease</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exo/Redβ</ENAMEX>)
        and the single-strand annealing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Redβ</ENAMEX>. The
        similarity between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems is further extended by
        the observation that the RecT/E system can complement
        mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">λ exo</ENAMEX>/Redβ system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 12</NUMEX> ] . In
        eukaryotes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAD52 protein</ENAMEX> has been shown to exhibit
        properties similar to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Redβ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: it
        binds ssDNA and promotes strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> via the pairing of
        complementary single strands [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13</ENAMEX> ] . 
        In vitro studies on quaternary
        structures have shown that the single strand annealing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (SSAPs), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT, Redβ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAD52</ENAMEX>, form similar
        helical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>structures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . This has led to
        the proposal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT, Redβ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> and the eukaryotic RAD52
        function in an analogous fashion, and even are "structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX>" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        However, no sequence or secondary structural
        similarities have been noticed between different SSAPs and
        current understanding of their evolutionary history and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phyletic</ENAMEX> range remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>. Here, we describe the results
        of an in-depth sequence analysis of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
        delineate their evolutionary relationships and phyletic
        horizon in available genomes. We show that, in spite of the
        functional similarities, and the similar quaternary
        structures, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct superfamilies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX>, namely the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAD52</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX>, that appear to
        be evolutionarily unrelated to each other. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamilies</ENAMEX> show a wide distribution in viral and
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>, but appear to have originally evolved in
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA bacteriophages</ENAMEX>. Through an analysis of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contextual</ENAMEX> information provided by the predicted operons,
        in which the SSAPs occur, we predict several previously
        undetected functional connections of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which
        might shed new light on the corresponding DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">repair/recombination pathways.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> are evolutionarily related and define
          a widespread family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA recombination proteins</ENAMEX>
          Several lines of evidence, including genetic analyses,
          and similarities in biochemistry and quaternary
          structures, suggest that the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RecT</ENAMEX> and phage λ Redβ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are functionally equivalent as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of
          single-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> recombination [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 12</NUMEX> ] .
          However, no sequence similarity has been detected between
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> leaving their actual evolutionary
          relationships unresolved. In order to gain a better
          understanding of their functions and origins, we
          undertook a detailed sequence analysis of these two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> using iterative sequence profile searches with
          the PSI-BLAST program with a inclusion threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iterated</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX>. Such searches, with Redβ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from different lambdoid bacteriophages as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">queries</ENAMEX>, retrieved not only other obvious Redβ homologs,
          but also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. For example, searches
          initiated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> homolog, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PF161 protein</ENAMEX> (Genbank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi: 9836834</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids 1</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX>) from 
          Borrelia hermsii [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , detected
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli RecT protein</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          thiteration with significant expectation (e) values (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ×
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 -3</ENAMEX>). Subsequent iterations retrieved several more
          RecT-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Further,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transitive</ENAMEX> searches with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> detected in the
          above searches resulted in the identification of more
          divergent homologs, such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> termed the
          'enterohemolysin associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>' (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EHAP1</NUMEX>) from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and its orthologs in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An examination
          of the pairwise alignments generated by these searches
          showed that all these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> shared a characteristic
          set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, including two highly conserved aromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>termini, respectively, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          consecutive acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>. These
          observations strongly suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redβ</ENAMEX>, along
          with several other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, could be unified into a
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> superfamily with a core conserved domain
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX>.
          A multiple alignment of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the RecT/Redβ
          superfamily was generated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_coffee</ENAMEX> program
          followed by adjustments based on the PSI-BLAST search
          results. This alignment was used to predict their
          secondary structure using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPRED</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> methods;
          these predictions pointed to an α + β domain with a core
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> β-strands and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> α-helices (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Some of
          the strongest conservation is concentrated in the long
          helices, and the pattern includes some charged or polar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, suggesting that they are probably exposed and
          participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> and protein-DNA
          interactions that are typical of this superfamily
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">helices 2,3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The conserved, regularly
          spaced hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily
          are predicted to be buried, allowing these domains to
          assume a globular structure. Experimental studies have
          shown that the strand transfer reaction mediated by RecT
          and its binding to dsDNA are sensitive to Mg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2concentrations</ENAMEX> and it was proposed that the levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">free Mg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2could</ENAMEX> regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">RecT</ENAMEX> activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Similarly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> has been shown to promote single strand annealing in
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2-dependent</ENAMEX> manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In this context, the
          conservation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the
          majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this superfamily suggests that
          these might be involved in the coordination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mg</ENAMEX> +2and
          implies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal ion-dependent</ENAMEX> conformational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">switching</ENAMEX> is likely to be a generic feature of this
          family.
          Phylogenetic analyses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily
          using the least squares and maximum likelihood methods
          distinguished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, namely the
          RecT-like, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redβ</ENAMEX>-like and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EHAP1</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Previously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been known
          from very few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> has only been detected in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">λ</ENAMEX> and closely related phages. However, we showed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redβ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, such as 
          Borrelia hermsii, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella, Ureaplasma</ENAMEX>,
          Listeria, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptococcus</ENAMEX> pyogenes, Mesorhizobium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loti</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is predominantly seen in the
          low-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacillus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Streptococcus</ENAMEX>, Lactococcus
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Listeria</ENAMEX>, and their phages (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          Legionella pneumophila are the only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> γ-proteobacteria that possess this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          suggesting that they might have acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RecT</ENAMEX> via a
          relatively recent horizontal transfer from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The sporadic distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> and Redβ
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in bacterial genomes and their presence
          in phages suggest that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ultimately are of
          phage origin and have been co-opted by the bacterial DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">recombination/</ENAMEX>repair systems. Consistent with this,
          practically all the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          appear to belong to prophages or their remnants, as they
          are mostly in the neighborhood of what appear to be
          clearly phage-derived genes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">EHAP1</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
          extremely divergent and represented thus far only in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and the closely related 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX>. Practically all members
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily are single-domain proteins
          showing extended similarity to each other throughout
          their globular regions. The only exceptions are the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli EHAP1</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PF161</TIMEX> protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in the 
          Borrelia hermsii circular plasmid,
          which are fused to C-terminal fragments of the ERF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (see below).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> defines a superfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> that are
          evolutionarily distinct from the RecT/Redβ super
          family
          The ERF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phage P22</ENAMEX> is involved in the
          circularization of the linear dsDNA phage genome upon
          entry into the host cell [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Experimental
          studies have shown that, mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> are
          complemented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> and that 
          in vitro ERF adopts quaternary
          structures analogous to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 17 24</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . However, in the comprehensive analysis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily no statistically significant
          similarity could be detected between these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
          the ERF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. To explore the evolutionary affinities
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> domains, we carried out a sequence profile
          analysis as described above for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecT</ENAMEX> case using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitive</ENAMEX> PSI-BLAST analysis. As a result of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">searches</ENAMEX>, homologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> encoded in several bacterial
          and phage genomes from diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxa</ENAMEX> were identified. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> generated in these searches consistently
          pointed to a region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 150</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that
          is conserved in all these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, with a characteristic
          motif of the form: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GuXXoYhp</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YXhXXhh</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> is
          glycine, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-tyrosine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> is a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, h-hydrophobic,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> is a polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, o is an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol residue</ENAMEX>, + is a
          basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> is any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This
          suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> was the prototype of a family of
          conserved bacterial domains.
          Secondary structure prediction based on the multiple
          alignment of the ERF domain suggests a globular α + β
          fold with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> helices and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four strands</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The above-mentioned motif that is typical of this
          family is associated with helix <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of this domain; given
          the presence of conserved basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, it may be
          critical for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding and strand-transfer activity of
          the ERF-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Additionally, in the loop between
          helices <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX> of the ERF domain there is a universally
          conserved acidic motif of the form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DXD</ENAMEX>. Analogous to the
          RecT superfamily, this acidic dyad might coordinate a
          divalent cation and undergo a conformational change
          dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>-binding. However, the average size of
          the core domains, the patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved residues</ENAMEX>, and
          the predicted secondary structures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> domains show no correspondence to each other,
          implying that there is no direct evolutionary link
          between these protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> homologs are encoded by the genomes of several
          temperate phages of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
          γ-proteobacteria; additionally, we detected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          this superfamily in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Listeria</ENAMEX> and in all the circular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> and one linear plasmid of 
          Borrelia burgdorferi (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Thus, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
          likely to have emerged in the temperate phages, and was
          disseminated to the 
          Borrelia circular plasmids and some
          bacterial genomes via prophages.
        
        
          Detection of bacterial homologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAD52</ENAMEX> and
          identification of an aberrant HhH domain in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast protein RAD52</ENAMEX> and its paralog RAD59
          define a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> thus far represented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX>, vertebrates and the early-branching ameboid
          eukaryote, 
          Entamoeba histolytica. Rad52
          functions in conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecA</ENAMEX> ortholog, the
          RAD51 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recombinase</ENAMEX> in double-strand break repair and
          meiotic recombination [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . RAD52 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> ssDNA during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> and also shows a quaternary organization
          similar to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 26</NUMEX> ] .
          However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> showed no detectable
          sequence similarity with either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> or the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Sequence searches initiated with
          the conserved globular region of the eukaryotic RAD52
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> readily detected their homologs from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and, at convergence, also retrieved from the
          database certain bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as DR0423 from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deinococcus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAC1936</ENAMEX> from 
          Clostridium respectively, with
          border-like statistical significance (e <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~ .05</NUMEX>). These
          bacterial proteins form a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that is
          additionally represented in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella paratyphi A</ENAMEX>, the
          temperate bacteriophage <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">u136</NUMEX> of 
          Lactococcus lactis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ORF252</NUMEX>-encoded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) and a Shiga <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-converting phage from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . Iterative profile
          searches initiated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">CAC1936</NUMEX> from 
          Clostridium acetobutylicum and its 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> paratyphi A ortholog
          correspondingly retrieved 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAD52</ENAMEX> and its
          eukaryotic homologs, with borderline e-values at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convergence</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.043</NUMEX>). The alignment between these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterial proteins</ENAMEX> and the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rad52</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-linear throughout the entire length of their shared
          globular <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibbs</ENAMEX> sampling procedure detected
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> motifs of greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, with a
          probability of chance occurrence in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -18</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In addition to the similar
          conservation pattern, separate secondary structure
          predictions for both the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAD52</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
          their potential bacterial homologs showed a complete
          concordance of the predicted structural elements between
          RAD52 and the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, strongly suggesting
          that they all belong to a single homologous superfamily
          (hereinafter the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX> superfamily).
          The secondary structure predictions showed that the
          Rad52 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">superfamily proteins</ENAMEX> adopt a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interspersed α</ENAMEX>-helices and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-strands</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Additionally, fold predictions using 3DPSSM
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0085</NUMEX>, corresponding to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> confidence in the
          prediction) and the hybrid fold method (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-score = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.5</NUMEX>)
          predicted the presence of a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Helix-hairpin-Helix</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HhH</ENAMEX>) fold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX> superfamily. The HhH
          domain is a small nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">module</ENAMEX> comprised
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">helices</ENAMEX> joined by a central loop (hairpin), which
          functions as the DNA-binding moiety of numerous repair
          and recombination <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">HhH</ENAMEX> modules
          are predicted in the core conserved domain of the RAD52
          family, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> bounded by the predicted helices <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one bounded by helices <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Although these predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HhH</ENAMEX> modules are very
          divergent in sequence from the typical versions, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hairpin</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HhH</ENAMEX> modules of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX> family proteins
          is bounded by small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, typically glycine; this
          conforms to the signature motif characteristic of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classical HhH</ENAMEX> modules [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . However, in the case of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX> superfamily the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HhH</ENAMEX> modules appear to
          have been welded into a large globular superstructure
          that maintained its evolutionary distinctness over time.
          The conservation pattern and predicted structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX> superfamily are distinct from those
          predicted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamilies (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 5</ENAMEX>), supporting the lack of a direct evolutionary
          relationship between these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX> superfamily shows a sporadic phyletic
          distribution, and even in the crown<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> eukaryotes,
          might have been secondarily lost in certain lineages,
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, nematodes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>. The sporadic
          distribution of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> among phylogenetically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">distant bacteria</ENAMEX>, along with its presence in several
          prophages, suggests that, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> and ERF
          superfamilies, at least the bacterial RAD52-proteins
          might be of predominantly phage origin. The core of the
          eukaryotic recombination system appears to have been
          inherited from the system present in the common ancestor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> with the archaea [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAD52</ENAMEX> is thus
          far absent in all archaeal genomes and is restricted to a
          single orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the eukaryotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Thus,
          it appears plausible that eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAD52</ENAMEX> was ultimately
          derived through lateral transfer either from a bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> or directly from a viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, at a point at
          least predating the divergence of the crown group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entamoeba</ENAMEX>. 
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contextual</ENAMEX> information from gene neighborhoods
          provides details regarding functional interactions of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> recombination pathways
          The clustering of functionally related genes in
          prokaryotic genomes into co-transcribed and co-regulated
          units, operons, often allows functional assignments
          through the principle of 'guilt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>' [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . Generally, genes whose products physically
          interact to form a complex or are involved in successive
          steps in a biochemical pathway form operons that are
          conserved over large evolutionary distances [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . On
          previous occasions, we have used gene neighborhoods or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operons</ENAMEX> to predict novel DNA repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and their
          components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Accordingly, a similar approach was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX>,
          Rad52), to shed light on their functional links.
          Notably, the genes encoding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> evolutionarily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinct SSAPs</ENAMEX> co-occurred with similar sets of DNA
          repair/recombination-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 2, 4</ENAMEX>). In at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, each of them was found adjacent to the
          gene for the single-strand-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (SSB), an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OB</ENAMEX>-fold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that binds ssDNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 2, 4</ENAMEX>). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> ties in with the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> in
          single-strand annealing, suggesting that they closely
          interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSB</ENAMEX>. It has been suggested in the case of
          RecT that it may compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSB</ENAMEX> for binding single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> overhangs and thereby make them available for the
          annealing process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Similar interactions between
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSB</ENAMEX>, that probably coats the ssDNA
          generated by nucleases, appear likely. Genes for SSAPs
          from all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> distinct superfamilies may also occur
          adjacent to or in the vicinity of genes encoding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleases</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holliday</ENAMEX> junction resolvases (HJRs). Genes
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding a λ</ENAMEX>-type exonuclease (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LE</ENAMEX>) of the type II
          restriction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> fold, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RecE</ENAMEX>, which also might be a
          divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this fold, and a nuclease of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Endonuclease VII</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EndoVII</ENAMEX>) fold [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 34</ENAMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> superfamily genes are associated with a RusA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily nuclease/HJR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EndoVII</ENAMEX> fold nucleases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, the 
          Borrelia plasmids that encode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX>,
          also almost always additionally encode a λ-type
          exonuclease, even if it is not the adjacent gene. In a
          single instance, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacterium 
          Ruminococcus albus, the gene
          encoding a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAD52</NUMEX> superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> occurs adjacent to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene for a λ</ENAMEX>-type exonuclease. These nucleases probably
          contribute to the repair process, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> are
          involved, by providing the initial break in the dsDNA
          and/or in digesting the nicked target to generate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ssDNA</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redβ</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> often co-occur with
          the SbcC gene that encodes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC ATPase</ENAMEX> with a large
          coiled-coil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are known to
          cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SbcD</ENAMEX>, nuclease of the calcineurin-like
          phosphoesterase superfamily and to degrade dsDNA in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' → <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' direction generating ssDNA [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . It seems
          likely that RecT/Redβ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, at least in certain
          cases, function in conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SbcCD-pathway</ENAMEX>, by
          utilizing the single-stranded regions generated by the
          SbcCD nuclease. Additionally, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, whose
          functions are less clear, tend to co-occur with the genes
          coding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX>. These include DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methyltransferases</ENAMEX> and the primosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein DnaD</ENAMEX> from
          low-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] that co-occur with
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 2, 4</ENAMEX>). The
          poorly characterized phage-or prophage-specific genes
          that are frequently observed in these neighborhoods
          include ORF15 ( 
          Streptococcus
          thermophilus bacteriophage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7201</TIMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF86</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF100a</TIMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> temperate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phage φSLT</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF364</TIMEX> (bacteriophage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">φ31.1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 2,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Secondary structure predictions indicate a high
          α-helical content for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It is likely that
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">α-helical proteins</ENAMEX> are phage innovations that could
          function as adaptors in the recombination pathway either
          as accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interacting domains</ENAMEX> or as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains.
        
        
          Evidence for convergent operon evolution and in
          situ non-orthologous displacement of genes in operons
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoding</ENAMEX> SSAPs
          A superposition of the gene neighborhood information
          upon the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAP</ENAMEX> superfamilies
          provides insights into the evolutionary processes that
          led to the emergence of the operons that include the SSAP
          genes. As discussed above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily
          clearly splits into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SbcC</ENAMEX> co-occurs with the SSAP
          once within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redβ</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and once within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RecT</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
          An examination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and the respective gene
          neighborhoods suggests that independent juxtaposition of
          SbcC with Redβ-like and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RecT</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate
          occasions is the most parsimonious explanation. The
          alternative explanation, namely that the gene coding for
          the common ancestor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> already
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-occurred with the 
          sbcC gene is far less likely
          because it would require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10</NUMEX> independent losses of
          this, apparently, functionally advantageous organization
          in different bacterial and bacteriophage lineages.
          Likewise, the observation that, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> cases,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding</ENAMEX> each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> co-occur in the same
          predicted operon with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSB</ENAMEX> or a λ-type exonuclease,
          suggests that similar operon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> may also emerge
          independently in evolution. Thus, the same or analogous
          operon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> may emerge convergently on multiple
          occasions, probably due to the selective pressure arising
          from the strong interactions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX> and their
          functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SbcC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LE</ENAMEX>.
          The distribution of the gene neighborhoods, in which a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> superfamily occurs next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecE</ENAMEX> on
          the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily,
          indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecE-RecT</ENAMEX> combination was probably the
          ancestral state for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the RecT</TIMEX> and EHAP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This implies that, on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> occasions,
          the gene for λ endonuclease displaced the functionally
          analogous 
          recE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and became the adjacent
          gene to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). That this displacement might have
          occurred by 
          in situ insertion of a
          non-orthologous gene is suggested by the detection, on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate occasions, of unusual remnants of
          pre-existing genes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT/Redβ</ENAMEX> superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>,
          namely EHAP1 from the enterobacteria and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PF161</ENAMEX> from 
          Borrelia hermsii, contain a small,
          C-terminal fragment of the core conserved domain of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> superfamily, which is located <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> of their 
          bona fide RecT/Redβ domains. These
          fragments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are closely related to other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> domains from related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and are unlikely to
          fold into the native conformation characteristic of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">full-length ERF</ENAMEX> domain. For example the ERF fragment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to the EHAP1 RecT/Redβ domain is closely related to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P22</NUMEX> phage ERF domain. This suggests that in each of
          these cases a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecT</ENAMEX> superfamily gene was inserted in frame
          into a pre-existing ERF gene leaving behind only a
          non-functional fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">it (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In a very similar
          case, the bacterial RAD52-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiga</ENAMEX> toxin
          encoding temperate phage is fused to an extreme
          C-terminal fragment that is nearly identical to the
          C-terminal most portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P22</NUMEX> ERF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In this
          case, it appears that the pre-existing ERF gene was
          displaced through the insertion of a bacterial RAD52-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, and in the same vein, the RecT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bacillus species</ENAMEX> contain a short
          C-terminal acidic module that is missing in other RecT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, but is highly similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSBs</ENAMEX>, particularly those from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacteria
          (data not shown). This suggests that, at some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> in
          their evolution, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus recT gene protein</ENAMEX> has
          recombined with the gene coding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSB</ENAMEX>, which might even
          have resulted in a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of an SSB with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAP</ENAMEX>.
          Thus it appears likely that functionally equivalent
          genes may displace their analogs in operons via insertion
          into the same position.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We show that functionally similar SSAPs belong to at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> evolutionarily distinct superfamilies. We unify
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redβ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RecT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and their homologs, which have
        not been reported as being related at the sequence level,
        into a single superfamily, supporting the notion that these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> share a similar mechanism of action. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superfamily</ENAMEX> typified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is predominantly
        found in bacteriophages and is also present on all circular
        plasmids from 
        Borrelia, suggesting a role in the
        recombination of these plasmids. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> superfamily,
        typified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast RAD52 protein</ENAMEX> and previously detected
        only in eukaryotes, was shown to include bacterial and
        phage homologs and to contain a modified HhH domain. By
        comparing the gene neighborhoods of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAPs</ENAMEX>, we show that
        the predicted operons that include the SSAP genes evolve
        according to the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">LEGO</ENAMEX>" principle. In these operons, the
        SSAP genes are linked to the genes for various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAses</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SbcC</ENAMEX>, which
        implies functional connections between the encoded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Evidence is presented of convergent emergence of
        similar SSAP-encoding operons in different lineages and of 
        in situ non-orthologous displacement
        of functionally similar genes in these operons.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Sequence searches of the non-redundant (NR) and the
        unfinished genomes databases, were done using the gapped
        BLAST and PSI-BLAST programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iterative</ENAMEX> PSI-BLAST
        searches used for in-depth sequence analysis were done with
        the profile inclusion cutoff expectation value (E value)
        set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>. Multiple sequence alignments were generated
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] and the output was
        adjusted using PSI-BLAST search results and secondary
        structure predictions, which were conducted using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jpred</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] programs. Fold predictions were
        done using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3-D</NUMEX> position specific score matrix (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3DPSSM</NUMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] and the Hybrid fold method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Phylogenetic
        analysis was carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining
        algorithm, with subsequent local rearrangements using the
        maximum likelihood algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . The robustness of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topology</ENAMEX> was assessed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resampling</ENAMEX> of
        Estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Log Likelihoods</ENAMEX> (RELL) bootstrap replicates. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLPHY</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phylip</ENAMEX> software packages were used for the
        analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] .
