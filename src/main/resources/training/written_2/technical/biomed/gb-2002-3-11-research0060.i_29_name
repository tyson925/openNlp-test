        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</TIMEX> we have witnessed an almost
        exponential growth of genomic sequence data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. This
        dramatic increase creates unique opportunities for
        comparative analysis leading to new insights into the
        behavior of living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">microorganisms</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the burning
        questions of modern genomics research is the need to assign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotations</ENAMEX> to new genes whose biological function is yet
        to be understood. Computational tools based on sequence
        homology have proved to be most broadly applicable for
        effective and accurate functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> of genes in
        newly sequenced genomes. Among them, BLAST and PSI-BLAST [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] are widely used to assign functions to newly sequenced
        open reading frames (ORFs) in genome sequence. However, one
        of the most surprising outcomes of genome research is that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 20</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of genes in newly sequenced genomes do not
        have statistically significant matches to functionally
        annotated sequences and are annotated as 'hypothetical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Accordingly, several non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">homology</ENAMEX>-based computational
        methods have been introduced recently in an attempt to
        provide putative functional assignments for those
        'hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>'. For example, among the most
        reliable methods, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta</ENAMEX> stone technique [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]
        detects functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-domain
        fusion events. Other methods include the chromosomal
        proximity method and the phylogenetic profile method.
        The chromosomal proximity method of Overbeek 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] is a popular technique
        that utilizes chromosomal proximity information to discover
        putative functional linkages between genes close to each
        other on the chromosome. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> appear as a
        neighboring gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in the genomes of several distantly
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (that is, they form a conserved gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>) it suggests the possibility that the genes might
        be functionally related [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In fact, the analysis of
        current data suggests that a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more genes
        that appears in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more distantly related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microorganisms</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> probability of being
        involved in the same broad functional category (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.Z.</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished data).
        Another seminal approach for establishing functional
        links between genes based on their coevolution patterns in
        different organisms was proposed and popularized by
        Pellegrini 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Similar proposals have
        been made by Gaasterland 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. This
        method constructs a genetic phylogenetic profile for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. A phylogenetic profile of a gene indicates the
        presence or the absence of this gene in each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> by an
        entry of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> in a long vector. In other words, each gene
        is assigned a binary vector of length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> used to
        construct the phylogenetic profiles. The 
        i th bit of the vector is set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> if
        a homologous gene exists in the 
        i th genome; otherwise it is set to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. Several variants of phylogenetic profiles have been
        described in the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. The functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">linkage</ENAMEX> is established when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have similar
        phylogenetic profiles, that is, they show a correlated
        pattern of inheritance across the genomes examined.
        Here we propose a new simple method for inferring
        functional linkages based on the phylogenetic profiles of
        gene clusters. This method simultaneously takes advantage
        of chromosomal proximity information and phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coevolution</ENAMEX> information. We demonstrate an enhanced ability
        to annotate a number of previously uncharacterized genes
        that are not yet functionally annotated and appear to
        resist the application of other computational
        techniques.
        Our new method constructs gene cluster phylogenetic
        profiles by recording the conservation pattern of a gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> that contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> neighboring genes in a
        set of reference genomes. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we will focus on
        gene clusters of size <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, that is, gene pairs. For a given
        gene pair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> (A and B are separate genes and are encoded
        continuously on the chromosome) in the target genome, the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> in a reference genome is recorded when we
        detect the presence of either an A'B' or a B'A' gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>, where gene A' is a homolog of gene A and gene B'
        is a homolog of gene B. There are many established methods
        for detecting homology or orthology, for example,
        membership in the same COG (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clusters of Orthologous Genes</ENAMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, homologs are detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> with
        an 
        E -value lower bound of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1e-10</ENAMEX> to
        filter out statistically insignificant matches.
        The implementation of the chromosomal proximity method
        does not strictly require successive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> in the genome. An
        important discovery in comparative genomics is that local
        gene rearrangements happen quite often during evolution,
        disrupting gene order in gene clusters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. To account
        for possible gene insertion and rearrangement events during
        evolution, a natural extension is to consider gene clusters
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> gaps. That is, we extend the detection of A'B'
        clusters to include A'xB' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A'xyB</ENAMEX>' clusters in the
        reference genomes, where x and y are inserted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (a
        maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>' are homologs of genes A and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Similarly</ENAMEX>, to be symmetric, we allow the gapped gene
        pairs in the target genome, that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AxB</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AxyB</ENAMEX> pairs
        where x and y are genes between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> and B in the target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. The implementation of the gapped version of the
        gene cluster phylogenetic profile method increases the
        number of putative functional linkages between genes and
        thus improves the sensitivity of the method. Here we report
        results from the gapped version of the method. From now on,
        we will refer to a single gene phylogenetic profile as SGPP
        and to a gene pair phylogenetic profile as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Examples of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependences</ENAMEX> revealed by
          GPPP
          We carried out an exhaustive grouping of the 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli gene</ENAMEX> pairs based
          on sharing the same GPPP (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamming</ENAMEX> distance equal to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zero</ENAMEX>). In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, our non-gapped GPPP method
          detects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> gene-pair clusters. These gene-pair clusters
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">351</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Low-quality profiles, which refer to
          profiles with a norm of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 4</NUMEX>, are excluded. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">norm</ENAMEX> of the profile is calculated by summing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1s</TIMEX> and
          0s in the profile vector (see Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1legend</TIMEX> for the
          definition of profile norm). By using the gapped GPPP
          method, we were able to detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">176</NUMEX> functionally related
          gene clusters containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">738</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. A two-dimensional
          representation of these clusters and their relationships
          is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. As a result, by using the GPPP
          method, we could establish functional linkages among
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 17%</NUMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genome</ENAMEX>.
          In many cases the GPPP method is able to establish
          functional linkages that are missed by the application of
          the SGPP method or the chromosomal proximity method
          independently. There are numerous examples where gene
          pairs share a common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GPPP</ENAMEX> and have a functional linkage,
          although the individual genes may not have similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SGPPs</ENAMEX>.
          Our method provides a new way to establish functional
          linkages between distant coevolved gene clusters on the
          chromosome, enhancing the ability to assign gene
          functions consistently in a broader genomic context. One
          such example consists of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene</ENAMEX> pairs:
          b1129(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi|1787374</NUMEX>)/b1130(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi|1787375</NUMEX>) and
          b4398(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi|1790860</NUMEX>)/b4399(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi|1790861</NUMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> pairs
          share the same GPPP (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), whereas individual genes
          do not have the same SGPP (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Hamming distances
          between the individual genes are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          The gene pair <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">b1129/b1130</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli encodes</ENAMEX> a two-component
          regulatory system PhoP-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PhoQ</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. This two-component
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is also present in several other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and is associated with virulence, adaptation to
          Mg <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-limiting environments and other cellular activities
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The gene b4399 has been annotated as a 'catabolite
          repression sensor kinase for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhoB</ENAMEX>, an alternative sensor
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhoB'</ENAMEX>, although it is far from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phoB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">b0399</NUMEX>) on the chromosome. In
          fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PhoB</ENAMEX> forms another two-component system with the
          product of its neighboring gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PhoR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">b0400</NUMEX>), which is
          responsible for phosphate regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The gene
          b4398 has been assigned a general function as a catabolic
          regulation response <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>. As these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> pairs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">b4398/b4399</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b1129/b1130</ENAMEX> share the same coevolution
          pattern, revealed by the gene-pair phylogenetic profiles,
          we suggest that the gene pair <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">b4398/b4399</ENAMEX> probably
          encodes another two-component system in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. This two-component system
          may be functionally closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PhoP-PhoQ system</ENAMEX> than
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PhoB-PhoR</ENAMEX> system. Interestingly, as no individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> has a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SGPP</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), relying on SGPP
          would miss this highly coupled functional linkage.
          Functional dependence between genes as a selective
          pressure sometimes favors gene clusters over random gene
          arrangement along the chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The chromosomal
          proximity method aims to detect local functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dependences</ENAMEX> ('intracluster' dependences) established by
          conserved proximity among distantly related genomes.
          However, functional dependencis between distant gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> ('intercluster' functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependences</ENAMEX>) on the
          chromosome usually cannot be resolved by the chromosomal
          proximity method. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> can reveal even distant
          functional dependences between gene clusters that
          participate in closely coupled processes or pathways. An
          example is the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli murG cluster</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">b0089, b0090,</ENAMEX>
          b0092) and the 
          lpxD cluster (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">b0177, b0179</ENAMEX>) which
          share the same GPPP; their current annotations are shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. They are both present in 
          Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydia
          trachomatis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xylella</ENAMEX> fastidiosa, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haemophilus</ENAMEX> influenzae,
          Neisseria meningitidis and 
          Pseudomonas aeruginosa and are
          absent in all the other genomes included. MurG, the last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> in the intracellular phase of peptidoglycan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, is essential for the production of the layers
          of peptidoglycan that protect cells from rupturing under
          high internal osmotic pressure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LpxD</ENAMEX> is a key
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> in lipid A biosynthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Lipid A is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">glucosamine</ENAMEX>-based phospholipid that makes up the
          monolayer of the outer membrane outside the peptidoglycan
          layers. None of the genes in these clusters is homologous
          to any of the others by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX>. The conventional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-homology</ENAMEX>-based chromosomal proximity method can imply
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">functional dependences</ENAMEX> inside each cluster separately.
          For example, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b0089</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">b0090</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">b0092</ENAMEX> are conserved among
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> above, we can infer functional linkage
          and interpret the collective function as cell-membrane
          maintenance from their current annotations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          However, with additional information from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX>, we can
          establish a distant intercluster functional dependence in
          addition to the intracluster dependences found by the
          chromosomal proximity method. As both clusters are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the outer membrane of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and are
          essential for survival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>], this
          dependence may suggest an inherent functional linkage
          between them. Noticing there is a hypothetical protein
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">b0177</NUMEX>) in the 
          lpxD gene cluster, we then carried
          out sequence analysis on this gene and its encoded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, expecting that it might be associated with the
          outer membrane of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. A simple BLASTP search tells
          us it has significant homology ( 
          E -value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0</NUMEX>) to the outer-membrane
          antigen present in many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Given that the
          lipid A layer provides anchoring sites for bacterial
          surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigens</ENAMEX> such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this
          discovery again supports the reliability of our
          prediction.
        
        
          Previously uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>
          By applying the GPPP method, a number of previously
          uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> with hypothetical or
          unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX> can now be functionally linked to
          characterized gene pairs. Some of these genes have not
          been assigned a function because of the lack of
          sufficient data at the time of annotation. We then
          carried out additional sequence analyses of these genes
          using BLAST, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pfam</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX> to confirm our
          prediction. A number of previously unknown genes that can
          be annotated by our method and can be confirmed by
          additional analysis are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. It can be seen
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3that</ENAMEX> many of the predictions made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> agree
          with more detailed sequence analysis.
        
        
          Accuracy of the GPPP method
          We have compared the accuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> with that of the
          SGPP method using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX>'s broad-function classification
          system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Genes in each cluster grouped by the same
          profile are labeled using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> broad functional
          categories excluding category <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> (general function) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">category S</ENAMEX> (function unknown). A good method for
          establishing functional linkages will tend to cluster
          genes within the same broad functional category. To this
          end, we devised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate procedures to compare the
          effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGPP</ENAMEX>, with the results
          summarized below. Because it is hard to calculate the
          number of false negatives, which are functionally
          dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or gene clusters that do not show a
          common coevolution pattern, we did not compare the
          sensitivities of these methods.
          The first accuracy measure is based on the proportion
          of 'pure' clusters among all the clusters. We defined
          satisfying pure clusters heuristically, considering the
          intrinsic vagueness of the concept 'broad category' and
          the fact that it is difficult to classify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>'
          functional roles precisely using a one-dimensional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">classification schema</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. If more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in a cluster stay within a certain COG broad
          functional category, which means that they might be
          involved in the same biological process, we consider this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> as a pure cluster. The proportion of such pure
          clusters among the total clusters serves as a coarse
          measure of the specificity of the phylogenetic profile
          method.
          We plotted this measure versus the norm of the profile
          for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGPP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>). To account for the
          possible systematic bias of this measure toward sizes of
          the clusters, we also plotted the average cluster size
          versus the norm of the profile (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>). Figure
          3bshows that except at the very ends of the norm axis
          (norm = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>) the average cluster sizes from both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGPP</ENAMEX> are close to each other.
          In the other experiment to compare accuracy, we simply
          examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that end up in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> and calculated the frequency with which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are from the same functional category. This
          measure is essentially the same as the Jaccard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> ( 
          C ) referred to in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Given a
          gene cluster, let 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> be the number of all pairs of
          genes chosen from this cluster and 
          S be the number of all pairs of
          genes that are chosen from this cluster and are from the
          same COG category. Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaccard</ENAMEX> coefficient is
          calculated by 
          C = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> . 
          C varies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and is
          less dependent on cluster size, unlike the previous
          measure. 
          C is plotted versus the norm of the
          profile in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In both experiments (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
          we see that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> achieves a higher accuracy (an increase
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> on average) than the conventional SGPP method,
          especially in the norm range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 20</TIMEX>.
          From the information theory perspective, we know that
          the predictive quality of a profile is reflected by its
          mutual information:
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          i ) is the probability of seeing 
          i ( 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>) in the profile vector and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> ( 
          i,j ) is the probability of seeing
          ( 
          i,j ) jointly in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> aligned
          profiles 
          I and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX> In theory, the predictive value
          is maximized when half the entries in a profile are 1s
          and the others are 0s (high mutual information (MI)
          regions). The bell-like accuracy curve for the profile
          methods (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) can be explained by considering
          the information content of profiles, which is low when
          the norm of a profile is close to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (a vector with all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">entries 0</ENAMEX>) or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> (a vector with all entries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          (low-MI regions). Intuitively, the fact that certain gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> appear in every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> or appear in only one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX> does not necessarily indicate functional
          relationship. We can see that when the profiles are near
          these low-MI regions, the size of the clusters tends to
          increase dramatically, suggesting the corruption of
          coevolution signals (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5b</TIMEX>). It is important to
          realize which regions our functional linkages are
          established from when we use these phylogenetic profile
          methods.
          As more and more fully sequenced genomes of
          microorganisms have become available, it is natural to
          ask whether the accumulation of new genomes will help us
          improve the accuracy of the phylogenetic profile methods.
          With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 77</NUMEX> sequenced genomes now available, we
          were able to expand the phylogenetic profile analysis to
          a larger set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Using total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">68 microorganisms</NUMEX>,
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5awe</NUMEX> plot the accuracy versus the norm and in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5bwe</NUMEX> plot the average size distribution for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGPP</ENAMEX>. We can see that the accuracy of the GPPP
          method is improved <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5%</NUMEX> on average when more genomes
          are included and the cluster sizes tend to become
          smaller. However, we did not see dramatic improvements
          when using the larger set of genomes, which made us think
          there may be an upper limit to the accuracy of the
          phylogenetic profile method. When more genomes are
          included, both the coevolution signal and the noise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> are 'amplified', so we would not expect the
          accuracy of the phylogenetic method to improve
          dramatically when a larger, randomly selected genome set
          is sampled unless a clever sampling strategy is used. All
          accuracy curves (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5a</ENAMEX>) show that the GPPP
          method outperforms the SGPP method. The improved accuracy
          makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GPPP</ENAMEX> a possible complementary annotation tool to
          aid conventional homology-based sequence comparison.
          To measure the robustness of the GPPP method for a
          larger sample of genomes, we also examined whether the
          functional linkages previously established by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-dimensional profiles can still be recovered by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>-dimensional profiles. We find that the previously
          reported functional linkages can be completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconfirmed</ENAMEX> (data not shown), which suggests that the
          true coevolution patterns of certain gene clusters are
          robust when a wider range of genomes are sampled and
          appear to resist the noise due to evolutionary diversity
          that could be introduced when more genomes are used.
          Additionally, the GPPP method using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> genomes generates
          additional putative functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]
          for a complete list). As some microorganisms are closely
          related to each other (for example, different strains of
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>), it is important to realize that the
          number of 'informative' genomes is less than the number
          of genomes included. The discriminative power of
          phylogenetic profiles will be improved when a proper
          strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sampling organisms</ENAMEX> in different taxa is
          developed.
          In summary, gene cluster phylogenetic profiles combine
          and improve on the chromosomal proximity method and the
          single-gene phylogenetic profile method. A gene cluster
          phylogenetic profile with a large norm simply states the
          fact that this gene cluster is highly conserved across
          different organisms, which is equivalent to the
          chromosomal proximity method. By clustering gene clusters
          with the same phylogenetic profiles, we are able to
          detect functional linkages between distant genomic
          regions on the chromosome based on their pattern of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coevolution</ENAMEX>. A phylogenetic profile of a single gene
          could be corrupted by many genomic events during
          evolution, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene duplication</ENAMEX> or the possible loss
          of gene functions after speciation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], which
          introduces noise into the coevolution patterns. As the
          requirement for the presence of a gene cluster is
          stricter than for the presence of a single gene, the pair
          profiles help to obtain an improvement in the accuracy of
          functional linkage detection.
          Genes in microorganisms are known to form operons,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">two-component</ENAMEX> systems, paralogous gene clusters, and
          other functionally related genomic clusters. As described
          in here, the implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPPs</ENAMEX> gives us a tool for
          establishing functional linkages between these genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> even when they are not physically close on the
          chromosome. In some cases, these functional associations
          can help us understand the dependencies between gene
          clusters in biological processes, such as the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murG</ENAMEX> and 
          lpxD clusters described in this
          paper.
          In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPPs</ENAMEX>, we could naturally develop
          software for detecting higher-order profiles of bigger
          gene clusters; however, we would expect to see a smaller
          coverage with a possibly higher accuracy. In fact, we
          observed that some gene pairs with the same phylogenetic
          profile reside in a close proximity on the chromosome,
          which suggests a longer conserved gene cluster (for
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal gene clusters</ENAMEX>). Ultimately, all these
          techniques are based on the identification of gene
          clusters that show similar inheritance patterns across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homology</ENAMEX>-based annotation tools aim to detect sequence
          similarity between new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and known genes by following
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-by-one</NUMEX> gene annotation methodology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPP</ENAMEX>,
          however, detects functional relationship between clusters
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the basis of their coevolution patterns
          across genomes, and is able to assign gene functions in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by considering a wider genomic context. With the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of fully sequenced genomes, the information
          content in gene cluster phylogenetic profiles is expected
          to increase, as does the accuracy of the proposed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPPPs</ENAMEX>, and possibly higher-order gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> phylogenetic profiles, together with other
          non-homology methods, are likely to substantially
          increase our ability to assign function to a large number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">putative genes</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        We initially chose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> fully sequenced microbial genomes,
        including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> archaeal genomes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> bacterial genomes.
        While this work was in progress the number of fully
        sequenced microbial genomes grew to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 70</NUMEX>. We then
        expanded our study to a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to estimate
        the robustness of the phylogenetic profile method and
        present the results on accuracy evaluation. All protein
        sequences were retrieved from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for</ENAMEX>
        Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genome repository. We
        chose 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K12</ENAMEX> as the target genome for
        functional linkage detection and the other genomes as
        reference genomes for constructing the gene cluster
        phylogenetic profiles. We performed pairwise
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-against-all BLAST searches to identify all homologous 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        By determining the presence or absence of all possible
        neighboring 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene</ENAMEX>-pair clusters in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>
        other genomes, we were able to get a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 × 1</NUMEX> binary
        profile vectors that are similar in spirit to the ones
        obtained by the SGPP method. The profile of a gene cluster
        is simply a binary vector that has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in coordinate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> if the gene cluster occurs in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K th</ENAMEX> genome; otherwise it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> in
        that coordinate. To measure the similarity between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        phylogenetic profiles, we use the Hamming distance, simply
        expressed by the number of vector entries that need to be
        changed to obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> profile from the other profile. Other
        natural techniques can include mutual information (MI) or
        correlation coefficients (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>) that measure the statistical
        dependence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> discrete distributions of coevolution
        patterns.
        The list of possible functionally linked gene clusters
        reported by both the gapped and non-gapped versions of GPPP
        can be accessed at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
