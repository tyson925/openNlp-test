        While our understanding of the nature hypnosis is
        complex and contested, it is rapidly evolving. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] In practice it can be useful to think of hypnosis as an
        altered state of consciousness, and hypnotherapy as a
        treatment modality utilizing hypnosis to achieve a
        therapeutic goal. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of hypnosis is a natural mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        For example: When engaged in imaginary play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are
        often in a state of self-hypnosis; when bored in a
        classroom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> sometimes use self-hypnosis to imagine
        themselves engaged in an activity elsewhere; and mental
        rehearsal of a performance is often done in a state of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">self-hypnosis.</ENAMEX>
        There are many popular misconceptions regarding
        hypnosis: [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypnotherapy</ENAMEX> does not involve one person
        controlling another's mind, inducing sleep, inducing forced
        amnesia, or causing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to do things against their
        will. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage hypnotist</ENAMEX>, who appears to be controlling
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, first enlists their cooperation by asking for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">volunteers</ENAMEX>, and then picks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who can use hypnosis
        easily. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] Thus, a stage hypnotist uses his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>'
        hypnotic capacity for entertainment, and not for
        therapeutic benefit.
        In addition to therapist-assisted hypnosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can
        be taught to use self-hypnosis to achieve desired effects.
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 5 8</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypnosis</ENAMEX> is useful in altering thoughts,
        feelings, expectations, attitudes, perception, behavior,
        and even physiology. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 6</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, hypnotherapy can
        be used to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>, pain, discomfort, to change
        habits, or as an aid in differential diagnosis. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] For
        example, a symptom that clears with the use of
        hypnosis-induced relaxation may have a psychological
        component. However, as hypnosis has been demonstrated to
        have physiologic effects, e.g. on airway reactivity, blood
        flow and immune response, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] benefits of hypnosis may be
        attributable to resultant alterations of physiology.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hypnotherapy</ENAMEX> often is utilized to complement medical
        therapy. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 5</NUMEX> ] However, use of hypnosis sometimes can
        replace pharmacological therapy, e.g. for the treatment of
        phlebotomy-associated pain or migraine headaches. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] The
        practitioner who uses hypnotherapy should keep in mind that
        sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are referred for hypnotherapy with an
        organic condition for which hypnosis is not an appropriate
        therapy. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        Because of their natural practice in the use of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imagination</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> readily use hypnosis. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] A
        fundamental theme of pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypnosis</ENAMEX> is to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        develop their own abilities and ownership of
        self-regulation strategies. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] Thus, it is important to
        ensure that it becomes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s desire to use hypnosis
        as therapy, otherwise the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is unlikely to cooperate,
        and the hypnosis is less likely to be successful. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 5</NUMEX> ]
        For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have different abilities to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visual</ENAMEX>, auditory, tactile, kinesthetic, or olfactory
        imagery. Therefore, the hypnotherapist should offer
        hypnotic imagery that is based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s interests
        and abilities.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' role in hypnotherapy is based on their
        involvement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s condition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s age,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s needs for autonomy, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>'
        willingness and ability to participate in the
        hypnotherapeutic process. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> often are
        given the opportunity to learn about hypnosis outside of
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' presence in order to minimize their anxiety
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> successful performance, or to allay concerns about
        parental interference. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        In order to demonstrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of hypnotherapy in a
        pediatric practice, this report describes how it was used
        effectively by a pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonologist</ENAMEX> during his first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 months</TIMEX> of experience with hypnosis.
      
      
        Methods
        Hypnotherapy was offered to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">303</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pediatric Pulmonary Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syracuse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 - October 31, 2000</TIMEX> (constituting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 30 month</TIMEX> period).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> offered hypnotherapy included those thought to
        have pulmonary symptoms attributable to psychological
        issues (e.g. habit <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>, or anxiety induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shortness</ENAMEX> of
        breath), discomfort due to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, or fear of
        procedures. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who remained symptomatic despite
        aggressive medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> also were offered hypnosis
        since psychological factors may cause symptoms in some of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were encouraged to identify
        issues for which they might use hypnosis. Several patients
        asked for and received suggestions about how to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX> to ameliorate non-pulmonary symptoms such as
        abdominal pain, headaches, and insomnia, or to help improve
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or athletic performance.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were taught self-hypnosis by their pediatric
        pulmonologist, who had received training in hypnotherapy
        through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two 20-hour</TIMEX> hypnosis workshops offered by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Society of Clinical Hypnosis</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Developmental</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behavioral Pediatrics</ENAMEX>.
        For many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> described in this report, the
        initial hypnosis session took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 45 minutes</TIMEX>.
        This session usually consisted of: (I) A pre-hypnotic
        interview, during which the concept of hypnosis was
        introduced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Concerns or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misconceptions</ENAMEX> regarding hypnosis were addressed at this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) Hypnosis induction and deepening were dependent
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' developmental level, and based on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' aptitude and preference. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 13</ENAMEX> ] Thus, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learned that the hypnosis experience was in their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Typically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> chose to imagine a favorite
        place. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were taught to relax with aid of
        hypnosis, and how to employ imagery specific to their
        symptom. For example, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> learned to imagine the
        appearance of their airways when they were symptomatic, and
        to imagine changing the appearance to a normal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> sometimes were given the suggestion that their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subconscious</ENAMEX> would take care of their problem before they
        would become consciously aware of it. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) Prior to trance
        termination <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were instructed to give themselves
        suggestions for improvement regarding issues of importance
        to them. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX>) Following the hypnosis sessions, the
        experience was discussed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were reminded that improvements with hypnosis can
        take time, and that with practice more improvement can be
        expected.
        Alteration of pain or taste perception often was taught
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>, by suggesting that the patient imagine
        being in a relaxing place, followed by a suggestion that
        yielded the desired change in perception. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        Fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> met with the pulmonologist
        to work exclusively on hypnosis for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> session.
        Thereafter, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requested that further
        sessions be devoted solely to hypnosis. For all other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> use of hypnosis was integrated into their regular
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-30 minute</TIMEX> medical follow-up visits. Within these visits,
        reinforcement of hypnosis work usually took <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than five</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were encouraged to practice self-hypnosis
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least a few minutes</TIMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis until
        their symptom resolved or improved.
        The outcome of hypnotherapy was determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
        answers to open-ended questions posed orally by the
        pulmonologist, regarding their subjective evaluation of the
        efficacy of their use of hypnosis. For most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">habit cough</ENAMEX> or conversion reaction, initial assessment of
        change in symptoms was accomplished during the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX> visit. Also, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> demonstrated their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of pain or taste perception immediately following
        their initial hypnosis instruction. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who used
        hypnosis for other conditions, assessment of change in
        symptoms was gauged during follow-up visits. For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were asked whether they had used hypnosis, and
        whether they felt their symptoms improved as a result of
        its use.
        As this report describes a retrospective chart audit
        without identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, it was eligible for
        exemption from review by an institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX>.

        for whom results are reported. Fifty-six of these patients
        were offered hypnotherapy for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> reason.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in this report was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.2 years</TIMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-20</ENAMEX>).

        of hypnotherapy. In other cases improvement was achieved
        after hypnosis was used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
        symptoms worsened and no new symptoms emerged following

        Hypnotherapy was used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with pulmonary

        Discussion
        As illustrated by this report, hypnotherapy can provide
        therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pediatric</ENAMEX> Pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were unlikely to have achieved
        rapid improvement of their symptoms without use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX>. It is possible that some of the improvement
        attributed to hypnosis was a result of the increased
        attention provided by the clinician while teaching
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX>. However, hypnotherapy without suggestions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> at a specific symptom, as well as directed
        suggestions without use of hypnosis, often do not yield
        improvement. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4</NUMEX> ] It also is possible that a reporting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> may have falsely increased the apparent success of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX> in this study, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> wanted to please
        their treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>. The impact of this possibility
        may be minimal, as many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> helped by hypnosis
        had reported little or no improvement with previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapies</ENAMEX> suggested and applied by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>.
        The potential mechanisms by which hypnosis may have
        helped these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are varied. For example, the
        improvement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> may have been the
        result of physiologic changes induced by hypnosis. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        On the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with shortness of breath
        may have developed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> or panic as a result of
        recurrent episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>-associated shortness of
        breath. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] Such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> could have caused further
        shortness of breath and vocal cord dysfunction, which can
        cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stridor</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 16 18</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypnotherapy</ENAMEX> may have been
        useful for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> is very amenable
        to treatment with hypnosis. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Additionally</ENAMEX>, patients
        who successfully utilized hypnosis in this report may have
        benefited from the increased feeling of self-mastery
        provided by its application. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 19 20 21</ENAMEX> ]
        The potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of hypnosis for respiratory
        problems is illustrated further by the usual treatment for
        vocal cord dysfunction. This typically involves speech
        therapy techniques [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 18</NUMEX> ] that are analogous to
        hypnotherapeutic strategies, both in developing focused
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, training a ritualistic behavior, and
        repetitive "practice" with concentration and relaxation.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">habit cough</ENAMEX> have been reported to
        improve with use of suggestion therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] that probably
        represents a form of hypnosis.
        Limitations of this report include its retrospective
        nature that precludes a consistently organized analysis of
        the effects of hypnosis in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally, bias was likely introduced, as the results
        and conclusions in this report are largely based on
        subjective assessments of outcome, which were probably
        influenced by the expectations of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinician</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> are especially adept at learning to use
        hypnosis, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13 23</NUMEX> ] which may account for the high rate
        of reported success. The success rate may also have been
        high because hypnosis was offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were
        likely to benefit, such as those with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> or those for
        whom medical therapy was not helpful. On the other hand,
        many of the instances in which little or no improvement was
        noted might have been avoided had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinician</ENAMEX> had more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 months</TIMEX> of experience in assessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>'
        initial attitude. Thus, some of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not
        use hypnosis on their own and reported no improvement in
        their symptoms might not have been offered initial
        instruction at that time by a more experienced clinician.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may have been more successful if increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rapport</ENAMEX> was established, or if different imagery was
        employed. Further, it is possible that with practice
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX> might have become beneficial for some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who initially reported no improvement.
        A common concern among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> contemplating the
        addition of hypnosis to their clinical practice is the
        perception that hypnotherapy requires too much time, both
        for assessment of patient readiness, and for hypnotherapy
        itself. However, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in this report
        benefited from hypnosis despite the time limitation imposed
        by a medical setting. Additionally, for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        this report use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypnosis</ENAMEX> actually saved time and
        expense. For example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">habit cough</ENAMEX> might
        undergo multiple investigations and receive numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> in evaluation and treatment of his symptom. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] For the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with habit cough in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, hypnotherapy was curative after a single session.
        Some hypnotherapeutic interventions require a large number
        of sessions. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> needing more time than is
        available in a medical setting may be referred to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> specializing in hypnotherapy (usually
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">psychiatrists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>, or social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>).
        Another concern of clinicians is that one must have
        substantial training and experience to be able to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX> effectively. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in this report were
        treated by a motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his first 30 months</TIMEX> of
        offering hypnotherapy. Therefore, it appears possible that
        use of hypnosis can be learned rapidly and thereafter used
        effectively.
        Use of hypnotherapy is one of several treatment options
        that attempt to affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' physiological response by
        inducing a change in their mental processes. Other methods
        based on the same principle include biofeedback, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meditation</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] relaxation training, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and
        utilization of the placebo effect as therapy. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] Future
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blinded</ENAMEX> and controlled research protocols should help
        define optimal psychological therapeutic approaches for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, delineate the proportion of a pediatric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that may benefit from hypnosis, and identify
        hypnotherapeutic suggestions that are most likely to be
        successful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        Aside from successful use of hypnosis in a pediatric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pulmonology</ENAMEX> practice, as described in this report, other
        common pediatric problems that have been demonstrated to be
        amenable to treatment with hypnosis include attentional
        disorders, chronic pain, functional abdominal pain,
        enuresis, migraine headaches, nail biting, and thumb
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sucking</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 4 5 13 28</NUMEX> ]
      
      
        Conclusions
        By learning about hypnosis, pediatricians will be able
        use an additional form of treatment for many different
        symptoms. Also, pediatricians may learn about better ways
        of interacting with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without use of "formal"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypnosis</ENAMEX>. For example, they can learn to identify and
        utilize spontaneous hypnotic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] or learn to induce such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with story telling or
        blowing bubbles. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] As a result of work with hypnosis,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pediatricians</ENAMEX> also will become more aware of the importance
        of using an encouraging and positive approach with their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, as well as effective use of body language. [ 2
        ]
        Use of hypnosis is a skill most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can learn. [ 1
        ] As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child advocates</ENAMEX>, pediatricians should consider
        teaching this skill to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, as it can become an
        invaluable tool for a large number of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
