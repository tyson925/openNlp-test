        In spite of advances in surgical and pharmacological
        treatment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the aneurysmal subarachnoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemorrhage</ENAMEX> (SAH) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> die and many who survive need
        rehabilitation to maintain independence, causing
        significant economic losses to medical and social care.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 90%</NUMEX> of SAH cases are caused by a ruptured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Per-case mortality for ruptured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAs</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 to 50%</NUMEX> and
        morbidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 66%</NUMEX> as opposed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2%</NUMEX> mortality and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
        morbidity for elective surgery of unruptured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAs</ENAMEX> in
        asymptomatic low-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . Given the marked
        contrast between the outcomes of elective versus emergency
        surgery, the goal has to be identification and treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAs</ENAMEX> prior to rupture.
        There is substantial debate regarding the cost-benefit
        ratio of population screening [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Restricting
        screening to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> at high risk both for
        developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IA</ENAMEX> and for rupture would improve the
        cost-benefit ratio. Characterization of environmental and
        genetic risk factors would allow not only reduction of risk
        through behavior modification, but also significantly
        improve detection. Additionally, some environmental and
        genetic risk factors may be amenable to pharmacological
        intervention. Simple tests for genetic risk factors would
        permit the identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> at high risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and rupture of aneurysms, consequently allowing
        diagnostic effort to be concentrated on a smaller group
        that is at higher risk.
        Currently, several risk factors have been identified
        including cigarette smoking, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arterial hypertension</ENAMEX>, gender,
        aging, atherosclerosis and heavy alcohol consumption [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Initial indications of a genetic component were
        based on collections of case reports that suggested that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAs</ENAMEX> are associated with some rare simple Mendelian
        disorders, e.g. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ehlers Danlos</ENAMEX> syndrome type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and the Marfan
        syndrome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . More recent systematic prevalence
        estimates indicate either absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> or
        markedly reduced prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with rare
        simple Mendelian disorders [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . Also, genetic
        analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known to cause some simple Mendelian
        disorders have proven negative for collections of patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . The familial occurrence of IAs not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with known simple <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Mendelian disorders</ENAMEX> was first
        noted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and, since then, nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX>
        case reports and review articles have been published.
        Population-based studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> probands show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
        have a family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX>, a higher percentage than
        previously appreciated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 19 20</ENAMEX> ] . These familial IA
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have no signs of any other simple Mendelian
        disorders predisposing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX>, supporting the possibility
        that some or all IAs have a genetic component, and that FIA
        is a genetic disease separate and apart from previously
        defined <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. The inheritance patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIA</ENAMEX> have not
        been determined, partly because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> is a late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-onset
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and partly because it is likely to be a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multifactorial disease</ENAMEX> for which simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mendelian</ENAMEX> models
        will not fit well [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 21 22 23</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study subjects
          Eighty-five <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with
          ruptured or unruptured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> and no family history of
          polycystic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney disease</ENAMEX> were ascertained from a
          sampling frame of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1150</TIMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1977 and 1990</TIMEX> for aneurysmal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAH</ENAMEX> by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurosurgery</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Hospital</ENAMEX> of
          Kuopio, which serves a genetically homogenous population
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">870,000</NUMEX> in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Initially, family
          history was assessed by a short questionnaire and all
          putative cases were confirmed from medical and autopsy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>. Due to the high mortality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> and lack of
          pre-rupture symptoms, surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> with known IA
          were rare. We therefore used magnetic resonance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiography</ENAMEX> to screen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 30</TIMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">probands</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Positive magnetic resonance
          angiography findings were then confirmed using digital
          subtraction angiography. Upper-abdominal ultrasonography
          was performed on all screened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and confirmed
          that none of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> had evidence of polycystic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney disease</ENAMEX>. In this manner, we detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>
          with asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX>, giving a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> affected sib
          pairs from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 sibships</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> extended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 21 and 29</TIMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sibships each; Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> non-sib <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was detected in one of the sibships
          in family <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> analyses below; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          and eliminated from the analyses, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPs</ENAMEX> for the
          genome scan. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPs</ENAMEX> were comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> were obtained from affected family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, unaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, where
          possible. Due to the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at onset, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were
          available in only a few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. All family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> were confirmed through registries kept by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland</ENAMEX>.
          The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the
          Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Boards</ENAMEX> of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital of Kuopio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study design
          Whole-genome scans are labor-intensive and costly
          since each individual in the study must be genotyped for
          all markers. Reduction of the number of samples
          genotyped, or the number of markers, or both, has been
          shown to be efficient [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . We used a
          two-stage design. In stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are genotyped at
          low density and subsequently at higher density in stage
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, thereby reducing the overall number of markers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyped</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stage 1</ENAMEX> data were analysed using a liberal Î± â‰ˆ
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lod</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>). Regions exceeding the threshold were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyped</ENAMEX> in stage 2.
          Power was computed assuming a two-stage design, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPs</ENAMEX>, and a map density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> cM. For stage I alone, we
          had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 96%</NUMEX> power to detect "significant linkage"
          (lod score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] to a locus with a
          locus-specific relative risk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> and at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> power to detect "suggestive linkage" to a locus
          with a locus-specific relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
        
        
          DNA isolation and pre-amplification
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was collected into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>-containing tubes.
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated either by an automated procedure
          (Genepure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA extractor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, CA) or manually (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Puregene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolation kit, Gentra
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>). Genotyping was performed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>, either untreated or amplified linearly
          using primer-extension preamplification [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> was used for
          preamplification with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> -primer [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . The resulting
          preamplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was then used as a template in marker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> with specific primers.
        
        
          Genotyping
          Most of the initial genotyping was performed by the
          National <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heart Lung and Blood Institute Mammalian</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genotyping Service</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshfield Research Foundation</ENAMEX>
          using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> version 8 screening set [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primer</ENAMEX> pairs for additional markers were obtained from
          Research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL</ENAMEX>). For the
          additional genotyping, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> were carried out with one of
          the primers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">radioactively</ENAMEX> labeled. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> were set up using
          a laboratory workstation (Biomek <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beckman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) and performed in PEC <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9600</TIMEX> thermal cyclers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin Elmer Cetus, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA). The alleles were
          scored visually from autoradiographs and entered into an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> database (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Redwood Shores</ENAMEX>, CA).
          Population frequencies for each marker were estimated
          from a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 to 24</NUMEX> unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Markov</ENAMEX>-process-based test of genetic relationship [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] using all the marker data across the genome was used
          on each nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to confirm the sib-pair
          relationship; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> non-sib <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was detected in one of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibships</ENAMEX> in family <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> (Figure. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and eliminated from the
          analyses. The results were consequently derived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibships</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The genotype data were analyzed for genetic linkage
          with both single-marker and multipoint <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASP</ENAMEX> lod
          score analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] using the computer program

        Results
        
          Genome-wide linkage analysis
          We performed stage I of a two-stage genome scan using
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ASPs</ENAMEX>. Due to the genetic homogeneity of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38 39 40</NUMEX> ] the probability
          of identifying genetic risk factors in a complex disease
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIA</ENAMEX> may be substantially improved [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 40</NUMEX> ] .
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cM genome scan was performed
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> screening set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and the data
          analyzed using both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point and multipoint ASP linkage
          analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> regions on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 6, 7p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>, with multipoint lod scores exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>
          (pointwise P-value â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‰ˆ 0.05</NUMEX>) were identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Two
          regions had MLSs exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.58</NUMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.08</NUMEX> on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-point lod scores exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent markers in each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, ruling
          out substantial genotyping error in one marker as the
          cause of the high lod scores. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> additional regions
          with multipoint lod scores exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosomes 4,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7q</ENAMEX>) also had substantial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point lod scores at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">marker</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7p and 14q</TIMEX>),
          however, only one marker had a high <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point lod score.
          In both cases, the significant marker was either the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or the last marker typed on the chromosome.
          Following conventional guidelines, we considered an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLS</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> or greater to be "significant linkage" and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLS</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> to be "suggestive linkage" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          In stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>, we genotyped additional markers in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> regions identified in stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> additional
          markers flanking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D7S1819</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7p</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> additional
          markers flanking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D14S1434</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14q</TIMEX> were typed and the
          resulting maximum MLSs were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.28</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7p</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.80</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14q</NUMEX>),
          indicating that the previous linkage signals were likely
          due to the increased statistical variability commonly
          seen in the multipoint signal at the most extreme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. We therefore eliminated regions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7p and 14q</TIMEX> from
          further consideration. Additional markers were typed in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> with maximum MLSs
          exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX>. A multipoint plot for the chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> is
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLS</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.58</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">D19S245</NUMEX> -
          D19S246. The maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLS</ENAMEX> for chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> decreased from
          2.08 at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DXS987</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.33</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DXS1226</TIMEX>, (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> cM
          centromeric from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DXS987</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLS</ENAMEX> for the region on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chromosome X</ENAMEX> decreased considerably with the addition of
          several new markers and consequent improvement in the
          accuracy of the multipoint allele-sharing estimates,
          which were clearly overestimated when only the initial
          scan markers were included in the analysis. All the
          evidence for linkage in this region was due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother-brother</ENAMEX> pairs; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-sister</ENAMEX> pairs and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother-sister</ENAMEX> pairs gave maximum MLSs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX>
          in this region.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The relatively high prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAs</ENAMEX> and aneurysmal SAH
        place the disease in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of moderately common
        disorders. Consequently, it shares some of the features
        that make common disorders <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with respect to genetic
        analysis. These include: low sibling relative risks due to
        the high population prevalence; presence of multiple
        genetic loci, each contributing a small portion of the
        sibling relative risk; incomplete penetrance of genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX>; environmental risk factors; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late age</TIMEX> at onset; and
        phenocopies, i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> due to purely environmental
        factors. Additional complexity for genetic analysis arises
        due to diagnostic uncertainty. Several measures were taken
        to increase the probability of success. We used robust,
        model-free, allele-sharing genetic analyses to address the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexity</ENAMEX>, we studied a relatively genetically homogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and we verified that all putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAs</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saccular</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 20 41 42 43</NUMEX> ] . It is expected that a
        genetically homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, particularly one with a
        recent population bottleneck [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] , segregates for
        fewer disease loci thereby allowing a smaller sample size
        to be informative. Additionally, our study design was
        cost-effective, two-stage design with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPs</ENAMEX>. We are
        collecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPs</ENAMEX> for further study.
        The most promising locus with a maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLS</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> was
        on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>. The peak is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately</NUMEX> in
        19q12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>, a gene-rich region containing a number of loci
        related to cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiology</ENAMEX> and pathobiology. These include urokinase-type
        plasminogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activator receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLAUR; MIM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">173391</ENAMEX>, see

        .
        It is noteworthy that none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in which we
        found some evidence for linkage, either tentative or
        suggestive, are similar to the regions detected in another
        recent genome-wide scan for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> susceptibility <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ]
        . Although our study found evidence for a region with
        tentative linkage on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7q</NUMEX>, the region identified
        in this study is near the telomere and does not overlap
        with the region of suggestive linkage near the centromere
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7q</TIMEX> identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onda et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        that were studied are distinct, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finns</ENAMEX> as compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>; however, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were small and it is
        therefore possible that there may yet be some overlap in
        genetic predisposition.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of suggestive linkage, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> and the other on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome in a sample
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ASPs</ENAMEX>. Although we initially detected regions of
        tentative linkage on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 6, 7p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7q and 14</TIMEX>, the
        regions on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7p and 14</TIMEX> were excluded upon additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX>. None of the regions detected in this study
        overlap with the regions detected in a sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] .
