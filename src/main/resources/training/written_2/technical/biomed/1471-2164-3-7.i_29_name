        Knowing the differences in gene expression levels among
        different tissues is of paramount interest in various areas
        of biomedical research. These include, but are by no means
        limited to, (i) comparisons of healthy and diseased tissue
        in order to understand malfunctions in regulation and
        identify genes essential for control, thus identifying
        target molecules for the development of novel therapeutics
        and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the observation of changes in expression over time
        after addition of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> to elucidate the mechanism of
        action of pharmaceuticals and predict their toxicology.
        Experiments in that realm furthermore help to understand
        the molecular basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, provide means for early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostics</ENAMEX>, and facilitate monitoring of therapy.
        Examples for analog techniques representing mRNA
        expression patterns are subtractive cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Differential Display</ENAMEX> method and its
        derivatives [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . Macro- and microarrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        are rapidly becoming the analog method of choice, mainly
        due to their high throughput in data production which
        allows complex biological questions to be addressed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> methods for counting differences in gene
        expression levels provide specific advantages. With the
        expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) approach [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] expression
        patterns are analyzed by sequencing many clones from cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>. Even limited sequence information on the cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end (tag sequences) permits unambiguous identification
        of the cDNA and the corresponding gene. The different
        frequencies of cDNAs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> derived from different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> give evidence of possible changes in gene
        expression. This approach provides accurate quantitative
        information and has a flexible degree of sensitivity which
        depends solely on the number of analyzed clones. However,
        this is very labor-intensive. In order to analyze the
        expression of low abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX> that represent mRNA in the
        range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy per mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100.000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> have to be analyzed per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. Improvements in
        sequencing automation and analysis such as capillary
        electrophoresis have speeded up the process considerably
        and recent developments such as a sequencing method based
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">real-time pyrophosphate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , sequencing on
        microchips [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and massive parallel signature
        sequencing on microbead arrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] also contribute to
        the speed and depth of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> gene expression analysis.
        Oligonucleotide fingerprinting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] characterizes
        expressed genes via the hybridization of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of</NUMEX>
        synthetic oligonucleotides to cDNA that produces unique
        fingerprints of matching and non-matching oligonucleotides.
        Another approach to increase throughput is the serial
        analysis of gene expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>). Short defined cDNA
        sequences are initially prepared from mRNA which are then
        dimerized, multimerized, cloned, and sequenced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> accelerated the process of gene expression analysis
        more than an order of magnitude compared to the
        conventional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> analysis and still is compatible with most
        of the improvements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX> mentioned above.
        However, after the identification of differentially
        expressed cDNA the full length gene has to be cloned
        starting from minor sequence information (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> bp tag) which
        hampers further functional analysis of the corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, a complex task that requires the complete coding
        sequence.
        Each of these methods clearly has its specific
        advantages, and often different subsets of differentially
        expressed genes are identified employing a certain method.
        For example, cDNAs that are not easily amplified by means
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> are inadequately represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based methods.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> was designed in order to overcome specific
        shortcomings of established differential expression
        analysis technologies used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, e.g. the need to sequence
        all of the examined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or the involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> steps.
        In addition, further cloning of the complete coding
        sequence of the identified genes of interest is facilitated
        by ending up with rather long (e.g. in comparison to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> method) and multiple corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> comprising at
        least part of the coding sequence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> is a digital method
        which identifies and counts the abundance of genes by means
        of restriction fragment fingerprinting.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - principle of the method
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DADA distinguishes</ENAMEX> and identifies genes by their
          specific patterns of cDNA fragments derived from digests
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> different restriction enzymes recognizing
          sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> specific nucleotides. In order to avoid
          detection of other fragments than the desired cDNA
          fragments spanning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>', poly-A end towards the
          nearest upstream restriction site, a special cloning
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> has been devised. It harbors a particular
          combination of cleavage sites that permits cloning of a
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in defined orientation and controlled
          labeling of only the desired fragments with fluorescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dyes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>).
          Double stranded cDNA was synthesized by a reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> reaction using isolated mRNA and an
          anchored oligo dT primer (see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and methods). The
          resulting cDNA pool containing a defined poly A stretch
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> nucleotides was cloned uni-directionally in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>, a cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was constructed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and
          plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from the resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>.
          The part of the vector containing the cDNA fragment
          was labelled by means of a simultaneous
          restriction/ligation reaction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] with double
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stranded</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled oligonucleotides using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bgl I</ENAMEX> site (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) located adjacent to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX> site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'/poly-A end
          of the corresponding mRNA. The labelled oligonucleotide
          was only ligated to the cDNA end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BglI</ENAMEX> restriction
          site due to the non-palindrome nature of the overhang
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In addition, the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BglI</ENAMEX> site located
          within the vector backbone (Bgl I*, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and virtually
          all Bgl I sites (with the exception of sites with CCT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overhang</ENAMEX>) occasionally found in the inserted cDNA
          sequences were not labelled, as the overhangs created by
          the restriction digest were not compatible with the
          overhang of the used oligonucleotides. In comparison, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">labelling of the Bgl</ENAMEX> I was less affected by artifacts
          resulting from labelling of internal restriction sites
          within the cDNA as compared to labeling of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NotI</ENAMEX> site in
          a different vector construct, although <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bgl I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
          more often found in cDNAs compared to Not I sites (data
          not shown).
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step, the plasmids were digested with
          restriction enzymes recognizing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 bp sequences</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Alu I,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bfa I, Dde I Dpn I, Hinf I</ENAMEX>, or Rsa I) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> separate
          reactions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This created labelled cDNA
          fragments comprising <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the most 3</TIMEX>' located site of each
          restriction enzyme, respectively, towards a defined
          stretch of the poly-A tail of the cDNA, a defined part of
          the cloning vector and the labelled oligonucleotide. The
          resulting fragments were separated by polyacrylamide gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ABI377 DNA analyzer</ENAMEX>) and the length of
          the labelled fragments were analyzed by comparison to a
          specially designed internal size marker (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>;
          see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and methods for details). The pattern of
          restriction fragment sizes generated by the procedure was
          characteristic for each individual gene transcript and
          represented an unique fingerprint of the corresponding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. Partial cDNA inserts and empty vectors represent a
          substantial part of cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> that would hamper the
          analysis of restriction fingerprints in standard cloning
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>; e.g. the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cloning vector</ENAMEX> itself would
          generate a characteristic restriction fingerprint that
          would overlay and disturb every analysis. To distinguish
          fragments derived from restriction digests within the
          cDNA inserts from fragments derived from restriction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digests</ENAMEX> within the vector resulting in mixed cDNA/vector
          or vector only sequences, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> cloning vector
          contains an engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> that is free from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> sites used in the fragment analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          and that is longer than the detection window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">900</TIMEX> bp (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>). This extended the
          restriction fingerprint of the empty vector to fragments
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> bp which were not detectable in the analysis. In
          addition, the "restriction site-free" segment of the
          vector guaranteed that all detected fragments within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> window stemmed from restriction sites within
          the cDNAs. If a specific restriction site is not
          contained within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">900 bp</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of a cDNA, no
          detectable fragment was generated.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> variations of the experimental procedure
          for a given cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and the detailed
          description in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Material and Methods</ENAMEX>). In (i) a single
          clone analysis (SCA) the procedure was applied to only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clone at a time, and yielded accurate fingerprints
          for certain genes experimentally. This did not speed up
          the process of expression analysis compared to sequencing
          of clones from cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> approach), but
          generated the fingerprints used for the mixed analysis.
          In (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the mixed analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) the procedure was applied
          to pools of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> cDNA clones multiplexing the plasmid
          preparation, labelling and analysis, thereby speeded up
          the process by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly two</NUMEX> orders of magnitude. In spite
          of the multiplexing, already established fingerprints of
          genes could be unambiguously identified in the
          restriction fragment mixture derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). If the characteristic fingerprint of a certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> was identified in the fragment mixture, at least one
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> of the pool included a vector with the
          corresponding cDNA. Therefore, the frequency of
          occurrence of a fingerprint enabled us to count the
          abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and to calculate expression levels
          from cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> derived from different statuses at a
          high throughput. The high throughput only applied to the
          analysis of the abundance of fingerprints, as in contrast
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCA</ENAMEX>, no new fingerprints could be generated by the
          mixed analysis.
        
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - obtaining patterns from a single clone
          analysis
          We randomly picked single clones of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> from a
          murine wounded skin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and compared the analyzed
          restriction fingerprints with the corresponding,
          experimentally determined cDNA sequence of the vectors.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Vectors</ENAMEX> containing no cDNA inserts produced no signals in
          the detection window of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 to 900</TIMEX> base pairs and
          incomplete or short cDNA inserts yielded only signals of
          fragments derived from restrictions within the cDNA
          sequence. This demonstrated that the restriction free
          region next to the cDNA cloning site fulfills its
          function in repressing misleading fragments and the
          corresponding signals.
          A thorough comparison of the analyzed fragment lengths
          with the corresponding sequences of the clones resulted
          in a good agreement of theoretical and experimental
          fragment length for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> restriction enzymes. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, only those fragments were detected, that were
          derived from the nearest restriction site of the
          corresponding enzyme as judged by sequencing. However, in
          several cases the first <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alu I</ENAMEX> site was not recognized by
          the enzyme despite the use of an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX>-fold excess
          of enzyme units compared to the amount of cDNA,
          indicating site preferences of this restriction enzyme
          that may depend on the context of the recognition
          sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . This did not affect the analysis of
          fingerprints in mixed clone analyses reported below as
          the same site preference was also observed under these
          conditions.
          Another inherent discrepancy is the integer character
          of the predicted values versus the non-integer values
          stemming from the comparison to the size marker. The
          average of the difference of the experimentally analyzed
          length to the calculated length was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.258 bp</NUMEX> (median
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.115 bp</NUMEX>) which means that the analyzed values were
          generally a little longer than the predicted ones. About
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the analyzed lengths differed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX> differed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 0.5 bp</NUMEX> from the predicted
          lengths which by far exceeded the experimental deviations
          in repeated experiments (standard deviation of less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 bp</NUMEX>, see below) and is in accordance to results from
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . These data demonstrated, that
          there is a reproducible but not yet predictable shift of
          the fragments within the polyacrylamide gel run. Together
          with the above mentioned site preference of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AluI</ENAMEX> and
          additional problems like the not well defined
          polyadenylation-site in public database entries, this
          hinders the construction of fingerprints solely based on
          sequence data. Attempts to predict these shifts based on
          the sequence composition of the fragments were not
          successful in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trials.
          Experimentally determined fingerprints from single
          clone analysis could be used for the analysis without any
          of the above mentioned hindrances. The fragment lengths
          from single clone analyses that by chance contained cDNAs
          from the same gene reproduced very accurately. The
          standard deviation from the average value was below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> for fragments below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> and increased with larger
          fragment size. The range in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was accepted as
          being the same as the search value was determined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empirically</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colonies</ENAMEX> of specific genes were mixed into
          different pools of defined clone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX> and the
          detection width was adjusted to be the best compromise
          between not missing any real hits and counting false
          ones. As assumed from the increasing peak width of the
          analyzed fragments and the internal size marker, the
          detection width varied with the length of the fragments
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and methods). The detection range was
          increased above the determined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> bp standard deviation
          especially for the longer fragments. The broader
          detection width that could in principle lead to false
          positive identification of a fingerprint was
          counterbalanced by the fact that the peak density is much
          lower towards the longer fragments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> - proof of concept
          The differences in gene expression following treatment
          of a tissue with an active compound was monitored using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of wound tissue derived from control
          (phosphate buffer saline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, normally healing) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX>, badly healing) treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Steroid</ENAMEX>
          treatment is widely used as a model for impaired wound
          healing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . From each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 37.000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          were analyzed in pools of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> each. The complete
          analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74.000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> required only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> runs on an
          ABI377 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA analyzer</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> each, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          gels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 enzymes</NUMEX> each for the analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX>). All calculated fragment sizes were analyzed and
          stored in a relational database, representing nearly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">500.000</ENAMEX> data points from this analysis alone.
          Applying the restriction fingerprints of the above
          mentioned single clone analysis, we found several genes
          that were up-regulated in wounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are shown that were confirmed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative Real Time RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and represent intriguing
          examples (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cystatin C</ENAMEX> cDNAs contain
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> restriction sites within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 bp</NUMEX> from the poly-A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tail</ENAMEX> (experimental fragment lengths including poly-A tail
          and labelling oligonucleotides: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-2/Cystatin C</ENAMEX>: Dde I:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">196.23/276.11 bp; Alu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">67.51/118.08 bp; Hinf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">349.88/274.51 bp; Bfa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">531.02/270.83 bp; Dpn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">245.02/265.17 bp; Rsa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">254.23/89.18 bp</ENAMEX>, respectively).
          These fingerprints are unambiguously related to their
          cDNA as a search in the complete GenBank database (see
          material and methods) showed only the corresponding
          murine cDNA hits even though the search parameters were
          loosened to account for the above mentioned differences
          in experimentally derived fragment lengths to the real
          sequence.
          Finally, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fingerprints were used for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. The
          fingerprints of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> were used for the search
          of the database from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74.000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">768</NUMEX>
          subsets of the data representing a pool of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          was analyzed by a computer program for the concurrent
          appearance of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> fragments of a specific fingerprint.
          The search for the appearance of the fingerprints from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cystatin C</ENAMEX> resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> counts,
          respectively. Interestingly, the fingerprints were only
          found in datasets/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> from the cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> derived
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DEX</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The concluded induction of both
          transcripts in wounds from badly healing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> compared
          well to quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          In order to explore the limitation of the method we
          also computed all possible restricted fingerprints of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cystatin C</ENAMEX> containing only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> different
          restriction enzymes. Here we obtained the same results
          when we used the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> shortest fragments of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingerprints</ENAMEX>, but misleading results, if we left out for
          example the restriction enzyme that produced the shortest
          fragment. This observation can be easily explained, as
          partial cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> derived from oligo dT synthesis
          can lack the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">5</ENAMEX>' restriction site and include the
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">3</ENAMEX>' restriction site, but never vice versa. If the
          numbers of fragments were reduced to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> shortest ones,
          the results were perturbed by unspecific fingerprints
          that were not derived from the specific cDNAs but were
          erratically composed of fragments derived from different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> within the pool of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. More of those
          comparisons started to reveal significance limits such as
          the number of fragments that should be contained in a
          fingerprint. From the limited amount of comparisons it
          would seem that having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> different fragments in a pattern
          and finding all of them works reliably even with low
          abundant genes like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cystatin C</ENAMEX> that were
          induced to medium abundance by the treatment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 4</NUMEX>
          transcripts within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72.000</NUMEX> analyzed transcripts or
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.05%</NUMEX>).. Finding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 3 to 4</TIMEX> fragments is
          sufficient only for high abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with a
          significant differential expression. E.g., serum albumin
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPR1a</ENAMEX> with abundances of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.5%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and skin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] , could be identified
          and quantified by using <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3</NUMEX> restriction enzymes in the
          corresponding cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
          The clones of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cystatin C</ENAMEX> were examined more
          closely regarding their length. They contained the
          complete cDNA sequence. This is not the case for all
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, but the clones often contain substantial
          parts of the coding regions and they almost always
          prolong the public database cDNA entries toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          end. This supports the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> will also
          facilitate a rapid full length cloning effort after
          identification of interesting genes.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        In conclusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> is a digital method for analyzing
        expression levels based on the counting of restriction
        fingerprints of cDNA clones. It is built around a
        specifically designed cloning vector that suppresses
        misleading fingerprints derived from partial cDNAs or empty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. The method yields quantitative data and absolute
        figures that do not depend on amplification by polymerase
        chain reaction. Compared to the sequencing of cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> (conventional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] ), it is
        substantially faster and more economical. In comparison to
        the SAGE method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] it results in physical cDNA clones
        of substantial length which speed up further analysis.
        Within the limited number of examples, there is a good
        correlation between the clear results from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> and other
        gene expression analysis methods such as quantitative real
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase Protection Assays</ENAMEX>, and various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> procedures (data not shown). A number of
        additional genes with differential regulation discovered by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> and confirmed by independent methods are now under
        investigations for the use as therapeutical targets
        (unpublished observations). Some of the genes identified by
        DADA including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cystatin C</ENAMEX> were neither discovered
        by means of subtractive hybridization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , nor by
        differential display [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , although these methods were
        successfully used in comparable settings in our laboratory
        and lead to a high number of differentially expressed
        genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice versa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> could not detect certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, that were discovered by
        standard methods. As an example, the injury-induced
        differential expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S100A9</ENAMEX> could be detected by
        subtractive hybridization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The DADA fingerprint of
        S100A9 was detected in both analyzed cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        However, as it occurs only once in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, no
        statistical significant differential expression could be
        identified by the DADA method. Only a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
        identified by all methods. In general, the different
        approaches can be seen as complementary rather than
        competitive. The specific findings will certainly vary with
        changes in the completeness and individual execution of the
        respective screens. Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> offers advantages
        with regard to absolute and quantitative data at the level
        of screening.
        As of yet we can only perform digital analyses with
        patterns experimentally analyzed from single clone
        analysis. These fragment lengths reproduce accurately
        enough to search and count them in mixed analyses applying
        rigid queries. The usage of restriction fingerprints
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">computationally</ENAMEX> derived from sequence database entries is
        hampered by the lack of predictability of gel positions
        from sequences and the integer versus non-integer issue.
        The experimental fingerprints, due to the narrower search
        space, allowed for the identification of fingerprints in
        mixtures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> as demonstrated here. The broader
        search space of sequence-based predictions allow only for
        the identification of fingerprints in mixtures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> order of magnitude lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">throughput</ENAMEX> in the case of predicted fingerprints would
        render the method non-superior to others.
        The generation of experimental fingerprints is the
        bottleneck of the procedure as described here. Once the
        fingerprints are generated for a certain species they can
        be rapidly applied in all possible settings. Therefore, we
        are developing improvements of this step. In addition, the
        use of a now available <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> fluorescent dye as a size
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> in sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> should allow for a fast
        correlation between restriction fragment sizes (derived
        from the sequence) and gel run behaviors of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments
        (relative to the size marker). The latter improvement could
        not only lead to a faster generation of experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingerprints</ENAMEX>, but could also supply a large dataset to
        improve the prediction of gel run behaviors of fragments
        based on the sequence composition.
        Another improvement could result from alternative DNA
        separation and detection methods such as capillary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> or mass spectrometry. This could further
        improve the reproducibility of the fragment analysis and
        lead to a reduction of the search space for every fragment.
        As discussed above, this parameter is directly linked to
        the throughput of the method. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DADA</ENAMEX> would
        profit from the higher throughput of capillary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> compared to the gel electrophoresis used in
        this study. On the other hand, values created by mass
        spectrometry are precisely predictable from the sequence of
        DNA fragments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . This would allow for the generation
        of fingerprints from sequence data in silico and speed up
        this limiting step of the procedure.

          by site directed mutagenesis (details available upon

          labeled fragments between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 and 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> were calculated
          from the raw data relative to the ROX size marker by the
          GeneScan program (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>) and exported as
          text files. The data pertaining to the peaks (lane
          number, height, area, colour, calculated length of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fragments</ENAMEX>) were imported into a relational database
          scheme (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> 8.01 relational database management
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>) and integrated with the information on the cDNA

          Analysis of restriction fingerprints derived from
          single clones - single clone analysis (SCA) A computer
          program (written with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Visual Studio</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          software <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX>) was designed that extracted fingerprints
          from the raw data of single clone analysis. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lane,
          the peak for each restriction enzyme was chosen, that had
          the maximum height (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NewHeight</ENAMEX>) after applying the
          following empirically determined formula in order to
          account for the broadening in peak shape and the
          resulting lower peak height that goes along with
          increasing numbers of base pairs: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NewHeight</ENAMEX> =
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MeasuredHeight /</ENAMEX> ((<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CalculatedBasePairs / - Denominator</ENAMEX>) +
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addend</ENAMEX>), with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denominator</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addend</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>. The
          corresponding calculated lengths of the fragments were
          stored as fingerprints in the database.
        
        
          Calculation of the abundance of fingerprints in
          mixed clone analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>)
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> computer program was designed that analyzed
          the datasets from the mixed analysis for the frequency of
          occurrence of the stored fingerprints. Each dataset
          derived from a pool of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> complex fragment
          mixtures in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> corresponding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gels</ENAMEX>) was queried for the concurrent occurrence of the
          peaks / fragments of each fingerprint, respectively (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). As an example, for a certain cDNA fingerprint
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the peak</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCA</ENAMEX> for restriction enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DdeI</ENAMEX> was
          determined at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">326,5 bp</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lane in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX> there are
          multiple peaks stemming from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DdeI digestion</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67.4</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98.5,.....326.7....500.1..</NUMEX>.). The computer program
          checked if the peak for Dde I was contained in the
          complex peak mixture derived from the Dde I digest,
          considering a certain bandwidth. In the example above,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">326.7 bp</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX> would be considered as a hit. The
          computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> did the same for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> restriction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX>. When all peaks are simultaneously present in one
          dataset from a pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> the counter for this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">fingerprint/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> goes up by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. It is possible to adjust
          the program to query the data with only a subset of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          restriction enzymes of the fingerprints.
          The empirical determined allowed bandwidth for a peak
          to be counted was set to the following parameters
          fragments from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 bp: bandwidth +-0.5 bp, 100-300</ENAMEX>
