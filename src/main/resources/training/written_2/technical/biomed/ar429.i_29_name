        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Antecedent</ENAMEX> infection with many different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> is
        often associated with the development of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, but the pathogenic mechanisms involved, if any,
        are unknown. Most of the microbes associated with
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> have been viruses, particularly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytomegalovirus</ENAMEX> (CMV), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein-Barr</ENAMEX> virus, and
        varicella-zoster virus. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> has been associated with the
        increased production of rheumatoid factor, antiphospholipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, cold agglutinins, antimyosin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>,
        anti-endothelial cell antibodies, and antiganglioside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study found an increased incidence of
        anti-CMV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with systemic lupus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erythematosus</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        Neutralizing antibodies induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> are directed
        primarily against the major envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX> B (gB). Antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> gB share some
        homology with rheumatoid factor, thus providing a
        theoretical relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> infection and
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . An adenovirus-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gB</ENAMEX> construct
        vaccine administered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> induced a statistically
        significant increase in the production of antibodies to
        U1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in both normal and autoimmune-prone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . recently reported an
        increased incidence of antibodies to Sm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> and
        antibodies to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) among naturally
        CMV-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, as well as an increase in
        antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        To confirm the findings of Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , we evaluated sera
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> either naturally infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> or
        immunized with the live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">attenuated</ENAMEX> Towne strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> for
        the presence of antibodies to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> antigens: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, and
        U1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kD. We also assessed the correlation between
        production of antibodies to gB and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Subjects
          Anonymously coded serum specimens had been stored at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-80°C.</ENAMEX> These were preimmunization screening sera from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          normal healthy adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> who volunteered for a Towne
          vaccine study. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX> naturally seropositive and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          seronegative sera were used. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were aged between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 and 53 years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were not
          recorded). Also included were postimmunization serial
          sera from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> normal healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who had received
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> plaque forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of the live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">attenuated</ENAMEX> Towne
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> as a single subcutaneous injection. Following
          immunization, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> gB. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cent</NUMEX> of the CMV
          seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seronegative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX>; the remainder were
          Afro-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Screening for anti-CMV antibodies
          Sera were tested for the presence or absence of IgG
          antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> by either latex agglutination (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMVScan</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>, Sparks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) or by enzyme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoassay</ENAMEX> (EIA) as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Detection of antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> and RNP
          An indirect, noncompetitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> was used for both Sm
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX> antigens to detect IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. Microplate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wells</ENAMEX> coated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> bound human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, which was
          subsequently bound by an enzyme-labeled conjugate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and quantitated colorimetrically (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varelisa</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia & Upjohn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freiburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). Sera were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">diluted 1:101</ENAMEX> for both assays.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> used in this assay was purified from
          calf thymus. The human recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX> antigens used
          included the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> k, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U1A</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antigens</ENAMEX>. For both Sm
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, specific quantitative values for each specimen
          were obtained by extrapolation of optical densities (OD)
          from a standard curve derived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> points. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX>,
          the negative/positive cutoff value was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IU</ENAMEX>/ml serum or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, the negative/positive cutoff value
          was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 IU</NUMEX>/ml serum or OD = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Detection of antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> kD
          To detect the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibodies</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
          kD ribonuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, both immunoblotting and EIA
          methods were used as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
          Each sample was tested by immunoblot against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cell
          lysates with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:100</ENAMEX> dilution of sera, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> against
          a bacterially produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> kD fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">comprised residues 1-205</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">u1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> assays were
          performed using a serum dilution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> and were run
          taking the average OD of duplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> results
          were repeated for any samples where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> of the
          duplicate wells varied by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 0.05</NUMEX>, and for all
          samples with positive results by either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EIA</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblot</ENAMEX>. In cases where discrepant results were
          obtained between immunoblot and EIA testing, sera were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblotted</ENAMEX> using a more sensitive technique against
          both intact and apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat</ENAMEX> lysates, as previously
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] using sera diluted <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:5000</ENAMEX>.
          Negative immunoblot and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> results demonstrated the
          absence of significant titers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibodies</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kD</ENAMEX>. Positive results on immunoblot and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> or a positive
          result on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tests and a positive
          immunoblot for apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> kD demonstrated the
          presence of antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX>. A positive immunoblot
          result that was not confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> or follow-up
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblot</ENAMEX> would probably reflect recognition of an
          antigen other than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kD with similar electrophoretic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motility</ENAMEX> (i.e. a negative result). An isolated positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> was an indeterminate finding; the weaker the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>, the less likely it was to be valid. A
          positive EIA result was an OD value above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.100</NUMEX>. If
          either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> or the immunoblot produced positive
          results, the more sensitive apoptotic assay was used to
          verify the presence of antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX>. The
          sensitivity of these assays has been previously
          established [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Detection of antibodies to gB
          Quantitative levels of antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> gB were
          measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> in all seropositive sera as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The OD value obtained for the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1600</ENAMEX>
          dilution for each serum was used for statistical
          calculations. The gB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> used in this assay was a
          recombinant derivative of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CMV</ENAMEX> strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Towne</ENAMEX> gB
          produced as a secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> hamster ovary
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The recombinant gB includes amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">676</NUMEX> of the extracellular domain. The proteolytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> site at amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 437</ENAMEX> was blocked by the
          site-specific mutation of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues 433</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">434,</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">436</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Statistical calculations
          Comparisons were carried out using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> analysis.
          Regression analysis was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Plot</ENAMEX>
          (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.02</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jandel Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rafael</ENAMEX>, CA,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> and RNP
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s sera to establish a
          negative/positive cutoff value, none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sera</ENAMEX> tested
          contained detectable levels of antibodies to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sm</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX>, using the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> plus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          standard deviations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seronegative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sera</ENAMEX> to establish a negative/positive cutoff value, none
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive sera were positive, one of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seronegative sera was positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.422</NUMEX>), and none
          of the sera from the vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> were positive.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, using the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seronegative sera to establish a
          negative/positive cutoff value, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> CMV
          seronegative sera were positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.22</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive sera were positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.26 and 0.25</NUMEX>), and none of the sera from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine recipients</ENAMEX> were positive.
          To determine whether there was a statistically
          significant association between levels of antibodies to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> gB and the levels of antibodies to Sm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> or RNP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>, a simple linear regression analysis of gB OD
          values versus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP OD</ENAMEX> values for sera from CMV
          seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and for sera from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> after immunization was performed. No
          significant correlations were found (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Antibodies against <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> kD
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> kD as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, only one
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sera</ENAMEX> tested was positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.121</NUMEX>). That one
          serum was negative using an immunoblot with apoptotic
          Jurkat cells. Using an immunoblot, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> sera were
          positive and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sera</ENAMEX> were weakly positive. None of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> weakly positive sera were positive using an
          immunoblot with apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cells, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sera positive by immunoblot were also positive
          using an immunoblot with apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cells. No sera
          was positive both by immunoblot and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX>. There was no
          significant difference for the rate of positivity between
          sera obtained for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and CMV
          seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recipients</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The present study was designed to confirm the report of
        Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . They reported that, among the
        sera of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> normal healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 CMV</TIMEX> seronegative), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX> contained antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
        contained antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sm</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> contained antibodies to
        U1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . also observed that the
        frequency of autoantibodies to each of the antigens
        occurred more frequently among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive subjects
        than among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>
        seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, they observed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX>) subjects
        had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>) had antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sm</ENAMEX>, and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>) had antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . If Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . used a negative/positive
        cutoff value of the mean plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> standard deviations
        then, overall, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> of their sera contained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantibodies</ENAMEX>.
        We could not reproduce the data of Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the study of
        Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . were similar to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>;
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> female and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX>. Although there are only a few
        published reports on the frequency of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> in
        normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, those published reports all find a
        frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 0 and 3%</NUMEX>, similar to those reported in
        the present study [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study of over
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> healthy pregnant and nonpregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> found
        that none had IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sm</ENAMEX> or RNP. IgM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, however, were detected in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> or less of
        subjects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">predominantly IgG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>, and to a
        lesser extent IgM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        inactive autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> are most likely to have IgM
        antibodies to these antigens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . Both the present
        study and that of Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . measured IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to
        these nuclear antigens.
        Several factors may account for the difference between
        our results and those of Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . Differences in assay methods
        or antigens could be important. This is suggested by the
        fact that the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>0.5</NUMEX>) observed by Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> and RNP EIA
        assays was significantly higher than the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OD</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.15</NUMEX>)
        observed in the present study. Another possibility relates
        to the negative/positive cutoff value used. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        antigens, Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EIA</ENAMEX> assays and
        established their negative/positive cutoff value using the
        mean plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seronegative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sera</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . This appears to have resulted in a
        negative/positive cutoff value significantly lower than
        that observed in the present study using either the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer's</ENAMEX> recommended cutoff value or our own cutoff
        value established with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> seronegative sera. To detect
        antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX>, Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . used only an EIA assay. Using
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> assay, we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> sera contained
        antibodies to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Another factor that may account for the difference
        between our results and those of Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . is the prevalence of the HLA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">antigen DR4.</ENAMEX> This HLA type occurs among <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of patients
        with autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX>, but its
        prevalence in the normal healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is only about
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 30</NUMEX> ] . Hence, if the association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> DR4
        and the presence of antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> kD exists for
        healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and if, due to selection bias, our
        population contained very few (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>) DR4-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of Newkirk 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . contained a very high (≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>)
        prevalence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DR4</NUMEX>-positive subjects, this could account for
        the observed differences. This possibility, however, seems
        very improbable.
        In another study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newkirk</ENAMEX> and coworkers also observed
        that a recombinant gB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>, which expressed the gB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Towne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>, induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> gB
        when administered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> gB induces
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies crossreactive</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . If this is
        the case, it predicts a correlation between levels of
        antibodies to gB and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX> in sera. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, neither
        the present study or that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newkirk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        found such a correlation. This indicates that either there
        is no such crossreactivity or that, if it exists, it occurs
        very infrequently or only to a few epitopes. It is also
        possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice Newkirk</ENAMEX> and coworkers used were
        genetically primed to produce autoantibodies in response to
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>.
        Whether viruses cause autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is
        controversial. If they do cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, several mechanisms
        may explain the association between viruses and autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. To stimulate a complete autoimmune response, two
        signals (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> specific and one not antigen
        specific), are necessary [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The best described
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific mechanism is molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mimicry</ENAMEX>, whereby
        some component of the offending virus resembles the host
        structure on a molecular level, thus providing the template
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> formation that may crossreact with
        self-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. Several of the nonantigen-specific signals
        include costimulatory cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers</ENAMEX> as well as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of a multitude of cytokines. Theoretically,
        viruses may play a role in eliciting either or both of
        these signals.
        Infection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> is ubiquitous within the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 100%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> eventually acquire a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> infection. On the contrary, autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is
        relatively rare, occurring in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. If CMV was a frequent inducer of
        autoantibodies, and by implication an autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
        both the frequency of autoantibodies in disease-free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and the incidence of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> would be much higher than observed by
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and ourselves. It is not excluded, however,
        that a low frequency of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> may be
        infrequently but significantly associated with CMV
        infection. To establish this will require testing of a
        large number of sera. For example, testing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 700</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sera</ENAMEX> will be required to determine whether an autoantibody
        frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seronegative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is a significant
        difference.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We failed to detect antibodies to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sm</ENAMEX> or RNP in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> infected with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CMV</ENAMEX> or in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> vaccinated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Towne</ENAMEX> strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>.
        Likewise, regression analysis of levels of antibodies to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> gB, the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> formed after natural infection
        or active immunization, failed to demonstrate a correlation
        with the levels of antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNP</ENAMEX>. With
        regards to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U1-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kD</ENAMEX>, which may be a more
        sensitive indicator of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the sera from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> seropositive subject contained these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and none of the sera of the vaccinees contained
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. These results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection
        induces these autoantibodies infrequently and that
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection is
        probably rare.
