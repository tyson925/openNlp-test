        The dorsal striatum is a massive nucleus in the basal
        forebrain that plays a pivotal role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">modulating</TIMEX> motor
        activity and higher cognitive function. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 90%</NUMEX>
        of all neurons in the striatum - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>] - belong to
        an unusual type 'of inhibitory projection cell referred to
        as medium spiny neurons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Striatal neurons are
        divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major subpopulations (patch and matrix),
        that have somewhat different gene expression profiles and
        have different patterns of pre- and postsynaptic
        connections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Numbers of medium spiny neurons and ratios of these and
        less numerous striatal interneurons are critical variables
        that influence motor performance and aspects of cognition.
        In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Huntington disease</ENAMEX> the loss of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-30%</NUMEX> of the
        normal complement of medium spiny neurons leads to distinct
        movement disorder in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>
        models [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . The subset of genes that normally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of
        striatal neurons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] are therefore of considerable
        importance in ensuring adaptive behavior at maturity.
        In this study we use a forward genetic approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>] to begin to map and characterize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the subset
        of normally polymorphic genes that specifically modulate
        the production and survival of striatal neurons. Our
        analysis of the neurogenetic control of striatal cell
        populations relies on the combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complementary
        quantitative approaches. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these, complex trait
        analysis, is a comparatively new genetic method that makes
        it possible to map individual loci that underlie polygenic
        traits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> consists of a set of unbiased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stereological</ENAMEX> procedures that can be used to obtain cell
        counts accurately and efficiently from large numbers of
        cases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>].
        From a technical point of view the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">striatum</ENAMEX> has
        several advantages that make it an excellent target for
        complex trait analysis of the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. First, it is a
        large, cytoarchitectonically distinct region comprising
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5-6%</NUMEX> of the volume of the mouse brain.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the dorsal striatum has a comparatively homogenous
        cellular composition, potentially reducing the number of
        quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect striatal neuron
        number. Finally, recent experiments on the molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of telencephalic development have highlighted a
        number of genes that influence neuron proliferation and
        differentiation of the striatum and other neighboring
        forebrain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        We report here both neuroanatomic and genetic
        quantitative evidence that the size of the striatum and the
        number of neurons contained within it are modulated
        independently.

             . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> strains were chosen to represent low, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid</TIMEX>,
            and high brain weights (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). Brain weights of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two high</NUMEX> strains, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD5</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">540 Â± 9 mg</NUMEX> SEM) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BALB</ENAMEX>/cJ
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">527 Â± 13 mg</NUMEX>), are significantly greater (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < .001</ENAMEX>)
            than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">476 Â± 5 mg</NUMEX>). Similarly, the
            brain weights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">395 Â± 5 mg</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">403 Â± 5</ENAMEX>

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < .001</ENAMEX>). As anticipated,
            differences in striatal volume correspond well with
            differences in brain weight and volume. The striata of
            BXD5 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31.0 Â± 0.9 mm 3</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB/cJ</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32.5 Â± 1.6 mm 3</NUMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are significantly larger (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < .001</ENAMEX>) than those
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23.6 Â± 0.6 mm 3</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21.7 Â± 1.0 mm 3</NUMEX>),
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22.8 Â± 0.6 mm 3</NUMEX>) strains.

              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Density</ENAMEX>. 
             There is a significant difference among strains in
            the packing density of striatal neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.001</NUMEX>
            for all comparisons). A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX> has a higher mean density
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84,800</NUMEX> Â± 3,500 neurons<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/mm 3</ENAMEX>) than all strains other

            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">neurons/mm 3</ENAMEX>) do not differ significantly from each
            other, but do differ from all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>. C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73,100</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,700</NUMEX>) differs from all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the
            exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA/2J. Inbred</ENAMEX> strains with smaller
            striatal volumes have higher neuronal packing densities
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>).
            
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Striatal Neuron Number</ENAMEX>. 
             As a result of the reciprocal relation between
            volume and density, there is no significant difference
            in striatal neuron number among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> strains. Total
            striatal neuron numbers ranges over a very modest range
            - from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.72 Â± .015 million</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> to a
            high of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.93 Â± .035 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD5</TIMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Correlational Statistics</ENAMEX>
            Our comparisons are based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> strains, and one
            consequence of this modest sample size is that sampling
            errors and intraclass correlations may bias the results
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. We therefore also analyzed a larger sample of
            genetically heterogeneous ABF2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intercross animals</ENAMEX> (an
            F2 intercross between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BXD5</ENAMEX>). We first
            determined that the distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> dependent
            measures were normally distributed (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>), before
            subjecting the data to correlational analysis. In this
            set of animals brain weight correlates significantly
            with striatal volume ( 
            r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.82</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < .001</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). Striatal
            volume is negatively correlated with neuron-packing
            density overall ( 
            r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.32</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>, 
            P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .05</NUMEX>), again indicating
            that the greater the striatal volume, the lower the
            neuron-packing density (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>). Despite this
            relationship, the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of striatal neurons
            correlates positively with striatal volume in this
            larger sample ( 
            r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.60</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < .001; Fig 3C</ENAMEX>). In this
            crucial respect, results from the genetically
            heterogeneous F2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> differ from those of inbred
            strains.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL Analysis</ENAMEX>
          The analysis in this section is focused principally on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> traits: striatal volume (absolute and residual
          values), and striatal neuron number (also absolute and
          residual values). Residuals for these traits were
          computed for both traits to minimize the influence of
          brain weight. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional traits were mapped to assess
          specificity of the effects of putative QTL-bearing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, namely brain weight and non-striatal brain
          weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This last parameter was estimated by
          subtracting the estimated bilateral striatal weight
          (assuming a specific gravity of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>) from that of the
          whole brain.
          The strongest linkage was found between variation in
          striatal volume and an interval on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> between
          the markers 
          D10Mit194 at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> cM and 
          D10Mit209 at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">49 cM.</TIMEX> The likelihood
          ratio statistic - a value that can be read as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> - peaks in this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> cM interval at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</NUMEX> and is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a P value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.00016</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>),
          equivalent to a LOD score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4A</ENAMEX>). The
          genome-wide probability of achieving a linkage of this
          strength by chance is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>. This locus accounts for
          as much as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the total phenotypic variance in
          striatal volume and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 50%</NUMEX> of the genotypic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.39</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alleles</ENAMEX> in this Chr 10
          interval that are inherited from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the BXD5</TIMEX> parental strain
          contribute to a significantly larger striatum than do
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> inherited from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">A</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Mean</ENAMEX> bilateral volume
          corrected for shrinkage for the 
          AA genotype at 
          D10Mit186 ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25.3 Â± 1.3 mm</NUMEX> 3whereas
          that for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> genotypes are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29.1 Â± 0.7 mm</NUMEX> 3and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30.0 Â± 0.5 mm 3</NUMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 and 11</NUMEX>), respectively. The
          insignificant difference between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> genotypes suggests that the 
          B allele is dominant. BXD5 is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> inbred strain initially generated by crossing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strains C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA/2J.</ENAMEX> Most of the proximal part of
          Chr <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD5</TIMEX> is derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX>, but a short
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">interval</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 40 and 50 cM</TIMEX> is derived exclusively from
          C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/6J. This</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> region corresponds to the peak
          LRS score. We estimate a single 
          B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> inherited from the BXD5
          parent increases striatal volume by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mm 3</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chr 10</ENAMEX> interval has an appreciable effect on brain
          size. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Variance</ENAMEX> in brain weight minus that of the striatum
          is associated with an LRS of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.2</NUMEX> in the same location
          between 
          D10Mit106 and 
          D10Mit186 . Each 
          B allele adds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-30</NUMEX> mg to total
          brain weight. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chr 10</ENAMEX> locus clearly has pleiotropic
          effects on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, but its effect on the striatum is
          more intense. Nonetheless, until we know more about the
          scope of effects, we have opted to give this <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chr 10</ENAMEX> locus
          a generic name, 
          Brain size control 10a ( 
          Bsc10a ). The specific striatal
          component of the 
          Bsc10a was analyzed by mapping the
          residual striatal values that corrects for differences in
          brain volume. The specific effect of a 
          B allele is reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 mm</NUMEX> 3to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> mm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRS</ENAMEX> is reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX>, a value
          which still has a point-wise probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 0.03</NUMEX>,
          indicating a significant independent effect.
          We identified a second strong candidate interval on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distal Chr</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> that may modulate striatal neuron number.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRS</ENAMEX> peaks at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15.0</NUMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOD</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.26</NUMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our more
          distal markers ( 
          D19Mit123 , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> cM, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.00055</NUMEX>). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mapping neuron</ENAMEX> number we actually used the residual cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as a trait, and we are therefore confident
          that this interval has a selective, although not
          necessarily exclusive, effect on numbers of neurons in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">striatum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>). Each 
          B allele increases the population
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200,000</NUMEX> cells. The 
          AA genotype has an average residual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116,000</NUMEX> less than the mean (i.e., a
          residual of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-116,000</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>), the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> heterozygotes have an average of
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> neurons ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>), and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homozygotes</ENAMEX> have an average of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">290,000 neurons</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Corresponding absolute
          numbers of striatal neurons for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotypes</ENAMEX> are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2 million</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed genome-wide
          probability of this locus is at the threshold for
          declaring a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.035</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01 two</NUMEX>-tailed for an

          chromosomal interval has an LRS score remotely as high as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distal Chr</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>. The next highest LRS value is only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX> on

          D1Mit65 and has a point-wise
          probability that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> times higher than the Chr 19
          interval. Given these findings we have given the distal
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> interval the name 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Striatal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neuron Number 19a</ENAMEX> ( 
          Stnn19a ). Allelic differences in
          this interval account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 30%</NUMEX> of the total variance
          in striatal neuron number. As the heritability of this
          trait is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.64</NUMEX>, this trait can be said to account for over
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the genetic variance. Residual neuron counts have
          a higher LRS than the total neuron counts (LRS of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.0</NUMEX>
          vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.9</NUMEX>). This indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chr 19</ENAMEX> interval is
          likely to have selective effect on the striatum.
          Consistent with this hypothesis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRS</ENAMEX> for brain weight
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">distal</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chr 19</ENAMEX> is under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, and weights of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          genotypes average <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">480 Â± 5 mg</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Linkage on Chr 19</ENAMEX> is not
          affected at all by remapping with control for the
          striatal volume locus on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Chr 10</TIMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chr 10 and Chr</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          intervals do not interact or cooperate in controlling
          striatal volume or neuron number.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Between-strain variability
          Variation in the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> regions and cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> is already known to be substantial in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">striatum</ENAMEX> and in many other regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. The number
          of striatal cholinergic neurons, for example, varies <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> BXD RI lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Interestingly, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> appears to be unrelated to susceptibility to
          haloperidol-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalepsy</ENAMEX>. The volume of the granule
          cell layer of the dentate gyrus varies <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 40-80%</NUMEX>
          among different inbred strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] .
          More recent experiments using stereologic techniques have
          reported substantial variation in both neuron number and
          volume of the pyramidal and dentate cell layers of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Granule cell numbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NZB/BINJ</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37-118%</NUMEX> greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and
          differences in volume were even larger (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 150%</NUMEX> larger
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2</ENAMEX> as compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>). There is
          also substantial among-strain variation in other
          structures in the nervous system including the nucleus of
          the solitary tract [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], the spinal nucleus of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bulbocavernosus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], and retinal ganglion cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>]. Taken together, these results point to a high level
          of variability in neuron number in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          Based on these findings, we anticipated significant
          differences in the striatum of inbred strains. We did
          find large strain differences in volume. What was
          surprising was that in our set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> highly divergent
          strains the differences in volume were not matched by
          significant differences in neuron number. There was in
          fact a strong inverse relationship between striatal
          volume and neuron-packing density that led to a
          remarkably stabile neuron number. The variation in
          neuron-packing density with volume contrasts somewhat
          with the report of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abusaad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], who
          found no significant differences (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.06</NUMEX>) in neuronal
          packing density in the dentate gyrus cell layers of the
          hippocampus among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mouse strains that they
          examined, but did see a significant difference in the
          pyramidal cell layers. A recent report demonstrates a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>
          range of granule <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> packing density among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> BXD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> inbred lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>], a finding supporting the
          notion that packing density varies significantly among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">mouse strains</ENAMEX>.
          These data suggest that principles that govern the
          relationship between neuronal volume and neuron-packing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> may differ between the striatum and the other CNS
          regions. The striatum may be a special case - a region in
          which numbers of medium spiny neurons is more tightly
          regulated than neuron <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in some other regions.
          It could also be that measuring specific neuronal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX> would demonstrate a greater amount of variance
          than we currently report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Given the relatively
          small number of strains that we have sampled, our
          hypothesis of lower variation in striatal cell
          populations requires a more extensive test, a problem
          which we are now pursuing using the large numbers of
          strains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mouse Brain Library</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mbl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Verification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> Results
          We have quantified the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of striatal neurons
          on both sides of the brain in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> cases total. This is a
          large sample from the perspective of stereological
          analysis of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CNS</ENAMEX>, but from the perspective of
          gene mapping and quantitative genetics this is, of
          course, a modest-sized sample size and one that will need
          to be treated as a starting point for more refined
          genetic analysis. Nonetheless, we have succeeded in
          mapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> locus, 
          Bsc10a , which modulates striatal
          volume with a genome-wide significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>. We
          have also discovered linkage on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chr</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> to variation in
          the total number of striatal neurons. These mapping data
          are concordant with our strain comparison and
          collectively suggest that there is apparently no
          significant genetic correlation between striatal volume
          and neuron number. To confirm and refine our genetic
          dissection of the striatum we plan to analyze the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AXB</ENAMEX> and
          BXA recombinant inbred (RI) strains generated by crossing
          A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX> This large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> set has already been
          processed and regenotyped and is now part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brain Library</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mbl</ENAMEX>.organd
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nervenet</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/papers/bxn.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>). An analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">RI strains</ENAMEX> can be quickly extended by generating F1
          intercrosses between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> and the subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> strains
          that have recombinations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> intervals on Chrs 10
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Isogenic</ENAMEX> sets of RI-backcross progeny can be used
          to test specific models of gene action, for example, the
          dominance of the 
          B allele at 
          Bsc10a .
          A major goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> mapping is to define loci that
          affect critical phenotypes with sufficient precision to
          generate short lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generating</ENAMEX> lists
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> will soon be greatly facilitated
          by more complete and better annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human
          sequence databases combined with information on gene
          expression profiles of whole brain and striatum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
          Once chromosomal positions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> have been
          determined to a precision of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cM</ENAMEX>, reducing the
          probability that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> actually represents a cluster of
          linked genes, it will become appropriate to assess
          strengths of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> using transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and by
          sequence comparisons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>].
          Interval mapping places the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> for 
          Bsc10a in the central portion of
          Chr <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in proximity with a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known to
          affect brain development. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is 
          Grk2 , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
          ionotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor genes</ENAMEX> that is thought to
          play a role in modulating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Huntington disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. In
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> type act to
          indirectly down-regulate synaptic activity in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">striatum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. Another gene that falls into the 
          Bsc10a interval is 
          Macs , the gene encoding the
          myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>). This molecule is important in cerebral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. MARCKS-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have a high incidence
          of exencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and
          abnormalities other forebrain structure including
          widespread neocortical ectopias [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>]. The
          MARCKS-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gene</ENAMEX> is expressed in the striatum
          during early brain development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>].
          The location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTL</ENAMEX> modulating striatal neuron
          number to the distal part of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> places it in
          proximity to a number of genes that have been recently
          been shown to be important factors in telencephalic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, particularly 
          Vax1 . 
          Vax1 is a homeobox-containing gene
          and is a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emx</ENAMEX> and 
          Not genes. 
          Vax1 is localized during
          development to the anterior ventral forebrain, and is
          expressed in the striatum during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
          This molecule also has an important role in axon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX>: both the anterior portion of the corpus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">callosum</ENAMEX> and the optic chiasm are malformed or absent in 
          Vax1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]. In
          addition, 
          Vax1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacts</ENAMEX> with several
          molecules including sonic hedgehog, 
          Pax2 , 
          Pax6 , and 
          Rx that are known to be important
          during development of the basal forebrain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 50</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Brain volume and neuron number
          It has previously been shown that differences in brain
          weight are proportional to total brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content and
          consequently to total CNS cell number [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51, 52</TIMEX>]. For this
          reason, brain weight has been suggested to be a good
          surrogate measure for total cell number in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, as in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. Moreover, previous work has demonstrated a
          tight link between regional brain volume and neuron
          number [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55</TIMEX>], which implies that volumetric measures
          reliably estimate neuron number. With this literature in
          mind, we expected that our measures of striatal volume
          would predict neuron number in this nucleus. With the
          inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, however, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> with small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">striata</ENAMEX> (A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX>) had virtually the same number of neurons as
          those with large striata (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BALB/cJ</ENAMEX>). This result indicates
          that at least for the striatum, volume is not a reliable
          indicator of neuron number, and that they may be two
          independent traits. This conclusion is bolstered at the
          genetic level by our report of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> for
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> morphologic phenotypes. Taken together with
          previous reports [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52 53</NUMEX> ] , we speculate that while
          total neuron number in the cerebrum may relate to total
          brain weight, the relationship of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variables is
          flexible at the regional level.
        
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Subjects
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thirty-four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that we analyzed were
          common inbred strains that were selected to sample a wide
          range of brain weights, and by expectation, striatal
          volumes. Low brain weight strains included <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid</ENAMEX> and high brain weight
          strains include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB/cJ</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BXD5</TIMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, formally this recombinant
          inbred strain is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BXD-5/Ty</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> was removed from the analysis because
          values for striatal neuron number were anomalous with Z
          scores <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.5</NUMEX>.
          To map <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> that modulate variation in CNS size and
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> we used an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F2</ENAMEX> intercross between a
          strain with low brain weight (A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX>) and a strain with high
          brain weight (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BXD5</NUMEX>). A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">518</NUMEX> of these ABDF2
          progeny were generated, but for this study we selected a
          subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> cases, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> were fully genotyped (see
          below). The sample included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the lowest and
          highest quartiles, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> cases within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 SD</TIMEX> of the mean
          brain weight. We therefore measured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> representing
          the full range of brain weights (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>). The ABDF2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercross</ENAMEX> has been used previously to map <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> that
          modulate total brain weight [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>] and cerebellar volume [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BXD5</NUMEX> strain used as the paternal strain in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercross</ENAMEX> is a recombinant inbred strain that was
          derived by crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> lines of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>]. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ABDF2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">progeny</ENAMEX> are a mixture of three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX>). However,
          at any given locus there will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> alleles, 
          A and 
          B , or 
          A and 
          D . All stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jax</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> stock. The F2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> ranged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">143 days</TIMEX>. The standard inbred strains ranged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51 to 365 days</TIMEX>. We studied approximately equal numbers of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Histological Preparation
          All brains analyzed in this study are part of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mouse Brain Library</ENAMEX> (MBL). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBL</ENAMEX> is both a physical and
          Internet resource. High-resolution digital images of
          sections from all cases are available at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mbl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were anesthetized deeply with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avertin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.25%</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,2,2</NUMEX>-tribromoethanol and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8%</NUMEX> 
          tert -pentyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> ml ip) and perfused through the left ventricle
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate buffered</ENAMEX> (PB) saline (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>)
          followed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.25% glutaraldehyde/1.0%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.1 M PB</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.40</NUMEX>) over a period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 4</NUMEX> min. An
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-ml of double-strength fixative (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">glutaraldehyde/2</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.0%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde) was injected for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at an increased flow rate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> with brain
          was placed a vial with the last fixative and stored at
          4Â°C until dissection.
          Following dissection, the brains were weighed
          immediately. Brains were subsequently shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beth</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deaconess Medical Center</ENAMEX>. They were immersed in
          fresh <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> formalin for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one week</TIMEX> before being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embedding</ENAMEX> in celloidin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. Brains were cut on a
          sliding microtome at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î¼m</NUMEX> in either horizontal or
          coronal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. Free-floating sections were stained with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cresylechtviolett</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> series of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> section
          were mounted on slides and coverslipped (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://mbl.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/procedures/tissue_proc.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">htmlfor</ENAMEX> further
          details).
        
        
          Histologic Phenotypes
          
            Total Brain Volume
            To accurately estimate histological shrinkage for
            each brain in the sample, we determined the volume of
            the entire brain and took a ratio of this value to the
            original fixed brain weight. Brain volumes were
            determined from serial sections using point counting
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cavalieri</ENAMEX>'s rule. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High-resolution</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼m/pixel</ENAMEX>)
            images of entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brain Library</ENAMEX>, and point counting was performed on
            these images using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.55</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://rsb.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">info</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/nih-</ENAMEX>imageand an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Macintosh</ENAMEX>
            computer <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apple</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. If the criteria for
            using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cavalieri</ENAMEX>'s estimator were not met (due to
            missing or damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>), a measurement method
            involving piecewise parabolic integration was employed
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>]. Subsequent measurements of striatal volume and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuron</ENAMEX> packing density were corrected for volumetric
            shrinkage. The average shrinkage was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.2 Â± 0.4%</NUMEX> (a
            mean residual volume of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.8%</NUMEX>).
          
          
            Striatal Volume
            Volume of the striatum was also determined from
            serial section analysis using point counting and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cavalieri</ENAMEX>'s rule. Images from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
            captured at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> x and were projected onto a video
            monitor. Point counting was performed as above. Volume
            was computed separately for the right and left sides
            and corrected for shrinkage.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Striatal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neuron-Packing Density</ENAMEX> and Neuron
            Number
            Neurons were counted using the 3-dimensional
            counting software of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rakic</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. A series
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> contiguous counting boxes (each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 x 65 x 20 Î¼m</NUMEX>)
            aligned in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 x 2 matrix</NUMEX> were placed randomly within
            the striatum, and those neurons the nucleoli of which
            were in focus were counted as described previously [
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61, 62</TIMEX>]. This large functional counting box (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">80 x 195 x</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼m</NUMEX>) was chosen to minimize sampling variance by
            ensuring an equitable sampling of striatal patch and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these large fields were counted in each
            of the hemispheres. Neuron-packing density was computed
            as the number of cells/mm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3corrected</ENAMEX> for shrinkage.
            Multiplying the volume of the striatum by its
            cell-packing density permitted estimation of the number
            of neurons in that nucleus.
          
          
            Reliability
            We determined test-retest reliability by having an
            observer blindly re-measure striatal volume on a subset
            of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> brains from the collection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> not only
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-measured the striatal volume from the same series of
            sections as the original measure, but also estimated
            volume from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> sections offset
            by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sections from the previous series. The
            correlations among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estimations</ENAMEX> ranged from
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.95</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.99</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < .05</ENAMEX>), indicating a high degree of
            reliability for this dependent variable.
            We assessed reliability of our estimates of neuronal
            numbers by having an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> blindly re-estimate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">neuron</ENAMEX> number in the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> brains above. The
            intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> correlation for this measure was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.81</NUMEX> (P
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .05</NUMEX>), which is similar to the reliability seen in
            previous estimates of neuron number [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40</TIMEX>].

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regression Analysis of Trait Values</ENAMEX>
            The unadjusted striatal estimates vary to a large
            extent as a result of variation in total brain weight.
            However, one of our goals in this study is to map QTLs
            with relatively intense effects on the striatum. For
            this reason we also have corrected all of the
            parameters used in the mapping analysis for variation
            in brain weight using linear regression analysis. We
            have mapped data with and without compensation for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in brain weight. The corrected values are
            referred to as residuals.
          
        
        
          Analysis
          All data were analyzed using regression, correlation,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> statistical tests (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">StrAnatData</ENAMEX>.xlsfor
          original data used to perform this analysis). A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni/Dunn</ENAMEX> correction was used for post hoc
          examination of significant main effects in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>.
          This post-hoc test is functionally identical to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLSD</ENAMEX>, but the alpha level is more conservative
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.005</NUMEX>).
