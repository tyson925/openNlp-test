        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has
        increased significantly over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last fifteen years</TIMEX>, and
        recent estimates suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 160,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and
        adolescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> of the new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> cases reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, and most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were
        infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> through heterosexual contact.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention interventions can reduce risky sexual
        behaviour of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , and numerous studies have
        documented the effectiveness of various
        cognitive-behavioural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> intervention models [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who participated in a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> condom use skills educational session in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX> waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> were less likely to return to the
        sexually transmitted <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (STD) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> with a new STD
        than those who did not participate in the educational
        session [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Many interventions have been successful in increasing
        condom usage by supplementing condom use education and/or
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> education with training in other areas,
        such as negotiation skills (how to suggest condom use with
        a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>), assertiveness skills (how to resist
        unwanted sexual advances) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognitive</ENAMEX> coping skills (such
        as sexual self-control) and by improving self-esteem [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9 12</NUMEX> ] . Policy- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decision-makers</ENAMEX> who plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        prevention programs need information about the
        cost-effectiveness of these programs in order to maximize
        the benefits of limited <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention resources [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 13</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Here, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group Support</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WINGS</ENAMEX>) project, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-session <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-based
        intervention that offered training in condom use skills
        (using condoms correctly) and in communication skills (such
        as talking to sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> about condom usage) for urban
        heterosexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at high risk of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STDs</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Intervention content, delivery, and efficacy
          The methods of the WINGS intervention trial have been
          described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 14 15</NUMEX> ] . A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at high risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">STD</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> were
          recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995 through July 1997</TIMEX>. After completing baseline
          interviews, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were randomly assigned to the
          intervention or to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The intervention
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> sessions included components on reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and
          STD risk identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ,
          specifically training in the proper use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and
          female condoms and building skills in communication to
          sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> to encourage condom use (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> attended a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-hour</TIMEX>
          session on nutrition.
          Condom usage by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the WINGS intervention
          increased substantially, and at least part of this
          increase was attributable to intervention's effect on
          condom use skills and communication skills [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 15</NUMEX> ] . A
          model-based evaluation of the efficacy of the WINGS
          intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] demonstrated that most of the
          intervention's effect on increasing condom usage was
          attributable to the condom use skills component of the
          intervention.
          This analysis focussed on the cost-effectiveness of
          the intervention. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of
          the complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-session intervention and the two
          sessions of the intervention that addressed condom use
          skills. For brevity, we refer to the complete,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-session WINGS intervention as the "complete
          intervention" and we refer to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sessions that
          addressed condom skills training as the "condom use
          skills component" of the intervention. The condom use
          skills component was part of (not an alternative to) the
          complete intervention. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness
          of the condom use skills component of the intervention,
          we estimated the increase in condom usage attributable to
          the condom use skills component.
          We examined cost-effectiveness from the societal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, in which relevant costs and benefits were
          included in the analysis without regard to who might
          actually pay the costs or receive the benefits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
          We calculated intervention costs for the period during
          which the intervention was delivered. Benefits of the
          intervention (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">averted HIV infections</ENAMEX>) were assumed to
          accrue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6 months</TIMEX> following the intervention. The
          societal cost per <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection included the future
          medical care costs and indirect costs such as lost
          productivity, discounted at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
          The cost-effectiveness analysis comprised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main
          steps: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) retrospective analysis of the intervention's
          cost, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) estimation of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infections
          averted by the intervention, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) calculation of the
          cost-effectiveness ratios, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) sensitivity analyses
          to examine how the cost-effectiveness ratios would change
          over a range of assumptions about cost and effectiveness.
          We present the methods to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
          of the complete intervention. Except where noted, the
          methods to evaluate the "condom use skills component"
          were identical.
        
        
          Estimating the intervention's cost
          Cost estimates (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> dollars) were based primarily
          on cost information provided by the WINGS principal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, who estimated the various resources
          required to deliver the intervention. We obtained
          additional information from budget proposals of the WINGS
          project and from cost estimates of an earlier
          intervention of similar duration and intensity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> attended sessions in small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, costs
          were calculated per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Our assessment of
          intervention costs included the cost of rent for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> meeting spaces (including overhead and
          miscellaneous costs), facilitator wages and training,
          senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> time for quality assurance, recruitment,
          client costs (incentive payments, child care and
          transportation compensation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX>), and materials
          (such as condoms, anatomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and information
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pamphlets</ENAMEX>).
          The child care compensation, travel compensation, and
          incentive payments were assumed to cover all costs
          (direct and indirect) borne by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, such as
          travel expenses and foregone time for work or leisure. In
          calculating recruitment costs, we assumed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the
          total recruitment costs could be attributed to the
          randomized control nature of the study and not to the
          intervention itself.
          In assessing the cost of the condom use skills
          component of the intervention, we divided each cost item
          included in the complete intervention (except recruitment
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>) by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, as the condom use skills
          component had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> the number of sessions as the
          complete intervention. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recruitment</ENAMEX> and materials costs in
          the condom use skills component were assumed to be the
          same as the complete intervention, since recruitment
          would still be necessary regardless of the duration of
          the intervention and since most of the materials cost in
          the complete intervention were attributable to the two
          sessions of the intervention focussing on condom use
          skills.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> cases averted
          The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infections averted (A) by the
          intervention was estimated according to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Equation 1</ENAMEX>:
          
          where the intervention is assumed to increase the
          percentage of sexual encounters protected by condoms from
          ρ 
          b to ρ 
          i , ε is condom effectiveness per act
          of intercourse, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> is the probability of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> in
          the absence of the intervention, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the intervention.
          This approximation is derived from a model-based
          evaluation of the benefits of increases in occasional
          condom usage, which suggested that under conditions that
          prevail in many at-risk heterosexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> the
          relationship between increased condom usage and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> risk
          reduction is essentially linear [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . For example, if
          condoms were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> effective in preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX>, then an increase in condom usage from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> would reduce the risk of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95%</NUMEX>.
          Smaller increases in condom usage would yield smaller
          reductions in risk.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parameter</ENAMEX> values for equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1</NUMEX> are summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Values for ρ 
          b and ρ 
          i were obtained from the structural
          equation model estimates in a previous study of the
          efficacy of the WINGS intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Based on
          these model estimates (see appendix), we applied the
          following base case values for condom usage following the
          intervention: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.2%</NUMEX> for the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.7%</NUMEX> for the
          complete intervention, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56.8%</NUMEX> for the condom use
          skills component.
          Based on data from several sources, we assumed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.019</NUMEX>
          as the base case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> probability of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> in
          the absence of the intervention. Recent studies of
          high-risk urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV incidence</ENAMEX> rates in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.018</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 7</NUMEX> new infections per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] , with the highest rates observed among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who reported exchanging sex for money or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with a recent history of acquiring other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STDs</ENAMEX> such
          as syphilis. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> initially recruited for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WINGS</ENAMEX> trial, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-fourth</NUMEX> reported trading sex for
          money or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one-third</NUMEX> reported having an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STD</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Condom effectiveness (ε</ENAMEX>), the reduction in the per-act
          probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission when a condom is used,
          was set to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . We assumed the increase in condom
          usage attributable to the intervention would last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> (range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 9</NUMEX>) as the increases in condom usage
          attributable to the intervention were found to diminish
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six-month</TIMEX> follow-up interviews [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> was calculated from the annual
          probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) and the assumed duration
          of the intervention in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">- P</ENAMEX>) D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/12</NUMEX>. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R</ENAMEX> represents the base case probability of
          acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> (in the absence of the intervention) during
          the D <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> following the intervention.
        
        
          Cost-effectiveness ratios
          Using standard methods of cost-effectiveness analysis,
          we calculated the average cost per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> case averted as
          the net cost of the intervention divided by the estimated
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infections averted, where net cost refers
          to the intervention's cost minus the societal costs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> averted by the intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Averted HIV</ENAMEX>
          costs were calculated by multiplying the estimated number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">averted HIV</ENAMEX> cases by the cost per case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
          Our baseline estimate of the societal cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$337,000</NUMEX> per case, which includes the lifetime medical
          care costs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$195,000</NUMEX>, with future costs discounted at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annually</ENAMEX>) and indirect costs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$142,000</NUMEX>) such as lost
          economic productivity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . This estimate of the
          indirect costs per case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> was based on a recent
          report that indirect costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> comprised
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 45% to 102%</NUMEX> of the direct treatment costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . We used the midpoint of this range and assumed
          that indirect costs would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> of the direct medical
          costs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$195,000</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$142,000</NUMEX>). This estimate of the
          indirect costs is quite conservative compared to other
          studies which suggest the indirect costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> exceed
          the direct medical care costs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
          We did not calculate the cost per quality-adjusted
          life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (QALY) gained when indirect costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> were
          included in the cost per case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, because these
          indirect costs might be "double counted" if included in
          the numerator (as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">averted HIV</ENAMEX> costs) and the denominator
          (as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QALY</ENAMEX> measure) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">completeness</ENAMEX>, we repeated the analysis excluding the
          indirect costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> from the numerator, focussing
          solely on the direct medical care costs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$195,000</NUMEX>). The
          cost per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">QALY</ENAMEX> saved was calculated as the net cost of the
          intervention (the intervention's cost minus the direct
          medical care costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV averted</ENAMEX>) divided by the number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QALYs</ENAMEX> saved. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QALYs</ENAMEX> saved was calculated
          by multiplying the estimated number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">averted HIV</ENAMEX> cases
          by published estimates of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QALYs</ENAMEX> saved per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> case averted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          To assess the cost-effectiveness of the complete
          intervention and the condom use skills component, we
          compared these interventions to the alternative of no
          intervention, which we assumed would have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0</NUMEX> in program
          cost and would not avert any new cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. For the
          complete intervention, we also calculated the incremental
          cost-effectiveness ratios, which compare the complete
          intervention to the condom use skills component. The
          incremental cost per case averted was calculated as
          difference in net cost (the net cost of the complete
          intervention minus that of the condom use skills
          component) divided by the difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> cases averted
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> cases averted by the complete intervention minus the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> cases averted by the condom use skills component) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] . The incremental cost per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">QALY</ENAMEX> saved was calculated
          in an analogous manner.
        
        
          Sensitivity analyses
          We conducted univariate and multivariate sensitivity
          analyses. In the univariate analysis, we examined how the
          estimated cost per case averted changed when we varied
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> parameter at a time, holding other parameters at
          their base case values. The parameters we varied were the
          cost of the intervention, the effectiveness of the
          intervention (as measured by condom usage after the
          intervention), condom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> probability of
          acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>, the duration of the effectiveness of the
          intervention, and the cost per case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
          In the multivariate analysis we varied all of the
          parameters listed above simultaneously. Specifically, we
          chose values for each parameter under the assumption that
          these values were uniformly distributed between their
          respective lower and upper bounds. We then estimated the
          cost per case averted using these random values. We
          repeated this procedure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> times (a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX>"
          simulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ) to obtain a distribution of the
          estimated cost-effectiveness ratios.
          Ranges (upper and lower bounds) of all of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (except condom use, condom effectiveness, and
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QALYs</ENAMEX> saved per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> case averted) were
          chosen as ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX>'s base case value to
          allow for a wide variance in the values we applied in our
          sensitivity analyses. The selection of ranges for condom
          usage among intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> is described in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appendix</ENAMEX>. An analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV seroconversion</ENAMEX> studies
          indicated that condom usage decrease the per-act risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90% to 95%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . We applied a
          slightly wider range (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85% to 98%</NUMEX>) of possible values for
          condom effectiveness. The range for the number of QALYs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saved per HIV</ENAMEX> case averted was obtained from a previously
          published study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Sensitivity analyses
          In the univariate sensitivity analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>), the
          cost per case averted for the complete intervention
          ranged from cost-saving (a negative cost per case
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">averted</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $750,000</NUMEX>. The cost per case averted
          for the condom use skills component ranged from
          cost-saving to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $250,000</NUMEX>. The results were most
          sensitive to changes in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> probability of
          acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>, the effectiveness of the intervention (as
          measured by condom use among intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>),
          the duration of the intervention's effect on condom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">usage</ENAMEX>, and the cost of the intervention. When indirect
          costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> were excluded, the cost per case averted
          ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$81,345</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $900,000</NUMEX> for the
          complete intervention and from cost-saving to almost
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400,000</NUMEX> for the condom use skills component.
          In the multivariate sensitivity analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>),
          the cost per case averted for the complete intervention
          ranged from cost-saving to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $1.5 million</NUMEX>, with a
          median value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$302,254</NUMEX>. The cost per case averted for
          the condom use skills component ranged from cost-saving
          to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $600,000</NUMEX> per case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV averted</ENAMEX>, with a
          median value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13,504</NUMEX>. When considering only the direct
          medical care costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, the median cost per case
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">averted</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$444,409</NUMEX> (range: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27,506 to $1.6 million</NUMEX>) for
          the complete intervention and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150,201</NUMEX> (range:
          cost-saving to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$783,820</NUMEX>) for the condom use skills
          component.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Improving the cost-effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention
          interventions
          The finding that the condom use skills component was
          more cost-effective than the complete intervention is
          consistent with previous studies demonstrating the
          effectiveness of brief <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">STD</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV counselling</ENAMEX> sessions for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> at high risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STDs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 36</ENAMEX> ] . These
          findings suggest the possibility that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> budget,
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> infections could be prevented by providing brief
          interventions to a larger number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at risk for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> rather than providing more intensive and lengthy
          interventions to a smaller number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at risk for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
          Our analysis also illustrated the importance of
          targeting the intervention to those at the highest risk
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. The cost-effectiveness ratios improved
          substantially when we assumed an annual probability of
          acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> per year (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>), a probability
          consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV incidence</ENAMEX> rates in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
          of high-risk urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] .
          Reductions in the cost of the intervention would
          improve the program's cost-effectiveness (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The
          WINGS intervention might be delivered in a more
          cost-effective manner in other settings. For example, if
          incorporated into existing programs such as drug
          treatment or into corrections settings, additional
          recruitment expenses, incentive payments, transportation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meals</ENAMEX>, and child care would not be required.
        
        
          Limitations
          Our analysis is subject to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> main
          limitations, the most important of which is the
          uncertainty in quantifying the effectiveness of the WINGS
          intervention. Intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> showed a
          significant increase in use of the female condom as
          compared to the control group [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Condom usage, as
          measured by the odds of condom use (male and female
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">condoms</ENAMEX>), increased substantially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the
          intervention and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the control group [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          Although this increase in condom usage for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the
          intervention was not statistically different from the
          (lesser) increase shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          the WINGS intervention did increase condom use skills and
          communication skills, and these improved skills were
          linked to increases in the probability of condom usage [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] (see appendix).
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> limitation is that the condom use skills
          component was not actually offered as separate, brief
          intervention, but was part of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-session
          intervention required of all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">WINGS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
          As a result, we based our analysis of the effectiveness
          of the condom use skills component and the complete
          intervention on estimates of the efficacy of individual
          components of the intervention suggested by a structural
          equation model of the complete intervention's efficacy
          (see appendix). If we incorrectly attributed some of the
          effect of the complete intervention to the condom use
          skills component, our estimates will understate the
          incremental cost-effectiveness of the complete
          intervention and overstate the average cost-effectiveness
          of the condom use skills component. Further, because the
          effects of the condom use skills component may be
          different when provided alone than when provided in the
          context of a longer, multifaceted intervention, the
          estimated cost-effectiveness of the condom use skills
          component may be biased.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> limitation is the uncertainty in estimating
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infections averted by the increase in
          condom use. Our simple approximation was based on an
          application [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
          transmission which found that the relationship between
          increased condom usage and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> risk reduction is
          essentially linear for most heterosexuals at risk for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
          In our simplified model we applied the estimated
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> probability of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> among high-risk urban
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. This average annual probability reflects an
          average of the various epidemiological and behavioural
          factors which affect the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> probability of acquiring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>, such as per-act <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission probabilities,
          number of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV prevalence</ENAMEX> rates in the
          sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> probability of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> was
          the only key input required for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to provide an
          estimate of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> cases averted through an
          increase in condom usage. Precise values for annual
          probability of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> were difficult to obtain.
          Our base case probability of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WINGSparticipants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.019</NUMEX>) was higher than suggested by
          the incidence rates reported in some studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at
          high risk for acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.018</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> new infections
          per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] ), but substantially lower
          than others (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX> or more new infections per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person-years</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] ).
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> limitation is that we collected cost
          information retrospectively from the WINGS intervention
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal investigators</ENAMEX>. The cost estimates they
          provided, however, were reasonably consistent with the
          detailed budget proposals they submitted prior to the
          delivery of the intervention. Furthermore, the estimated
          cost of the WINGS intervention (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$456</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>) is
          consistent with that of other small-group <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention
          interventions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$450</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-session intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300</NUMEX> per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-session intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ).
        
        
          Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underestimation</ENAMEX> of
          cost-effectiveness
          Unlike the WINGS intervention, many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> interventions
          have been found to be cost-saving [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 34</ENAMEX> ] , which occurs
          when the costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV averted</ENAMEX> by the intervention
          outweighs the cost of implementing the intervention. We
          note that the condom skills component of the
          intervention, however, did appear to be cost-saving when
          indirect costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> were included in the analysis.
          Under many scenarios explored in the sensitivity analyses
          the WINGS intervention and the condom use skills
          component were cost-saving.
          Furthermore, additional limitations of our analysis
          may have caused a substantial underestimation of the
          cost-effectiveness of the WINGS intervention. First, our
          analysis focussed on the prevention of the acquisition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the intervention and ignored the
          possibility of preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection among the women's
          sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, in focussing only on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention
          we ignored other potential benefits of the intervention
          such as reductions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STDs</ENAMEX> and unintended
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pregnancies</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, although the intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> reported
          a substantial increase in condom usage, we only
          attributed a small part of this increase to the effects
          of the intervention. The increase in condom usage we did
          attribute to the intervention was the increase above and
          beyond the increase in condom usage reported by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and it is possible that part of the
          increase in condom usage by the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
          attributable to participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WINGS</ENAMEX> trial. For
          example, measures of condom use skills were obtained for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on several occasions,
          requiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to perform such tasks as opening the
          condom package, unrolling the condom, and placing the
          condom on an anatomical model. If participation in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tasks</ENAMEX> contributed to the increase in condom usage by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, then the actual effectiveness
          of the WINGS intervention would be understated in our
          analysis.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In sum, both the complete intervention and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-session condom use skills component appeared to be at
        least moderately cost-effective in preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> among
        at-risk urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, using published cost-effectiveness
        standards for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention interventions. Our analysis
        indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> interventions consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        sessions may be more cost-effective than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> sessions and
        suggested that, for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention budget, offering
        brief interventions for a large number of at-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may
        be more cost-effective in some cases than longer, more
        intensive and multifaceted interventions for a smaller
        number of at-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Appendix
        The efficacy of the WINGS intervention was based on a
        previously published evaluation which used a structural
        equation model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . To estimate ρ 
        b , the probability of condom use
        without the intervention, we used the probability of condom
        use for the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three month</TIMEX> followup, the
        (log) odds ratio of protected sex in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX>. Thus, log(ρ 
        b <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/ 1 - ρ</ENAMEX> 
        b ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>, or ρ 
        b / (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - ρ</ENAMEX> 
        b ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1388</NUMEX>, or ρ 
        b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5324</NUMEX>.
        To estimate ρ 
        i , the probability of condom use with
        the intervention, we estimated the increase in condom usage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the intervention. The structural equation
        model estimates suggested that the intervention increased
        the log (odds) of condom use by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1818</NUMEX>.
        This value was estimated as the appropriate product of
        the unstandardized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path coefficients</ENAMEX> connecting the
        intervention variable to the odds ratio of condom use
        outcome. A simplified version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> months
        after the intervention is provided in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        Through recursive substitutions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , it can be shown
        that the regression coefficient linking the Treatment or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Group</ENAMEX> Status variable and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Odds of Condom Usage</ENAMEX>
        is: (A*B)+(C*<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E*F</ENAMEX>)+(A*D*F), where A,B,C,D,E, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> are all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> to be estimated. Applying the published
        estimates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3in Greenberg et al. 2000</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ) of
        these coefficients yielded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated 0.1818</NUMEX> increase in
        the (log) odds of condom usage attributable to the
        intervention. Thus, for the complete intervention, log (ρ 
        i / <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - ρ</ENAMEX> 
        i ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1818</NUMEX>, or ρ 
        i / (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - ρ</ENAMEX>

        i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5773</NUMEX>.
        Similarly, we calculated the effect of increased condom
        use skills by calculating (A*B) + (A*D*F), which yielded an
        estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1436</NUMEX> increase in the log (odds) of condom usage
        attributable to the condom use skills component. Thus, for
        the condom use skills component, log (ρ 
        i / <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - ρ</ENAMEX> 
        i ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1436</NUMEX>, or ρ 
        i / (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - ρ</ENAMEX> 
        i ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3147</NUMEX>, or ρ 
        i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5680</NUMEX>.
        In sum, the estimated probability of condom usage for a
        given act of sexual intercourse is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.2%</NUMEX> without the
        intervention, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.7%</NUMEX> for the complete intervention and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56.8%</NUMEX>
        for the condom use skills component. Using these baseline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probabilities</ENAMEX>, condom usage is increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> percentage
        points (in absolute terms) among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the complete
        intervention, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> percentage points could be
        attributed to the condom use skills component. To generate
        ranges (to be used in the sensitivity analysis) for the
        estimated condom usage among intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, we
        varied these increases by ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>.
