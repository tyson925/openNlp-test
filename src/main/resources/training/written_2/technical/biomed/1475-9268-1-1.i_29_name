        During meiosis homologous chromosomes replicate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> to
        form a "bivalent," experience a high rate of recombination,
        and undergo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of chromosome segregation to produce
        haploid meiotic products. In meiosis I (MI) homologous
        chromosomes segregate from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in a reductional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>, and during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">meiosis II</ENAMEX> (MII) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids
        segregate from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-another in an equational division
        similar to mitosis.
        Crossover recombination (reciprocal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>) generates
        chiasmata, physical connections between homologs, which
        provide the primary mechanism to ensure proper segregation
        of homologs during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In the absence of chiasmata
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">crossovers</NUMEX>), homologous chromosomes experience
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nondisjunction</ENAMEX> and segregate randomly from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>.
        However, backup <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">achiasmatic</ENAMEX> or "distributive" mechanisms
        have been identified in some species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        These distributive segregation systems can partially or
        almost fully restore faithful segregation of chromosomes
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> in the absence of recombination.
        The respective contributions of chiasmatic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">achiasmatic</ENAMEX> (distributive) modes of chromosome segregation
        can be studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> with naturally-occurring
        achiasmatic chromosomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , in cells harboring
        non-recombined artificial chromosomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , and in
        achiasmatic mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Among achiasmatic mutants,
        those lacking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Spo11</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Rec12</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are of particular
        interest because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spo11</ENAMEX> has a key role in the initiation of
        recombination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Meiotically induced, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spo11</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Rec12</NUMEX>)-dependent
        double-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (dsDNA) breaks have been demonstrated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">budding yeast</ENAMEX> and fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Spo11
        almost certainly catalyzes these breaks, as it shares high
        homology with the A subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topoisomerase VI</ENAMEX> of 
        Sulfolobus shibatae [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] and it
        becomes linked by a phosphotyrosine linkage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end
        of the cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Spo11 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> have
        been identified in a wide range of eukaryotes, and
        available evidence suggests that initiation of meiotic
        recombination via Spo11-dependent dsDNA break formation is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . Our results with the fission
        yeast 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe fully support this view (see
        results and discussion).
        Spo11 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has potential functions in addition to
        catalyzing dsDNA breaks. It is dispensable for chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairing</ENAMEX> and synapsis in some organisms, but is required in
        others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . Budding yeast 
        spo11Δ (null) mutants lack chromosome
        pairing, but catalytic site tyrosine mutants ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spo11-Y135F</ENAMEX> ) support significant
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DSB-independent pairing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , so the function
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Spo11 proteins</ENAMEX> in pairing may be separable from its
        function in catalyzing recombination. Localization of Spo11
        across synapsed, pachytene chromosomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also
        suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spo11</ENAMEX> has an additional role, after it
        catalyzes recombination, in meiosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        This study examined the relationship between meiotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> and chromosome segregation in 
        rec12 ( 
        spo11 ) mutants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fission yeast</ENAMEX>. We
        report that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> and its active site tyrosine are
        essential for crossover recombination in multiple intervals
        of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> chromosomes. Rec12 also has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> roles in
        reductional chromosome segregation during MI: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>,
        catalytically-active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12</ENAMEX> is required for normal levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductional</ENAMEX> (chiasmatic) segregation. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        catalytically-inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> facilitates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">achiasmatic</ENAMEX> (distributive) segregation. In addition, we
        report that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rec12</ENAMEX> and its active site tyrosine are required
        for proper equational chromosome segregation during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Structure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">rec12</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and complementation by
          rec12 +cDNA
          While 
          rec12 +was reported to encode a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> amio <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , conceptual translation
          of the surrounding region suggested that 
          rec12 +encoded a larger protein
          with homology to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Spo11</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Top6A</NUMEX> of 
          Sulfolobus shibatae [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 21</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alignments</ENAMEX> and splicing sequence profiles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] were
          used to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> putative introns (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>).
          Oligonucleotide primer pairs flanking each of the
          putative introns were used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> to amplify
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and meiotic mRNA, respectively. In each case,
          the product from mRNA was shorter than that from genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, confirming the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four introns</NUMEX> (Figure
          1A).
          Presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> introns suggested that the 
          rec12 +cDNA encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">345</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with high homology to eukaryotic Spo11
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). To test this hypothesis, we
          introduced a full-length genomic clone and a
          sequence-confirmed cDNA into inducible expression vectors
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] in such a way that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> methionine in
          predicted exon 1 would be used for translation (Figure
          1C). Each of these constructs restored wild-type levels
          of recombination to 
          rec12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> strains (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>).
          We conclude that the cDNA encodes a functional Rec12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">345</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length. This conclusion was
          confirmed by Western blotting of an epitope-tagged Rec12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> expressed from the endogenous 
          rec12 +locus: a meiotically-induced
          protein band of the expected size was observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.D.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.P. Wahls</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations).
          Rec12 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Spo11</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> shares homology with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catalytic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Top6A</NUMEX>) subunit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topoisomerase VI</ENAMEX>, which
          functions as a heterotetramer with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Top6B</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
          However, no <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Top6B</NUMEX> homolog is present in most eukaryotes
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Rec12</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Spo11</NUMEX>) enzyme does not need to affect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> passage in the manner of canonical type II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topoisomerases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . We therefore tested whether
          overexpression of 
          rec12 +would lead to a
          hyper-recombination phenotype, thereby implicating
          function as a homodimer. Very low levels of ectopic 
          rec12 +expression restored
          wild-type recombination levels to the 
          rec12-117 mutant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>),
          confirming that functional Rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was produced.
          However, upon overexpression of 
          rec12 +the frequency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinants</ENAMEX> did not increase significantly above
          wild-type levels (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> in
          excess of wild-type levels is biologically inactive; some
          other factor becomes rate-limiting under these
          circumstances.
          The 
          rec12-117 mutant was isolated in a
          genetic screen; the 
          rec12-117 mutation reportedly
          confers a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater</NUMEX> reduction of intragenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold reduction of intergenic
          recombination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . To define more precisely the
          requirement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rec12</TIMEX> in meiotic chromosome dynamics, we
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> replacement to generate a null ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> ) mutation and a mutation
          in the putative active site tyrosine ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> ). We then determined
          the effects of these mutations upon intergenic
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">crossover</NUMEX>) recombination within intervals of chromosomes
          
          I , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> . We also employed a
          combination of cytological and genetic approaches to
          reveal the nature of meiotic chromosome segregation
          defects for each chromosome in each of the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Rec12 and its active site tyrosine are required for
          chiasmatic meioses
          Models for recombination posit that gene conversion
          and reciprocal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> (crossover recombination) are
          alternative outcomes of a common intermediate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          Intragenic recombination at the 
          ade6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>, a measure of gene
          conversion, was reduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX>-fold in 
          rec12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , and we
          have obtained similar results with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rec12-117 ,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.D.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.P. Wahls</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). Because
          reciprocal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> accompanies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of all
          gene conversions at the 
          ade6 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] , the 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> must also have a
          reduced number of reciprocal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> in the vicinity of
          
          ade6 .
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> is required for all (or most) meiotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>, then 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> might fail to produce
          a sufficient number of reciprocal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> to ensure
          that each chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> receives at least one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crossover</ENAMEX>. To address this issue, we determined the
          number of crossovers present in regions of chromosomes 
          I , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (deletion) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> (active site) mutants.
          Multiple genetic intervals encompassing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX>
          of the genome (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">444 cM</NUMEX>) were analyzed.
          Intergenic recombination was reduced an average of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX>-fold in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) mutants and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263</NUMEX>-fold in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> (active site) mutants,
          relative to wild-type levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Thus, Rec12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and its active site tyrosine are likely required
          for most crossover recombination throughout the genome.
          Because there are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 11 and 18 crossovers</NUMEX> per
          chromosome in wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe meioses, and those
          crossovers are distributed without interference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ,
          we can estimate the residual number of crossovers present
          on each chromosome in the 
          rec12 mutant meioses. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>-fold
          reduction in recombination would leave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crossovers</ENAMEX> per chromosome, so <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> chromosomes in
          most of the 
          rec12 mutant meioses are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">achiasmatic</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Rec12 is required for proper meiotic chromosome
          segregation
          The 
          rec12 mutant meioses are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">achiasmatic</ENAMEX> and would thus be expected to suffer
          chromosome segregation errors during meiosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. To</ENAMEX> gain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into this possibility, asci from meiotic cultures
          were stained with a DNA specific fluorescent dye (DAPI)
          and visualized by differential interference contrast
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIC</ENAMEX>) and fluorescence microscopy. The majority of asci
          from wild-type cells contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four well</NUMEX>-rounded spores,
          each with a single DAPI-staining body of equal intensity
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were proficient at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meiosis</ENAMEX> and underwent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> as revealed
          by ascus development and the distribution of chromosomes.
          However, each of the 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> exhibited a high
          frequency of chromosome segregation errors that were
          sometimes accompanied by defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spore</ENAMEX> formation
          and/or ascus development (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). The data from a
          large number of asci from each mutant are presented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schematically</ENAMEX> in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>.
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">rec12-117 ,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> mutants exhibited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitatively</ENAMEX> and quantitatively similar cytological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>). They each produced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 60%</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX> of asci with gross defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> distribution.
          These mutant phenotypes were not uniform; different asci
          from the same cross were differentially affected (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This heterogeneous phenotype is characteristic of a
          variety of mutations that directly affect meiotic
          chromosome dynamics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberrant</ENAMEX> (or random)
          assortment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> chromosome pairs (or twelve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatids</ENAMEX>) leads to heterogeneous DNA distributions
          within different asci.
          The 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> also exhibited high
          frequencies of additional developmental defects such as
          abnormal spore placement, reduced spore numbers, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">abnormal spore</ENAMEX> formation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>). It has been
          suggested previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] that these phenotypes are
          characteristic of a defect in meiosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> because spore
          formation in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> is controlled by the
          spindle pole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spindle</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42</NUMEX> ] .
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe produces ordered tetrads.
          If chromosomes segregated aberrantly during the MI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, and then segregated appropriately
          during the equational division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX>, one would expect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> spores to receive identical complements of
          chromosomes. However, among 
          rec12 mutant asci with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> spores
          and an aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> distribution (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, classes b,
          c, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>, e), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 26%</NUMEX> or less exhibited a pattern
          characteristic of simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MI nondisjunction</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>,
          classes c, e). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">The remaining 74%</NUMEX> or more had DNA
          distributions characteristic of precocious sister
          chromatid separation and/or MII segregation errors - DNA
          was unequally distributed between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> spores
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, classes b, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>). In some cases a defect in
          chromosome segregation during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> was visualized more
          directly. For example, in many cases DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> failed to
          separate properly into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> spores during the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>; Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, classes f,
          g, j, k, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> is required for some
          function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX>, as well as for recombination during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          rec12mutants produce a high frequency aneuploid
          meiotic products
          Since 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX>
          chromosome pairs, aberrant assortment during <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both
          of the meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> can produce, by chance, a
          significant fraction of meiotic products that receive at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of each chromosome and are hence viable [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 43</NUMEX> ] . Aberrant segregation can also produce
          nullisomic aneuploids (missing one or more chromosomes),
          polysomic aneuploids (having additional copies of
          individual chromosomes), and diploids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39 44</NUMEX> ] . In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe the haploids and diploids
          are viable, nullisomic aneuploids are inviable, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disomic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aneuploids</ENAMEX> tend to lose the extra chromosome or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> and become haploid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . We therefore
          determined the frequencies of spore viability and meiotic
          diploidy as genetic measures of chromosome segregation
          errors.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 50%</NUMEX> of the meiotic products from the 
          rec12-117 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) mutants were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inviable</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>), indicating that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX> of the
          products were nullisomic for one or more chromosomes.
          This value is close to the frequency (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>) of nullisomics
          that one would expect if chromosome segregation were
          completely random in either one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic
          divisions. Interestingly, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> mutant produced a
          significantly higher frequency of inviable spores than
          the 
          rec12-117 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>),
          suggesting that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> is a separation of
          function mutation.
          As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> measure of aberrant segregation, we
          determined the frequency of diploid spore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX>. Each of the 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutants</ENAMEX> behaved similarly and
          produced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> diploid meiotic products, more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-fold</NUMEX> higher than the frequency produced by
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). If chromosome segregation
          were completely random in either one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">divisions</ENAMEX>, one would expect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 4%</NUMEX> of the
          viable products to be disomic for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> chromosomes.
          The value obtained in the 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold higher
          than the predicted random value, indicating that the
          segregation errors are not simply the consequence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> chromosome assortment (nondisjunction) occurring
          exclusively during one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Rec12 is required for chiasmatic and achiasmatic
          chromosome segregation during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>; and its active site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine</ENAMEX> is required for chromosome segregation during
          MII
          Because each of the 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> had aberrant meiotic
          chromosome segregation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), produced a high
          frequency of viable meiotic products (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>), and
          produced a high frequency of meiotic diploids (Figure
          4B), we were able to monitor directly the segregation
          patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> chromosome pairs in each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX>. Meiotic diploids were genotyped for
          heteroallelic, centromere-linked markers on each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> chromosomes. Those data were compared to the
          inheritance patterns predicted for each type of
          chromosome missegregation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the diploid products from the 
          rec12-117 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) meioses were
          heterozygous for centromere-linked markers on chromosomes
          
          I , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5E</NUMEX>). Thus, those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meioses</ENAMEX> did not exhibit simple MI nondisjunction, because
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diploids</ENAMEX> arising from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction would be
          heterozygous at the centromeres (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Precocious</ENAMEX>
          separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 46</NUMEX> ] can
          also produce diploid meiotic products, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> of which would
          be heterozygous for centromere markers (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5D</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ]
          . However, the average heterozygosities in the 
          rec12-117 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were
          significantly below this value, indicating that these
          mutants must have suffered some proportion of MII
          segregation errors. By applying mapping functions for
          aneuploid meiotic products [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , we can set a lower
          limit of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22% and 29%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> nondisjunction for the 
          rec12-117 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meioses</ENAMEX> analyzed,
          respectively.
          Surprisingly, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> (active site) mutants
          produced meiotic diploids that were almost exclusively
          homozygous for centromere-linked markers (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5E</NUMEX>). The
          average heterozygosity for loci on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> chromosomes
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 ± 4.1%</NUMEX>. This indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95%</NUMEX> of those 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> mutant cells that
          produced diploid spores must have successfully completed
          the reductional segregation of chromosomes (MI) and
          failed to properly segregate sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chromatids</ENAMEX> during the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equational</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> (MII).
          While there was clear cytological evidence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meiotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and aberrant chromosome assortment in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> in the majority of 
          rec12 mutant cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), it
          remained possible that some of the diploid meiotic
          products were derived from cells that had skipped one of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>, thereby biasing the chromosome
          segregation data. If this were the case, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          chromosomes within any given, individual meiotic product
          would exhibit identical segregation patterns. However,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the diploids from 
          rec12-117 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">meioses</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> of
          diploids from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">meioses</ENAMEX>, exhibited mixed
          patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> or MII missegregation for different
          chromosomes within individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Furthermore, the observed frequencies of mixed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">segregation</ENAMEX> matched the frequencies predicted from the
          average values for single chromosomes ( 
          e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> 
          vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> ). These data provide
          additional evidence that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> had
          occurred and that the diploids arose as a consequence of
          meiotic chromosome segregation defects.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rec12</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Spo11</NUMEX>)
          to initiate recombination
          Identification of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four introns</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and complete
          complementation of the 
          rec12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> hyporecombination defect
          by the full-length cDNA (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) confirmed that Rec12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is homologous to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Spo11</NUMEX> of other eukaryotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12</ENAMEX> and its active site tyrosine are required
          for intragenic and intergenic recombination at multiple
          locations on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> chromosomes (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, Tables 1,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, data not shown). We observed an average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX>-fold and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263</NUMEX>-fold reduction in crossover recombination in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> mutants for intervals
          encompassing ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the genome. Since wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44 crossovers</NUMEX> per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meiosis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 11 and 18</NUMEX> per chromosome) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , the
          mutants statistically have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 0.1 crossovers</NUMEX> per
          chromosome per meiosis and are thus achiasmatic.
          It was reported previously that 
          rec12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> mutants exhibit only a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold reduction in crossover recombination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ,
          which is at odds with our value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a 250</NUMEX>-fold
          reduction in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> (active site) mutants
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This discrepancy is not due to the nature of
          the 
          rec12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> allele, as we have also
          observed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>-fold or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater</NUMEX> reduction in crossovers in
          
          rec12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> mutants (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.D. Sharif</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.P. Wahls</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). Our observation that 
          rec12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX> mutants produce a high
          frequency of viable diploid meiotic products, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX>
          of which are heterozygous for centromere linked markers
          (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), provides a straightforward
          reason for the discrepancy: The previous study failed to
          exclude diploid spore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and scored only for double
          prototrophic recombinants (the double auxotrophic,
          reciprocal recombinants were not analyzed). Presumably
          the bulk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> reported previously as
          "recombinants" were actually diploids (or disomics)
          exhibiting intergenic complementation.
          We used dosage studies to see if Rec12 functions in a
          manner predicted by homology to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Spo11/Top6A.</ENAMEX> Upon
          overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX>, the frequency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> did not increase beyond wild-type levels
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The simplest interpretation is that Rec12
          functions in a multisubunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>; a complex in
          which other components are required either for efficient
          catalysis of dsDNA breaks or for correct subcellular
          localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rec12</TIMEX>. In budding yeast the active site
          mutation exhibits allele-specific semidominance when
          heterozygous with wild-type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , and we have made
          similar observations in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.D. Sharif</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.P. Wahls</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). This provides evidence
          that a dimer of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rec12/</ENAMEX>Spo11 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, harboring two
          functional active sites, is required for catalysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsDNA</ENAMEX> breaks in each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. Thus, with regard to
          primary protein sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), inferred subunit
          structure (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and</ENAMEX> data not shown), strict
          requirement for meiotic recombination (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and dependence upon its active site tyrosine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> is a structurally and functionally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spo11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of enzymes that
          catalyze meiotic dsDNA cleavage to initiate recombination
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Rec12 has dual roles in chiasmatic and achiasmatic
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">distributive</NUMEX>) chromosome segregation during Meiosis
          I
          In the absence of crossover recombination (chiasmata)
          and a backup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distributive</ENAMEX> (achiasmatic) system for
          chromosome segregation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction should occur
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of any resulting diploid spore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> would be
          heterozygous for centromere linked markers (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>).
          However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 50%</NUMEX> of diploid meiotic products from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) mutant meioses
          were heterozygous for centromere linked markers (Figure
          5E), indicating that some fraction of the products were
          derived from precocious separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSS</ENAMEX>) and/or MII nondisjunction (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5C</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5D</TIMEX>). Since
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSS</ENAMEX> does not occur in 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">null mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] , those
          centromere-homozygous chromosomes must have experienced a
          proper reductional segregation and a failed equational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">segregation</ENAMEX> (discussed below).
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) mutants are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">achiasmatic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and, as anticipated, exhibit a high
          frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          However, the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction observed is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> of that expected, suggesting the presence of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distributive</ENAMEX> (achiasmatic) system of chromosome
          segregation. There is precedence for a distributive MI
          segregation system in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 53</ENAMEX> ] . In 
          rec7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyporecombination</ENAMEX> mutants of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity of</ENAMEX>
          segregation of homologs during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> exceeds the expected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> segregation of
          GFP-tagged centromeres in 
          rec12 deletion mutants occurs at
          non-random levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Davis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.R. Smith</ENAMEX>, personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>), in good agreement with our genetic
          results. In each case identified, this distributive
          system of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fission yeast</ENAMEX> can partially circumvent the MI
          segregation errors of achiasmatic chromosomes;
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-quarter to one-half</NUMEX> of those homologs
          expected to nondisjoin ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, move to the same pole) end up
          segregating distributively ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, move to opposite poles).
          While the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> frequently
          suffer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> (active site) mutants
          produce meiotic diploids with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nearly normal MI</TIMEX>
          segregation patterns (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This
          difference is unrelated to crossover frequency, because
          the active site and null mutants have identical
          deficiencies in crossover recombination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Thus,
          Rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more functions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> that are
          distinct from its functions to catalyze recombination and
          mediate chiasmatic segregation. We propose that the
          Rec12-Y98F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> facilitates distributive segregation
          of achiasmatic chromosomes during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>.
          A meiotic checkpoint could provide additional time for
          missegregating chromosomes to correct their erroneous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wanderings</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . We propose two likely
          mechanisms by which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> improves the MI
          segregation of achiasmatic chromosomes. First, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rec12</TIMEX> may
          be required for an "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction checkpoint" that
          delays meiotic cells in which proper MI disjunction has
          failed to occur. If Rec12 were required for such a
          checkpoint, the null mutants would be achiasmatic, would
          fail to delay for the time period required to establish
          distributive segregation, and would consequently undergo
          high rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction. In the presence of
          Rec12-Y98F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> the checkpoint would be active,
          thereby allowing the achiasmatic chromosomes sufficient
          time to reorient and undergo distributive segregation.
          Meiotic progression in 
          spo11 ( 
          rec12 ) null mutants of budding
          yeast is accelerated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , supporting our hypothesis
          that Rec12 may participate in an "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkpoint</ENAMEX>."
          As an alternative (but not mutually exclusive)
          mechanism, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> may participate directly in the
          machinery of distributive segregation. In female meioses
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , heterochromatic
          pairing of homologs can substitute for chiasmata to
          ensure bipolar spindle attachment of bivalents and
          subsequent distributive segregation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 8</NUMEX> ] . Rec12
          may serve a similar role in maintaining a paired (or
          pseudo-paired) state between achiasmatic chromosomes
          prior to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. In support of this
          possibility, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Spo11</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> colocalizes extensively along
          homologously synapsed chromosomes during pachytene and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissociates</ENAMEX> when the homologs segregate from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-another
          during anaphase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Rec12 has a role in equational chromosome
          segregation during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Meiosis II</ENAMEX> that is dependent upon its
          active site tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytological</ENAMEX> and genetic data each demonstrated that
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> (active site) mutants
          frequently suffer chromosome segregation errors during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rec12</TIMEX> in
          equational chromosome segregation may be conserved, as 
          spo11 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> of 
          Sordaria macrospora also exhibit
          frequent MII nondisjunction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Tesse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Storlazzi</ENAMEX>, S.
          Gargano, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Zickler</ENAMEX>, personal communication).
          Irregular partitioning of chromosomes during the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meiotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> has also been reported in fission yeast 
          rec7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , so MII
          missegregation may be a relatively common fate for
          chromosomes in hyporecombination mutants. As described
          previously in this paper and elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , the
          biology of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fission yeast</ENAMEX> facilitates the identification
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> segregation defects that are difficult to detect
          in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that terminate meiotic progression or
          produce inviable meiotic products as a consequence of
          defects in meiotic chromosome dynamics.
          Although they exhibit a striking difference in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apparent MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction frequencies, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-D15</ENAMEX> (null) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> (active site) mutants
          manifest at most a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold difference in the absolute
          frequency of meiotic diploids exhibiting MII
          missegregation patterns (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Catalytically-inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rec12-Y98F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> apparently
          cannot enhance the fidelity appropriate MII segregation,
          relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> missegregation levels in cells lacking
          Rec12 entirely. We therefore propose that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX>
          mediates a signal, strictly dependent upon its active
          site tyrosine, that is required for the equational
          division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX>.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main hypotheses as to the nature of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rec12 protein</ENAMEX> itself may participate in
          the signal transduction. In 
          pat1-114 
          ts meioses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rec12</TIMEX> appears to persist
          until about the time of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herrera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Forsburg</ENAMEX>, personal communication), so
          Rec12 is available at the right time. Alternatively, some
          aspect of the crossovers or chiasmata may transduce the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. This could involve structural components that
          persist on chromosomes at the positions where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> and chiasmata had previously occurred, or
          could involve a diffusible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> generated by
          recombination events.
          At present, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hypothetical mechanisms by which a
          Rec12-dependent signal affects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> are proposed: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>,
          Rec12-dependent (recombination-dependent) signals might
          trigger a block after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, thereby allowing cells to skip
          a frequently irregular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . However, the
          majority of the 
          rec12 mutant meioses show evidence
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and many of the
          meiotic diploids exhibit mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> missegregation
          patterns for centromere linked markers on the three
          different chromosomes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSS</ENAMEX>,
          which does not occur at significant levels in 
          rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] , such mixed
          segregation patterns can only be generated by a
          combination of errors in both reductional and equational
          segregation. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hypothetical mechanism takes into
          account the coordinate, two-step release of sister
          chromatid cohesion that is essential for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meiotic
          divisions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Rec12-dependent (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">recombination-dependent</ENAMEX>) signals may be required for the
          proper maintenance and/or dissolution of
          centromere-proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatid cohesion in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX>.
          These and other hypotheses regarding the unambiguous
          requirement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rec12</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX> remain to be tested.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spo11</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Rec12</NUMEX>) in the initiation of meiotic
        recombination via catalysis of dsDNA breaks is conserved
        and likely universal among eukaryotes. The 
        rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">null</ENAMEX> and active site mutants
        are achiasmatic and, as anticipated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rec12</NUMEX>-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crossovers</ENAMEX> (chiasmata) are required to ensure proper
        reductional chromosome segregation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. In the absence of
        Rec12 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and crossovers, a backup distributive
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">achiasmatic</NUMEX>) segregation system operates successfully on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to half</NUMEX> of the chromosomes that would otherwise undergo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> nondisjunction. Presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">catalytically inactive</ENAMEX> Rec12
        protein enhances the fidelity of this distributive
        segregation system. In addition, catalytically active Rec12
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rec12</NUMEX>-dependent recombination) is required for
        faithful chromosome segregation during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MII</ENAMEX>.
