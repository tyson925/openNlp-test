        Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disorder characterized
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-chamber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dilation</ENAMEX> of the heart. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> is often
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progressive</ENAMEX> and results in reduced heart function and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX>. Although etiologically diverse,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inheritance</ENAMEX> is a significant contributor to the development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX>. Supporting this, mutations in a number of different
        genes have recently been associated with familial forms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , and mutations in the gene encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/C
        appear to be a significant component. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lamins A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> produced by alternative splicing
        from the same gene. They are identical along their first
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">566</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and differ only in their carboxyl terminus.
        As specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the intermediate filament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/C is found at the inner nuclear
        membrane where it forms a scaffold that interacts with a
        network of membrane bound and nucleoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        addition to chromatin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Mutations in the gene
        encoding the nuclear membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> emerin produce
        autosomal recessive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy</ENAMEX>, a
        disorder that phenotypically overlaps the neuromuscular and
        cardiovascular features seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/C mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        . Consistent with this, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/C directly binds emerin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lamins A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> are broadly expressed in many
        different cell types and are primarily expressed in
        terminally differentiated cells. It is not known how
        mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LMNA</ENAMEX> lead to tissue-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> autosomal dominant form of cardiomyopathy was
        mapped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> to the centromeric region of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linkage</ENAMEX> was achieved using genetic and clinical
        material from a large, well-characterized kindred [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the striking characteristics from this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was
        the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> conduction system disease that
        primarily targeted the atrioventricular node [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the kindred exhibited sick <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sinus syndrome</ENAMEX>,
        atrial fibrillation and sudden death.
        In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> with conduction system disease and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">variable skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle involvement, mutations in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lamin A</ENAMEX>/C gene [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">OMIM 150330</ENAMEX>] have been shown to cause
        autosomal dominant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and autosomal recessive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy</ENAMEX> (EDMD), autosomal
        dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        ] , autosomal recessive type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Charcot-Marie Tooth type 2</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] , familial partial lipodystrophy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] ,
        Mandibuloacral dysplasia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hutchinson</ENAMEX>-Gilford
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progeria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The phenotypic spectrum from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> to EDMD
        and limb girdle muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy</ENAMEX> appears continuous.
        However, the mechanism by which 
        LMNA mutations lead to cardiac versus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is unknown.
        We now evaluated a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> and sinus bradycardia.
        Her immediate family history was significant for
        symptomatic bradycardia requiring pacemaker implantation.
        She is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the kindred initially described by
        Graber 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . We screened this
        individual for mutations and found a novel mutation in exon
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMNA</ENAMEX> . This two bp deletion is
        predicted to disrupt the reading frame and produce a
        truncated lamin A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Methods
        
          Patient recruitment
          Written and informed consent was obtained in
          accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX>. Clinical data were obtained through
          evaluations performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extraction from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was performed using PureGene
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s recommendations. PCR
          primers were designed to amplify all twelve protein
          coding exons of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> analysis of
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX> was carried out on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WAVE™</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transgenomic</ENAMEX>); exon
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> was analyzed at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">65.2°C</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%-56%-65%</NUMEX> acetonitrile.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDE™</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMC</ENAMEX>) as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          Direct sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products was completed using
          cycle sequencing. To confirm the presence of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were purified and digested with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AlwN I.</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phenotype Analysis</ENAMEX>
          A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 year-old</TIMEX> Caucasian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with a history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</ENAMEX>, sick <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sinus syndrome</ENAMEX>,
          dilated cardiomyopathy, and fatigue was seen in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic</ENAMEX>
          for evaluation and treatment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          a large kindred previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 9 10</NUMEX> ] . The
          patient was evaluated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EKG</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) that demonstrated
          marked sinus bradycardia and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> degree
          atrioventricular block. An echocardiogram showed moderate
          dilation of the left ventricle (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX> cm end diastolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal diameter</ENAMEX>) and mild dilation of the right
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ventricle</ENAMEX>. The left ventricular performance was estimated
          as the lower end of normal with a normal fractional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shortening</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> reported no
          neuromuscular complaints, and on physical exam showed no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">overt</ENAMEX> muscle weakness.
          The pedigree for this proband is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          All affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> had undergone pacemaker
          implantation for symptomatic bradycardia. Her mother
          reported fatigue and was also noted to have an abnormal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">biopsy</ENAMEX>. Because of her marked fatigue and
          family history of sudden death, a dual chamber pacemaker
          and automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defibrillator</ENAMEX> were implanted. Of note, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proband</ENAMEX> reported an improvement in her fatigue symptoms
          after pacer implantation. With pacemaker implantation,
          her baseline heart rate improved from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> bpm to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bpm</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genotype Analysis</ENAMEX>
          All twelve exons of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMNA</ENAMEX> were screened by denaturing
          high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon 5</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two bp</TIMEX> (CT) deletion was detected in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LMNA gene</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bp
          deletion falls into positions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">908 and 909</NUMEX> of the NCBI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Accession # NM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">170708</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX>. This frameshift mutation is expected to
          disrupt the lamin A and C sequences after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">302</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. In addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> novel amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPAQPAPEAAGSQGGEASRPGGLTGP</ENAMEX>) are added after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncation</ENAMEX>. The relatively high proline content of this
          additional sequence and the positioning of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncation</ENAMEX> would be expected to disrupt the second half
          of the coiled-coil region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. An additional
          98 unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with dilated cardiomyopathy were
          screened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSCP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHPLC</ENAMEX> and found not to carry the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">908</ENAMEX>_909delCT mutation. Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> chromosomes from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> were checked and found not to carry
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">908</ENAMEX>_909delCT mutation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our findings demonstrate a novel mutation in lamin A/C
        in a proband whose family was previously linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">conduction disease</ENAMEX> and chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1q21.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Mutations in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMNA</ENAMEX> gene associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> have a
        more severe prognosis and higher-event rates compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> that do not have 
        LMNA mutations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . A recent
        report describing another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with a 
        LMNA mutation causing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conduction</ENAMEX> system disease documents the need for permanent
        pacemaker implantation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Previous reports on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proband</ENAMEX>'s kindred support a high-event rate in family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> often resulting in sudden cardiac death even in
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with permanent pacemakers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . For
        example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with pacemakers for
        high-grade atrioventricular block died suddenly. Subjects
        with 
        LMNA mutations should be carefully
        evaluated for both pacemakers and defibrillators.
        It is presently unknown whether autosomal dominant lamin
        A/C mutations impart their phenotype through dominant
        negative or haploinsufficient mechanisms. The majority of
        reported 
        LMNA mutations are missense. In this
        case, the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is thought to be expressed and to
        act through a dominant interfering mechanism. A smaller
        number of 
        LMNA mutations are frameshifting and
        are expected to create truncated lamin A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. In</ENAMEX> at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, a nonsense mutation at amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid position 6</ENAMEX> was
        described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . This mutation is effectively a null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> and therefore, dominant mutations, at least in this
        case, would be expected to arise from haploinsufficiency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Of</ENAMEX> note, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with a null allele in 
        lmna display a phenotype only in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">homozygous</ENAMEX> state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The mutation we now describe is
        predicted to generate a substantial protein fragment
        consisting of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 37 KDa</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. The</ENAMEX> novel,
        proline-rich sequence that is predicted at the carboxyl
        terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">truncated lamin A</ENAMEX>/C may further interfere
        with lamin function. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lamins</ENAMEX> assemble into a higher order
        structure and truncations may interfere with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>.
        The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aberrantly</ENAMEX> assembled lamin filaments may
        also interfere with other lamin-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such
        as emerin or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nesprin-1α</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        The exact mechanism by which 
        LMNA mutations cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is not
        clearly elucidated at this time. However, it is clear that
        mutations in 
        LMNA cause tissue-specific disease
        affecting various differentiated cells including cardiac
        and skeletal muscle, adipocytes and neurons. This suggests
        that lamin's role at the nuclear membrane affects both
        cell-type and tissue-specific processes. Currently, there
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> theories regarding the effects of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LMNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> postulates
        that disruptions of the inner nuclear membrane affect
        heterochromatin scaffolding and thereby gene expression. In
        this model, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lamin A</ENAMEX>/C is necessary for the appropriate
        expression of tissue-specific genes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> theory, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mechanical stress hypothesis</ENAMEX>, suggests weakness in the
        nuclear lamina leaves certain tissues more prone to damage
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. This model was first raised when 
        LMNA mutations were primarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> affecting striated muscle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        . Interestingly, the preferential involvement of the
        specialized cells of the cardiac conduction system may
        support less the stress hypothesis as the cells of the
        atrioventricular node are less expected to undergo
        considerable deformation. The additional phenotypes now
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with 
        LMNA mutations also favor alternative
        mechanisms of pathogenicity.
        Conduction disease preceded the development of dilated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiomyopathy</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 10</ENAMEX> ] . This
        indicates the necessity for careful documentation of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> pedigree in the evaluation of patients
        with conduction system disease paying particular attention
        to sudden death, arrhythmia and bradycardia. Genotyping of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">conduction disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> may provide
        important information regarding device implantation.
        Genetic counseling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> should
        always accompany genetic testing as variable expressivity
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">penetrance</ENAMEX> may influence clinical
        decision making [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCM</ENAMEX> and conduction system disease
        should be screened by family history and genetic testing.
        Those found to have mutations in lamin A/C should be
        evaluated for placement of pacemakers and automatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defibrillators</ENAMEX> in order to prevent the sudden cardiac death
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this disease.
