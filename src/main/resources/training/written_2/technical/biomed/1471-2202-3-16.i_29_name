        Transection of the peripheral axons of primary sensory
        neurons results in profound alterations in their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, regenerative capacity, survival, excitability,
        transmitter function and sensitivity to diverse extrinsic
        and intrinsic signals [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . These changes are
        contributed to by transcriptional alterations triggered by
        a loss of trophic support from peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> organs,
        and by novel signals generated at the injury site. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> changes lead both to adaptive responses,
        such as the capacity to survive the injury and re-grow the
        injured axon, and maladaptive responses that can lead to a
        change in sensation, including the generation of
        neuropathic pain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Measurements of mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> made in many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> using diverse methodologies have identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> genes that are up-regulated and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        down-regulated after peripheral nerve injury [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        These regulated genes include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, ligand- and voltage-gated ion
        channels, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor tyrosine kinases</ENAMEX>, growth factors,
        cytokines, neuropeptides, cell cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, cell
        surface/extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix genes</ENAMEX>, and a miscellaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of enzymes.
        We have now used high-density <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat genome</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> to analyze changes in gene expression at an
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early time</TIMEX> point (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>) following a peripheral nerve
        injury in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Oligonucleotide microarrays provide
        the capacity to analyze parallel changes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and have been used successfully to examine
        expression profile changes in many neuronal and
        non-neuronal systems [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> neurons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Studying the effect of peripheral nerve injury on gene
        expression profiles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> offers several advantages.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> represents a dense collection of cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of one
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of neuron, the primary sensory neuron. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> has a uniform impact on the cells, and the existence
        of a large pool of genes with known regulation allows for
        quality controls for changes identified by the microarrays
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Although microarrray technology offers enormous
        potential advantages, there remain important concerns about
        representation, sensitivity, reproducibility, variability
        and the false positive and negative detection rates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX>
        ] . What, if any, is the threshold fold-difference between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> that reflects real regulation? Is
        fold-difference the most sensitive measure for detecting
        changes? Are genes with a low expression levels in all
        conditions detected? What is the concordance rate between
        genes identified as regulated by independent methods and
        genes identified by the microarray analysis? What criteria
        need to be used to jointly minimize the false negative and
        the false positive rates? How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> need to be
        analyzed?
        We now show that fold-difference alone results in a high
        degree of error whilst detecting regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from
        microarrays, replicate arrays with statistical analysis
        reduces false positives and negatives. The oligonucleotide
        microarray screen indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of genes are
        regulated by neuronal injury, and that this technique is a
        powerful primary screen for such changes.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> U34A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> arrays were used
          to screen for changes in gene expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> neurons
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> following a peripheral nerve transection
          (axotomy, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ax</ENAMEX>) by comparing expression levels with
          non-injured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRGs</ENAMEX> (naïve, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> biologically
          independent array hybridizations were performed (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naïve</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> axotomy). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> tissue (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L4 and L5</TIMEX> from the
          left or ipsilateral side to the injury) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> male
          Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were pooled for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample was labeled separately and hybridized to
          a separate array. Genes were defined as detected if they
          received a present or marginal call in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of
          the arrays within each comparison. Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8799</TIMEX> annotated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) represented on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> U34A array, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, naïve arrays) were
          detected in arrays hybridized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">naïve rat DRG cRNA</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, axotomy arrays) genes in the axotomy
          comparisons.
          To assess the degree of variability inherent in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, the mean probe set intensity values of the two
          independent sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">naïve samples</ENAMEX> were compared on
          a scatter plot (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sets
          from the two control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) lie on or very
          close to the identity line, with a linear regression of r
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9898</NUMEX> (for all detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          comparison, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1Ashows</TIMEX> that most of the
          variation between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> naïve groups exists at the
          lower end of the gene expression levels. This suggests
          that this variability is in part due to array
          sensitivity. In consequence, differences in low intensity
          genes may be unreliable.
          A plot of the mean intensity from triplicate naives
          against triplicate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 day</TIMEX> axotomy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ax</ENAMEX>) arrays
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>) show many data points lying both above and
          below the identity line, suggesting regulation. Since
          each individual sample was pooled from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> male
          Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of a similar age and from a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplier</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charles River</ENAMEX>), biological variation is likely
          to be minimal.
        
        
          Defining regulated genes
          Many of the detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ax</ENAMEX> array comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> show no difference,
          defined as fold-difference up or down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1.15</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ax</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>). Further,
          many show small fold-differences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.15</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ax</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>). In total, genes
          displaying a fold-difference below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold accounted for
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> arrays and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ax</ENAMEX>
          comparison.
          When statistical significance is not taken into
          account, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> display a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> fold
          and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">28</NUMEX> a greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold difference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6% and 0.6%</NUMEX> of present genes respectively). In
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 369 genes show a fold-difference of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178</NUMEX> greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8% and 3.8%</NUMEX> of
          present genes respectively). Although a greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold change cut off eliminates most false positives
          (estimated error rate, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>), this specificity is at the
          expense of many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">putatively</ENAMEX> regulated genes. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> fold range in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, there are still
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">369</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ax</ENAMEX>] vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>]; Figure
          1E).
          In order to distinguish systematic from random
          differences in the array intensity levels, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test was performed for both comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, which
          was possible since each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> consisted of three
          independent experiments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the fundamental problems
          in analyzing microarray data is the risk of false
          positive results due to multiple hypothesis testing. The
          most conservative approach to this problem, a
          Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold, would not
          result in any significantly regulated genes, as the
          adjusted threshold would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.06 × 10 -5</NUMEX>, while the
          lowest P value attained in our data set for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ax</ENAMEX>.
          comparison was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.51 × 10 -5</NUMEX>. This would also rule out
          identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> via step-down methods based on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction. Therefore, we attempted to
          assess the accumulation of false positives empirically,
          by testing multiple hypotheses in our system on a sample
          not expected to include any true positives, i.e. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vs. N.</ENAMEX> comparison. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with a unadjusted
          significance of P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> (blue), P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX> (green)
          or P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX> (red) are indicated on the scatter plots
          in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1Cand 1D</TIMEX>, while the distribution of
          significant differences at different fold-changes is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in the table in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1E</TIMEX>. Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4599</TIMEX>
          detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">naïve samples</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> show a
          significant difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). The vast majority of these genes, however, exhibit
          low fold changes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1.5</NUMEX>-fold, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>).
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">369</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that show a fold-difference of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178</NUMEX> that were above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs.
          Ax comparison, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>) respectively were
          not significant (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1E</TIMEX>, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). These data
          indicate that using a fold-difference of greater than 2
          from triplicate samples to select regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will
          include many false positives. However, combining fold
          difference with significant difference in a two
          dimensional matrix can reduce the false positive error
          rate drastically. The combination of a ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold and
          significant difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> comparison compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vs. Ax</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-fold</NUMEX> difference (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>). The estimated
          error of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> using these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> criteria is much less than
          that obtained using just above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) or
          significance alone (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) and prevents many genes
          regulated below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold being excluded from consideration
          of regulation.
          The inherent array error rate (determined by the
          significant difference rate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> analysis) is
          clustered at low fold changes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>). However, many
          more genes achieve statistical significance at these
          small fold changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ax</ENAMEX> comparison than in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.15</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> fold: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.2%</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ax</ENAMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9%</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>]; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>) indicating that some low fold
          differences may be real. The degree of significance (P
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>) helps distinguish erroneous
          changes at these low fold levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Comparison of array data with the literature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> (see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) lists those genes
          previously shown to be regulated in various sciatic nerve

          expression intensity, fold change and P value derived for
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the arrays. Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> reported in the

          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> are not detected by the arrays
          indicating that array sensitivity is an issue. Amongst
          these are particular functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, i.e. such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX>, which are expressed at low

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> matched the criteria
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>1.5</NUMEX>-fold, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) for defining regulated genes
          across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ax</ENAMEX> comparison, and all of these were
          concordant with the changes reported in the literature
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In addition <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          detected genes whose levels had previously been described
          as unchanged by axotomy also did not vary on the arrays.
          Mismatches between changes expected from the literature
          and the arrays may be due to a failure of small
          differences to achieve statistical significance when
          using a triplicate analysis. Furthermore, differences in
          the timing, the nature of the injury models used and
          detection methods employed between this and earlier
          studies make detailed analysis of these data unfeasible.
          In order to detect true false positive and negative rates
          a direct comparison needs to be made between the array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set and transcript levels measured in samples
          equivalent to those used for array hybridization.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty four</NUMEX> genes detected by the arrays as being
          present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> and displaying up-, down- or no
          regulation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> after sciatic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">axotomy</ENAMEX> were
          analyzed by replicate quantitative slot blot (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          and Northern blot analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          chosen in a non-random fashion to encompass the range of
          hybridization intensities seen on the arrays, with
          expression levels less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> to intensity levels
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>. Genes were also chosen which
          displayed a wide range of fold-changes and varying p
          values and possible functions were taken into account
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2illustrates</NUMEX> representative triplicate slot
          blots for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with altered expression, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> showing
          an increase after axotomy (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Aand 2B</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a
          decrease (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). Cyclophilin, a gene known not to
          alter following axotomy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , was used to correct for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loading</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>). Each blot was prepared from
          independent L4 and L5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> extracted from
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> than those used for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triplicate</ENAMEX> slot blots were produced for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The concordance rate between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> and slot blot fold changes for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX> overall but concordance depended on gene
          expression level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Genes expressed at low levels
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> tended to display fold changes that varied
          from that found by the slot blots. It is likely that this
          is a consequence of the unreliable average intensity
          estimation for low level genes due to limited array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). If genes with a mean intensity
          expression level of less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> are removed from the
          analysis (top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> rows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), and the array fold
          changes of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are plotted against the
          slot blot fold changes, a very strong correlation is
          evident (linear regression r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8567</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2E</NUMEX>). The
          concordance rate of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> (using
          ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> to predict regulation). This
          shows that within the bounds of array sensitivity,
          average fold changes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> found to differ
          significantly between triplicate control and experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> represent a reasonable estimate of the relative
          changes in gene expression.
          Northern blot analysis, although requiring more
          tissue, both confirms that the correct transcript size is
          recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and enables splice variants to be
          identified (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 2were
          analyzed in this way and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX> splice forms were

          Dorsal root ganglia as well as containing the cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of primary sensory neurons also contain satellite
          glial cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schwann</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and immune cells and it is
          important, therefore to determine which of these cell
          types express the regulated genes. Here we use isotopic- 
          in situ hybridization (ISH) to
          determine the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> transcripts
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). All genes selected are neuronal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPcylo</ENAMEX>,

          post axotomy by triplicate northern slot blot (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          These genes show diverse patterns of regulation. While
          lysozyme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PACAP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MET-1</ENAMEX> are all up-regulated, for MET1
          this is only transient. Identical results were found by

          regeneration, cell survival, or alterations in sensory
          processing after nerve injury (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, see additional

        Discussion
        Although many studies have used microarray technology
        for expression profiling, the criteria for determining
        putatively regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from such analyses remain poorly
        defined, the current standard being a ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold difference
        in replicate arrays. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> high-density rat
        oligonucleotide-array data from control (naïve,
        non-injured) and experimental (axotomy, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 day</TIMEX> post
        peripheral nerve injury) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRGs</ENAMEX>, and comparing the
        differences detected in control vs. control and control vs.
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arrays</ENAMEX>, we have explored the optimal criteria
        for minimizing the false positive error rate. A ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">criterion</ENAMEX> alone was found to generate a substantial
        proportion of potential false positives, while also
        excluding many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">putatively</ENAMEX> regulated genes. Based on
        significant difference for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>),
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> differed in the control vs. control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">556</NUMEX> in the control vs. experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, again a
        prohibitively high false positive rate (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>). However, a
        combination of fold and significant difference was found to
        maximize the difference between control vs. control and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> vs. experimental array comparisons. Using
        ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">putatively</ENAMEX> regulated
        genes were detected in the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 12</NUMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, an estimated error rate of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>. If fold differences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> are included, many
        more significantly different genes are recruited (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">219</ENAMEX> in
        the experimental vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> in the control comparison) reducing
        the potential false negative rate. At the same time, the
        estimated false positive error rate rises to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.5 %</NUMEX>, still
        lower than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold alone error. Producing a reduction in
        false positive without also producing false negative
        differences requires the use both of fold and significant
        difference. The established <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold criterion is much too
        conservative; when using replicate arrays with pooled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to reduce biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, it loses <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 50%</NUMEX> of putatively regulated genes
        and fails to eliminate false positives. The very high
        concordance rate found between genes predicted from the
        array analysis to be regulated and measurements of mRNA for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> by quantitative Northern slot blots and 
        in situ hybridization, validates
        utilization of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dimensional matrix</ENAMEX> of fold and
        significant difference.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem with oligonucleotide arrays is sensitivity.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of transcripts, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX>, including
        the opiate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, which are expressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        ] fall below the microarray detection threshold. Lack of
        sensitivity may result from technical issues such as poor
        probe performance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] or low copy number transcripts.
        Tissue heterogeneity and neuronal subpopulation-restricted
        gene expression may lower the concentration of a transcript
        in the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample to below detection threshold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiao et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] published a study using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
        cDNA arrays to analyze genes regulated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX> following sciatic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">axotomy</ENAMEX>. Of the genes
        listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> were found in both studies
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peripheral Benzodiazepine</ENAMEX> receptor, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5HT3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gadd45</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CLP36</TIMEX>,
        Lysozyme, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNAP25</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VGF</ENAMEX>). Of those genes whose expression
        was analyzed across time in this study (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Lysozyme and SNAP25</TIMEX>, were also detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiao et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        . Both genes show very similar expression patterns over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies.
        In a different cDNA array study, also recently
        published, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were identified to be regulated by at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after sciatic axotomy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Of
        these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> were also identified by our study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the
        non-concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were not represented by known probe
        sets on the array used here. Others changed, but did not
        reach statistical significance, and likely represented
        differences in regulation levels relative to the time
        points used (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> as opposed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gene
        verified in this study, the small proline-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> 1A
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), was characterized in detail by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonilla et al</ENAMEX>,
        who show that it colocalizes with filamentous actin in
        membrane ruffles and augments axonal outgrowth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Comparison of the global lists of regulated genes
        between this study and other reports are complicated by the
        differing criteria used to identify regulated genes in the
        different studies. However, it is encouraging to note that
        a reasonable number of genes have been cross identified in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate array studies looking at the effects of
        peripheral nerve injury on dorsal root ganglion gene
        expression, pointing to the reliability of array
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> across differing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>.
        Why is the number of genes regulated in sensory neurons
        after peripheral nerve injury so large? The injury
        constitutes an enormous stress to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and also
        deprives it from contact with its normal target-derived
        neurotrophic support. Both of these events represent
        perturbations from normal cellular functioning that require
        a variety of compensatory responses. A major issue is cell
        survival. Injured adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> neurons do not die after axonal
        injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] as a result of the upregulation of cell
        survival factors such as the small heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> HSP27
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . We now find several genes that could have a
        survival-promoting role, including the peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">benzodiazepine</ENAMEX> receptor, whose agonists are potent
        antiapoptotic compounds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GADD45A</TIMEX>, which maintains
        genomic stability and appears to be anti-apoptotic in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> after ischemic damage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , metallothionein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1L</TIMEX>,
        which is a free radical scavenger [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , GTP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cyclohydrolase 1</ENAMEX>, which is obligatory for the actions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGF</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IES-JE</ENAMEX> (MCP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) which
        attracts macrophages, which in turn have been reported to
        have a role in neuronal survival [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Neurons with axons in the peripheral nervous system can
        successfully regenerate when injured [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . This is in
        part due to an environment permissive for axonal growth but
        also due to the upregulation of regeneration-associated
        genes (RAGs) which increase intrinsic growth capacity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAGs</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAP-43</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAP-23</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and
        sprp1A [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . We now find several other potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> including; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α2</NUMEX> macroglobulin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CLP36</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VGF</ENAMEX> all
        of which have been described to promote neurite outgrowth
        or interact with the cytoskeleton in a way that may promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX> [additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>] for
        references). MMP3 also known as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> kD polypeptide, transin
        or stromelysin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, a secreted protease, may facilitate
        neurite growth by dissolving the extracellular matrix of
        the basal lamina at the growing tip of the axon (see Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> for references).
        Sensory neurons react to peripheral nerve injury by
        increasing their excitability, changing their constitutive
        synaptic transmitter profile and even their synaptic
        contacts in the spinal cord. Interestingly, an analysis of
        the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of the genes differentially
        expressed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) reveals the contribution that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in transcription make to these processes.
        Several of these changes are maladaptive in the sense that
        they contribute to the generation of the abnormal
        sensations that constitute neuropathic pain, by producing
        ectopic spontaneous activity into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, altering
        synaptic drive, increasing excitability and diminishing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitory</ENAMEX> action in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord,
        and by making novel synaptic contacts with inappropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4</NUMEX> ] . A number of the injury-regulated genes we
        describe here may contribute directly to this altered
        sensory processing; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CB1 receptor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VGF</ENAMEX>, the phospholemman
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, SNAP25 A, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endothelin-1</ENAMEX> and the ligand-gated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5-HT3 receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We have
        only validated a small fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">putatively</ENAMEX> regulated
        genes detected by the arrays. Our analysis indicates that
        at a conservative estimate over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240</ENAMEX>
        genes, ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) are regulated by the
        injury. These include genes of a number of distinct
        functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, some of which appear to change in a
        uniform way. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and neurotransmitter related
        genes tend to decrease their expression while those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the cytoskeleton increase. This raises the
        possibility that numbers of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may be
        regulated together by common changes in signal transduction
        and transcription induced by the injury, and contribute in
        this way to the coordinated changes that constitute the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">axotomy</ENAMEX> response.
        Discovering and validating regulated genes by array
        analysis is clearly only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in elucidating
        their functional role. An evaluation of the cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> and distribution of the gene product as well
        as loss and gain of function manipulations 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo are required. Functional
        studies cannot yet be performed at a high throughput level
        and this represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the major limiting factors in
        analyzing the large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes identified
        by microarray analysis. Elucidating the specific role of
        genes regulated in sensory neurons after peripheral nerve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> will provide insight though into many major
        biological issues including cell survival, growth,
        intercellular communication and the factors that contribute
        to sensory abnormalities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray</ENAMEX> technology provides a
        powerful tool for beginning this analysis in a high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">throughput</ENAMEX> mode by revealing the extent of change in
        neuronal gene expression. Such analysis requires replicate
        measures to minimize variability, calculation of fold and
        significant differences to detect regulated genes with
        minimal false positive and negative confounders and
        validation of individual genes.
      
      
        Conclusions
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: A comparison of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> naïve (control)
        triplicate data sets allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the inherent
        variation present in the oligonucleotide array data.
        Analysis revealed a relatively high false positive error
        rate in the naïve versus axotomy (experimental) comparisons
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) when using only a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold criterion for regulated gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX>.
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: When statistical significance (P
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) was combined with a fold difference of greater
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> as the criteria for detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">putatively</ENAMEX> regulated
        genes, not only was the estimated false positive error
        substantially reduced (to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>), but also many more genes
        were identified compared with the established <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX>, in the naïve versus axotomy comparison (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> as
        opposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>).
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>: All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> displaying a fold
        change of greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> and a P-value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.05</NUMEX>
        are listed.
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>: To validate these findings we
        performed quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triplicate</ENAMEX> slot blots for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
        enabling a direct comparison between the statistically
        analyzed array data and the mRNA measurements. These
        comparisons show strong concordance between putative and
        actual regulation as well as a direct relationship between
        array fold change and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> fold change.
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>: Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were further quantified
        across a time course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3, 7 and 14 days</TIMEX> post axotomy.
        These genes show diverse patterns of regulation in response
        to nerve injury and underlie the importance of including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> as a dimension in any expression profile study.
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>: Genes detected from the arrays, as
        being likely to be regulated, were assigned to functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. These data suggest the reorganization of cell
        structural components following peripheral nerve injury,
        activation of genes expressed by immune and inflammatory
        cells, and a down-regulation of genes involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotransmission</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Surgical procedures
          All procedures were performed in accordance with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Hospital</ENAMEX> animal care regulations.
          Adult male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sprague Dawley rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-300 g</ENAMEX>) were
          anesthetized with halothane. For the sciatic nerve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transection</ENAMEX> (axotomy), the left sciatic nerve was exposed
          at the mid thigh level, ligated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/0</NUMEX> silk and
          sectioned distally. The wound was sutured in two layers,
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were allowed to recover.
        
        
          Tissue and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> preparation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were terminally anesthetized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L4 and L5</TIMEX> DRGs rapidly
          removed, and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C</TIMEX>. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted
          from homogenized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> samples using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid phenol</ENAMEX> extraction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIzol</ENAMEX> reagent, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gibco</ENAMEX>-BRL). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA concentration</ENAMEX> was
          evaluated by A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> measurement and quality assessed
          by electrophoresis on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> agarose gel. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample
          used for hybridization of each array was extracted from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rat L4</ENAMEX> and L5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRGs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ganglia pooled from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, per
          sample).

          microarrays, representing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8799</TIMEX> known transcripts and
          expressed sequence tags (ESTs), were used (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CA http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affymetrix</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>). Oligonucleotides are
          arranged in pairs corresponding to different regions of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> mRNA with multiple probe pairs. Each probe
          pair consists of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> nucleotide perfect match (PM) to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> region coupled with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer with a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> (MM) at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> thnucleotide. Transcript
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> is estimated by analysis of signal intensity of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM/MM</ENAMEX> pairs. The arrays are hybridized with
          biotin-labeled cRNA, prepared as per standard Affymetrix
          protocol. Briefly, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 μg</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRGs</ENAMEX> was reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> using an oligo-dT primer coupled to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
          polymerase binding site. Double-stranded cDNA was made
          and biotinylated-cRNA synthesized using T7 polymerase.
          The cRNA was hybridized for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> to an array,
          followed by binding with a streptavidin-conjugated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluorescent marker</ENAMEX>, and then incubated with a polyclonal
          anti-streptavidin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> coupled to phycoerythrin as an
          amplification step. Following washing, the chips were
          scanned with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard GeneArray</ENAMEX> laser scanner
          and data analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneChip</ENAMEX> software. External
          standards were included to control for hybridization
          efficiency and sensitivity.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybridization</ENAMEX> levels for each species of mRNA detected
          on the arrays are expressed by intensity (signal) and as
          present (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>), marginal (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) or absent (A) calls, calculated
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> software (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 5.0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">α1</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">α2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>). To
          normalize the array data standard Affymetrix protocols
          were employed, each array was scaled to a target signal
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> across all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 5.0</NUMEX>).
          The arrays were grouped for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> comparisons: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triplicate</ENAMEX> sets of naïve data compared with one another,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> triplicate naïve set compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> triplicate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post-axotomy</ENAMEX> set. The individual naïve arrays included in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triplicate</ENAMEX> set were picked randomly. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set was
          determined undetected if it received an A call in all of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> involved in the comparison. Detected were
          Present or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Marginal by MAS5.0</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> array for
          each analysis. Mean signal and standard deviation were
          calculated for each detected probe set. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value for
          rejecting the null hypothesis that the mean signals were
          equal between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> triplicate sets was calculated
          using an unpaired, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed t-test for independent
          samples with unequal variance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satterthwaite</ENAMEX>'s method).
          Fold-differences between the mean signals (A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> triplicate sets were calculated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX>(A, B) /
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>(A, B) with down regulation relative to naïve
          expressed as negative.
