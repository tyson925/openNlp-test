        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Converging</NUMEX> points of evidence implicate infection by
        high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) types as a critical
        etiologic factor in cervical tumorigenesis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiological</ENAMEX> and experimental data, however, show that
        only a small fraction of HPV-infected cervical
        intraepithelial neoplastic (CIN) lesions progress to
        invasive cervical carcinoma (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . These findings
        suggest somatic genetic mutations play a critical role in
        the initiation and progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. Delineation of these
        genetic changes is crucial to understanding the molecular
        basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. A number of genetic changes have been
        identified so far in invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. However, the precise
        mechanism of each of these genetic alterations in the
        multi-step pathway of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical tumor</ENAMEX> development is largely
        unknown. The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> is preceded by distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphological</ENAMEX> changes from normal epithelium to carcinoma
        through low-grade and high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">squamous</ENAMEX> intraepithelial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> (SILs). The genetic basis of this progression is
        also poorly understood.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytogenetic</ENAMEX> and molecular genetic analyses have
        identified the short arm of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX>, as frequently
        affected by duplications and deletions in a high proportion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . These findings suggest the presence of
        positively regulated amplified oncogenes and negatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">regulated tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes (TSGs) on this chromosomal
        arm. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), a molecular
        cytogenetic method that identifies chromosomal gains and
        losses, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies have also
        demonstrated recurrent deletions on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5p</TIMEX> in precancerous
        lesions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Although, these studies have
        identified 5p as a commonly affected region, the precise
        site of deletion that harbor putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSG</ENAMEX> is unknown
        because of the lack of systematic and detailed deletion
        mapping studies.
        To further characterize the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5p</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, we
        performed a high-resolution deletion mapping in invasive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>. We
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of minimal deletions at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5p15.3</NUMEX> and
        5p15<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX> spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.5 cM</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cM genetic distance,
        respectively. We have also shown that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5p15</NUMEX> region
        deletions occur in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CIN lesions</ENAMEX>. Here, we
        have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">candidate tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and confirmed the previous reports that the 5p
        deletions occur in a small proportion of precancerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.

          Identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of minimal deletions
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5p15.2</NUMEX>-p15.3
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCs</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> STRP
          markers mapped to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX> showed deletions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 of 60</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>)
          tumors in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> tumors
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.2%</NUMEX>) had LOH at all the informative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">markers</ENAMEX> suggesting genetic monosomy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
          patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> tumors that exhibited
          regional losses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX> were used to map the common deleted
          regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This has identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> minimal
          deletions at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5p15.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5p15.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1& Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          All the tumors that defined the minimal deletions showed
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60%</NUMEX> reduction in signal intensity in the
          deleted alleles.
          The distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5p15.3</ENAMEX> deletion spans the telomeric region
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encompassing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D5S392</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D5S678</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D5S417</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>
          tumors. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tumors (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-13</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-49</ENAMEX>) showed
          deletions of terminal marker <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D5S392</TIMEX> alone at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> cM genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>, which is the distal most marker on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX>, we
          considered the deletion boundaries defined by the
          proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker D5S417</ENAMEX> in tumors <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-105</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1& Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and proximal region of
          deletion spans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> markers (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D5S406, GATA82H02, D5S1455,</ENAMEX>
          D5S2054, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D5S635 and D5S676</TIMEX>), and was deleted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>
          tumors. The deletion boundaries were defined proximally
          by the tumors <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-59</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-66</ENAMEX>, while the distal boundary
          was identified by the tumors <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-59</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-114</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>&
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). All tumors that showed 5p deletions fell within
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> defined regions of deletions, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> tumors
          exhibited deletions at both regions. Thus, this analysis
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> discrete and closely mapped sites of
          minimal deletions at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5p15.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5p15.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX>, which were
          restricted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> cM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cM genetic distance,
          respectively.
        
        
          Gene expression analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> tumor
          suppressor genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines
          In an effort to identify the genes inactivated in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recurrent 5p</ENAMEX> deletions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, we identified candidate
          genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor function. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          identified at the terminal 5p15.3 deletion. These
          include, 
          PDCD6 , a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that plays a role
          in T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor-</ENAMEX>, FAS-, and glucocorticoid-induced
          cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TERT</ENAMEX> , a gene that encodes a
          reverse transcriptase component of telomerase,
          dysfunction of which promotes chromosomal instability [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] ; and 
          TRIP13 , a thyroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> receptor
          interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that binds with the human
          papillomavirus type <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HPV16</NUMEX>) E1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . We
          have identified 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POLS gene</ENAMEX> that encodes a DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase sigma</ENAMEX>, and plays a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatid cohesion at the proximal minimal deleted
          region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . We performed a semi-quantitative RT-PCR
          analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          PDCD6 , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TERT</ENAMEX> , 
          TRIP13 , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POLS</ENAMEX> ) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines and
          did not find evidence for lack of or down regulated
          expression compared to normal cervix (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          5p deletions in relation to HPV
          5p deletions did not show any significant differences
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at diagnosis and stage of the tumor (data not
          shown). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifty-eight</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.7%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> tumors studied were
          positive for HPV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tumors were
          HPV-negative. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> alone or in combination with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> was found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> tumors, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> tumors had
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>. 5p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> was found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> positive tumors, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>) tumors with other HPV-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> had 5p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          tumors that did not harbor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HPV</ENAMEX> infection also had LOH at
          5p. These differences were found to be statistically not
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi</ENAMEX> square <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.93</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>). However, when
          the analysis was restricted to HPV16 harboring tumors, it
          was found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> harboring HPV16 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> alone had
          5p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 of 36</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55.6%</NUMEX>) tumors, while the patients
          infected with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HPV16</NUMEX> in combination with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exhibited 9</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>. This difference was found to
          be statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.75</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>).
        
        
          5p deletions occur at low frequency in precancerous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lesions</ENAMEX>
          To understand the role of 5p deletions in cervical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer progression</ENAMEX>, we evaluated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> microdissected
          CIN specimens (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CINs</ENAMEX> and one low-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIN</ENAMEX>)
          using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRP</ENAMEX> markers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          informative tumors had LOH at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more markers. One
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">low-grade CIN</ENAMEX> did not show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>. Thus, deletions at 5p
          identified in high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CINs</ENAMEX> suggest that these genetic
          alterations occur prior to development of invasive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Extensive genetic studies have documented frequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alterations</ENAMEX> affecting various chromosomal regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGH</ENAMEX> analyses have consistently shown frequent loss
        of genomic material in a number of chromosomal regions
        suggesting the presence of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes
        at these sites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 15 16</NUMEX> ] . Of these, chromosome 5p
        deletions have been noted to be very frequent in invasive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . However, the locations of exact regions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> are not known because of a lack of systematic and
        high-resolution deletion mapping of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5p</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. We
        have previously identified that markers mapped to 5p15
        regions are more frequently deleted [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7</NUMEX> ] . To further
        characterize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5p</TIMEX> deletions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, we performed a
        high-density LOH mapping in the present study. We found
        high frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> and identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> minimal regions of
        deletions at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5p15.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5p15.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5p15.3</ENAMEX> minimal deletion spans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> cM
        genetic distance. Consistent with this pattern, the markers
        D5S392 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D5S417</ENAMEX> exhibited the highest frequency (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.8%</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.6%</NUMEX>, respectively) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> among all the tested loci.
        The genomic size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5p15.3</ENAMEX> deletion interval is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>. A database search has identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes, 
        PDCD6 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TERT</ENAMEX> , and 
        TRIP13 , with suggestive tumor
        suppressor gene function. The programmed cell death gene, 
        PDCD6 , is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ca2</NUMEX> +-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and a part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">apoptotic</ENAMEX> machinery controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>),
        Fas, and glucocorticoid signals [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 17</NUMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TERT</ENAMEX> encodes a reverse transcriptase
        required for the replication of chromosome termini and
        plays a role in telomere elongation. Although telomerase
        expression is a hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> component of telomerase (mTERC) exhibit progressive
        telomere shortening and chromosomal instability associated
        with epithelial tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with the
        established role of this enzyme in cell immortalization and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer pathogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , we did not find expression in
        normal cervix while it was abundantly present in all eight
        cell lines studied (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Recently, it has been shown
        that the hTERT amplification and over expression is common
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . 
        TRIP13 , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thyroid receptor</ENAMEX> interacting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein 13</ENAMEX>, is a transcription factor that regulates
        expression of a variety of specific target genes including
        the human papillomavirus type <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HPV16</NUMEX>) E1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        . Similar to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TERT</ENAMEX> , the 
        TRIP13 also showed very low
        expression in normal cervix and highly elevated levels of
        expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Presence of these
        genes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5p15.3</ENAMEX> interval suggests that they may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">target TSGs</ENAMEX> of these deletions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. However, expression
        analysis of these genes did not provide evidence of
        down-regulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> site of minimal deletion at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5p15.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX>
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.7</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.7</NUMEX> cM genetic distance spans
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> genomic region. A database search has
        identified 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POLS</ENAMEX> , a topoisomerase-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">function protein-4-1</ENAMEX>, gene that encodes polymerase (DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX>) sigma within the deleted region. The yeast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TRF4</ENAMEX> plays a critical role in chromosome
        segregation by coordinating between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatid cohesion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Analysis of expression
        of this gene in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines did not show evidence of down
        regulation. Although the genes tested so far showed no
        deregulated expression, it remains to be seen whether any
        of these genes or the others mapped to the minimal deleted
        regions are targets of mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. However, the
        present study identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">discrete sites</ENAMEX> of deletions at
        5p15.3 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5p15.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX> that harbor putative TSGs important
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> development providing a basis for their
        identification.
        5p deletions also have been reported in precursor CIN
        lesions with the frequencies <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 14.7 and 42%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . We have previously shown, in a different
        geographical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CINs</ENAMEX> had 5p deletions.
        Based on the follow-up studies, we suggested that 5p
        genetic deletions might identify high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> to invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In a more recent
        study it was also shown that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5p</NUMEX> deletions were
        significantly more frequent in dysplasias that were
        recurrent compared to non-recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dysplasias</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        These data therefore suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5p</NUMEX> genetic alterations
        occur early in cervical carcinogenesis and they may be
        critical to the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive cancer</ENAMEX>. Supporting
        previous reports, in the present study, we detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LOH</ENAMEX> at
        5p15 in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of the high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CINs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        The role and mechanisms involved in high-risk HPV
        induced genomic instability has been of a considerable
        speculation [reviewed in ref. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ]. High-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HPV</ENAMEX> E6
        and E7 gene expression can independently immortalize
        various human cell types 
        in vitro . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E6</NUMEX> gene interacts with
        p53 and an apoptotic protein 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAK</ENAMEX> , followed by its degradation,
        which results in chromosomal instability and resistance to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E7 protein</ENAMEX> interacts with pRB
        followed by its degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> and pRB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have been shown to play multiple roles in cell
        growth and in genomic integrity. There have been
        contradictory reports on targeted 5p deletions in relation
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HPV</ENAMEX> infection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 24</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> have shown
        that 5p deletions occur in significantly high proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> compared to low-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPVtypes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        . Contradictory to this, another study has shown that 5p
        deletions are independent of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HPV16 and HPV18</TIMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        ] . In the present study, we did not find any significant
        differences in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5p</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">LOH</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> harboring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPV16</ENAMEX> and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. However, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> harboring
        HPV16 in combination with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> showed
        significant increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX> loss compared to patients
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">harboring HPV16</ENAMEX> alone. These data, therefore, suggest that
        multiple high-risk HPV infections may have synergistic
        effect in causing genomic instability. Thus, currently it
        is unclear the role of high-risk HPV types in causing 5p
        genomic instability. Further studies are needed to address
        this question.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, the present study confirms our previous
        observations that genetic loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5p</ENAMEX> is a common feature of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. Here we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common sites of
        deletions that harbor candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes on
        this chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> infection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">high-risk HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> may cause targeted genomic instability
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX>. In addition, we have shown that the genetic
        deletions on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX> occur early during the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">high-grade CIN lesions</ENAMEX>. Our identification of minimal
        deletions on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5p</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CINs</ENAMEX> has several potential
        implications. First, it should facilitate the
        identification of the target genes of importance in
        cervical tumorigenesis. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it may provide critical
        genetic markers for identifying cervical intraepithelial
        neoplasias at high-risk to progression.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Tumor and normal tissues
          We analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> tumor biopsies consisting of previously
          untreated primary invasive CCs with the corresponding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood samples</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> formalin-fixed and
          paraffin-embedded CIN specimens. The tissues were
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instituto Nacional</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Cancerologia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX> after appropriate informed
          consent and approval of the protocols by the
          institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX>. The invasive tumors were
          clinically classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIGO</ENAMEX> stage IB (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 tumors</ENAMEX>), IIB
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> tumors), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> tumors), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 tumors</ENAMEX>).
          Histologically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> tumors were classified as squamous
          cell carcinomas and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> as adenocarcinomas. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> CIN
          specimens were classified as high-grade and one as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">low-grade lesions</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SiHa</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SW756</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-4I</ENAMEX>,
          Ca Ski, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-33A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HT-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MS751</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ME-180</ENAMEX> were obtained from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manassas</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>), and were grown in culture according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplier</ENAMEX>'s recommendations.
        
        
          Microdissection, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation and LOH
          analysis
          High-molecular weight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from frozen tumor and the
          corresponding peripheral blood specimens, and frozen
          cells from cell lines was isolated as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Tumor cells from paraffin-embedded CIN
          tissue specimens were isolated by laser capture
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microdissection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arcturus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain View</ENAMEX>, CA) after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methyl</ENAMEX> green-staining and the extraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as
          described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from
          semi-confluent cell cultures using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIzol</ENAMEX> reagent
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. A panel of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> sequence tagged
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphic</ENAMEX> (STRP) (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">di</ENAMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          tetra-nucleotide) markers was chosen on the basis of
          their map position and heterozygosity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Map</ENAMEX>

          polymerase chain reaction (PCR) containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> end-labeled forward primer, analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          on denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels, and scoring
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> on autoradiograms was performed as previously
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . All autoradiograms were visually
          analyzed. Reduction of signal intensity by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> or more of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> allele over the other allele in tumor DNA compared
          with the intensity of constitutional alleles was
          considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>. The definition of minimal region of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletion</ENAMEX> was defined earlier [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> analysis
          was performed at least twice on all tumors with the
          corresponding markers that define the minimal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletions</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PGMY09/11</NUMEX> L1 consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> and reverse
          line blot hybridization system was used to detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genital HPV</ENAMEX> types as described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] .
          Appropriate control experiments were set up using bulk
          master mix components to eliminate potential
          contamination. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> sensitivity was analyzed
          by the use of serial dilutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SiHa</ENAMEX> cell line crude
          cell digest, targeting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          0input copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPV-16</ENAMEX>. A no template negative control
          was set up in all experiments.
        
        
          Analysis of gene expression
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from the cell lines was reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> using random primers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pro-STAR</ENAMEX> first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand RT-PCR</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA).
          Semi-quantitative analysis of gene expression was
          performed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 to 28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of multiplex RT-PCR with
