        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cirrhosis</ENAMEX> is a pathologic condition characterized by
        fibrosis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver parenchyma</ENAMEX> and evidence of
        regenerative activity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It is a common pathologic
        end-point for a number of processes, including damage by
        toxins, metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>,
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>, passive congestion secondary to heart
        failure, or infection with parasites. The epidemiology of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> is linked to both alcohol consumption [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ]
        and the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis C</ENAMEX> virus
        infections [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX>, cirrhosis is the cause of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850 thousand</NUMEX> deaths per year [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The
        majority of these are in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, where viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> is the main underlying cause of cirrhosis. In
        developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is a major cause of cirrhosis,
        but the early mortality risk attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> in
        younger age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-45 years old</TIMEX>) is somewhat offset by
        the proposed beneficial effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> on cardiovascular
        mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        The diagnosis of cirrhosis has both prognostic and
        therapeutic implications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The life expectancies for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> diagnosed with cirrhosis are significantly reduced
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] compared with age and sex-matched controls,
        with the exception of certain pathological subtypes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . The likelihood of variceal bleeding is reported to be
        greatest within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> of diagnosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Owing to the high mortality risk associated with variceal
        hemorrhage, primary prophylaxis against a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bleed
        becomes an important therapeutic intervention [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . There
        are several other therapies that are clinically useful for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , as well as
        therapies for specific causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">viral hepatitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Cirrhosis may be suspected from physical examination
        findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , with imaging studies frequently
        supporting the diagnosis. It is known though, that imaging
        studies are limited in their ability to make a definite
        assessment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with diffuse infiltrative conditions
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ultrasound</ENAMEX>, the most widely used
        modality, is neither sensitive nor specific for the
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Estimates of the
        sensitivity range from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 to 92%</NUMEX> and specificity between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Despite certain limitations, liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX> remains the gold standard for diagnosis. This
        procedure is not without risk. There is a small mortality
        risk of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 0.015 percent</NUMEX>, together with the resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discomfort</ENAMEX> and other non-fatal complications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 22</NUMEX> ] .
        The patchy or regional nature of hepatic changes means that
        percutaneous liver biopsies may miss the diagnosis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the condition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Given the invasive nature of the diagnostic standard,
        there has been interest in whether non-invasive diagnosis
        of cirrhosis might be possible [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 24</NUMEX> ] . Physical
        examination is a diagnostic tool available to every
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinician</ENAMEX>. This study was conducted to review the published
        literature on clinical examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with known
        or suspected liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and identify the validity and
        generalizability of primary studies that distinguished
        those with cirrhosis from those without. A summary of
        diagnostic test performance for elements of the physical
        examination was derived using meta-analytic methods for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostic</ENAMEX> studies. Where possible, effects of study
        characteristics on summary estimates were determined by
        subgroup analysis.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study identification
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> online searches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Library</ENAMEX> of
          Medicine MEDLINE database were performed using the PubMed
          search engine. The searches covered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1966-2000</TIMEX>.
          The last search was completed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 15, 2000</TIMEX>. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> search utilized the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clinical Queries</ENAMEX> tool, using
          the term "cirrhosis", and the options "diagnosis" and
          "specificity". A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> search combined medical subject
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headings</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeSH</ENAMEX>) "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Signs and Symptoms"</ENAMEX>, "Physical
          Examination", and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Medical History Taking"</ENAMEX>, linked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX>
          terms, with a text word search for "cirrhosis", through
          an AND term. The resulting set was further limited by the
          term "human", and by excluding reviews, editorials, or
          letters. The titles of the resulting citations were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scanned</ENAMEX>. Abstracts of potentially relevant articles were
          then retrieved. If the article appeared likely to satisfy
          inclusion criteria from information available in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abstract</ENAMEX>, or if no abstract was available, the full text
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> was evaluated. Additional articles were sought by
          scanning bibliographies in standard reference textbooks,
          proceedings of meetings or conferences on cirrhosis or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>, the reference sections of selected
          articles or review articles on liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, cirrhosis,
          or physical examination, or other potentially relevant
          chapters in books. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of primary studies
          identified through literature searches were contacted by
          letter or by email or both, seeking data not presented in
          the published study, and to enquire about knowledge of
          unpublished or additional studies.
        
        
          Study selection criteria
          Articles were included if they: evaluated patients
          with known or suspected liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or cirrhosis;
          evaluated items obtained by physical examination;
          described liver biopsy results; and provided data
          sufficient to calculate sensitivity and specificity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the clinical examination in the detection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cirrhosis</ENAMEX>. Studies that evaluated only biochemical or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiological</ENAMEX> examinations were excluded.
        
        
          Validity assessment
          The validity of included articles was evaluated for
          the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> criteria [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] by one author
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GdB</ENAMEX>): independent, blind comparison against a reference
          standard of diagnosis; evaluation in an appropriate
          spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; the reference standard was applied,
          regardless of diagnostic test (in this case, physical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">examination</ENAMEX>) result; and the reference standard was
          measured prior to starting any interventions based on the
          examination findings.
          The reference standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis was
          histological evidence of irreversible chronic injury to
          liver parenchyma with extensive fibrosis and formation of
          regenerative nodules. This definition conforms to the
          definition used in the study from which the sensitivity
          of percutaneous biopsy for diagnosis of cirrhosis was
          obtained [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> extraction
          Primary data abstracted from included studies by one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GdB</ENAMEX>). The data was arranged in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> contingency
          tables with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> classified according to the
          presence or absence of a physical sign, given the
          presence or absence of cirrhosis as defined by liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qualitative</ENAMEX> and quantitative study
          characteristics regarding validity, clinical description
          of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, description of the examination
          methods, and applicability, were extracted onto data
          forms.
        
        
          Calculation of summary statistics
          Primary study data for each physical finding was
          analyzed using a computer program, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Meta-Test</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J Lau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analytic approach followed the recommendations of
          Midgette 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and are similar to
          methods outlined in a recent review [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The
          correlation between sensitivity and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-specificity</ENAMEX>) was
          tested using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank correlation coefficient.
          Where sensitivity and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-specificity</ENAMEX>) were significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX>'s ρ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.5</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Summary Receiver</ENAMEX>
          Operating Characteristic (SROC) curve was used to
          summarize the data. Where the correlation between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-specificity</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.5</NUMEX> or negative,
          homogeneity of sensitivity and specificity was tested by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> tests of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. If sensitivity and
          specificity were both homogeneous, a summary estimate of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity were independently derived
          using a random-effects model (REM). If the sensitivity
          and specificity were heterogeneous, no summary estimate
          was derived. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SROC</ENAMEX> curves were created using the
          method described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . The SROC curve
          depicts the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity
          across different studies with explicit or implicit
          variation in test threshold. Unweighted regression
          analyses were examined to determine the SROC curve.
          Symmetry of the SROC curve was confirmed by determining
          whether the slope of the fitted regression line differed
          significantly from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The point of maximum joint
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity was determined from the
          curve, as an overall summary measure. In some instances,
          the SROC curve did not extend to a point where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> is equal to specificity. In those instances,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REM</ENAMEX> summary estimates were used to describe the data.
          Statistical significance was assigned to a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> -value less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Subgroup analyses
          Where a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies per subgroup were
          present, subgroup analyses were planned to determine the
          effects of covariates on estimates of diagnostic
          accuracy. Covariates postulated to be of possible
          significance were: study size (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><100</NUMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≥ 100</ENAMEX>),
          independence of examination and reference standard (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
          point scale - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> = test measured independent of reference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>, and reference standard measured independent of
          test, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = test measured independent of reference but not 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice versa</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> = reference standard
          measured independent of test, but not 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice versa</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> = neither test nor
          reference standard measured independently of each other),
          study design (prospective, retrospective, or
          experimental), and primary etiology of cirrhosis in the
          study population (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, viral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>, or other).
          Residuals of the unweighted regression line describing
          the SROC curve were grouped by the covariate of interest.
          Student's t-test was used to compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Results of literature search
          The trial flow is presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The
          literature searches identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3451</NUMEX> citations. Of these,
          44 titles appeared relevant and were retrieved. Thirteen
          articles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44</NUMEX> ] of
          potential significance were selected for review. A
          further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> articles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 22 24 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55 56 57</NUMEX> ] were found through hand searching
          bibliographic references. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> articles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 40 41</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47 49 51 53 57</NUMEX> ] met inclusion criteria. Of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> studies excluded, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> studies did not report data
          for physical signs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enrolled only cirrhotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> studies did not include sufficient data to calculate
          summary measures of diagnostic accuracy, and one was a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> article. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies grouped data for patients
          with cirrhosis together with data for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with other
          histological <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study characteristics
          Details of clinical characteristics of the study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> for each included study are presented in
          Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> (see Additional file <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1: Additional</TIMEX>
          Table). Included studies enrolled a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> ranged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age from 3 to 90 years</TIMEX>. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> studies that reported gender composition included
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1168</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">628</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>). The median study
          size was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, with an interquartile range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX>. Most of the included studies took place in
          referral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). Detection of persistent
          elevation of aminotransferase levels was the most
          frequent eligibility criterion for study entry ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> studies reported an
          estimated duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, which varied from a total
          duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than six months</TIMEX> to a mean of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 months</TIMEX>. Comorbid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> was mentioned in one study [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] that enrolled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with inherited coagulation
          disorders, usually hemophilia. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> of these patients
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX>) were also infected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> Immunodeficiency
          Virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>).
          The principal causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>, as reported in
          each included study, are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          studies mainly enrolled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 40 44</NUMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mainly with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>-
          related liver disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 49 51 53</NUMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with
          predominantly autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . The remainder
          reported a presumed etiology for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> of the
          study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          Aspects of study design and validity are presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Details regarding the expertise of the clinician
          performing the biopsy were not provided in any of the
          studies. However, it is reasonable to infer that the
          biopsy was performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> clinicians in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least ten</NUMEX>
          of the studies, namely those that originated in referral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> of twelve studies reported that either
          the clinical examination was performed prior to the
          biopsy 
          and that blinded pathologists read
          the biopsy, or that at least the examination was
          performed prior to the biopsy. It was generally not
          stated how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> reviewed the biopsies ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The reliability of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pathological</ENAMEX> diagnosis was assessed in a single study [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> reported that biopsies were
          examined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experienced pathologists. Good agreement
          beyond chance (κ = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX>) was present for the pathological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnoses</ENAMEX> in this study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> other studies stated that
          a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> reviewed the slides [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 51</NUMEX> ] and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> stated that experience pathologists reviewed the
          slides [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> studies, the biopsy was performed irrespective
          of the findings on clinical examination. In the
          case-control study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> did not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">undergo liver biopsy</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 49</NUMEX> ] , it was
          not clear whether the decision to perform the biopsy was
          taken independently of clinical data. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> studies
          reported on exclusions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 40 53 57</NUMEX> ] . These ranged
          from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.7%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>). Common
          reasons for exclusion were: the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contraindications</ENAMEX> to biopsy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> did not undergo
          biopsy, or inadequate biopsy.
          In all studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> were not blinded to other
          clinical information. In some cases, the entire history
          and examination was performed together. In other cases,
          multiple physical signs were evaluated. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> studies
          gave any details regarding the specific clinical methods
          used [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 46</NUMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mentioned the explicit
          threshold for abnormality of a clinical finding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 46</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 57</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> studies did not state how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX>
          assessed each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> studies reported that a
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> was used, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies used two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> to evaluate physical signs. Reliability was
          assessed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 44 46 57</NUMEX> ] , although
          results were only provided in one study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] , and for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">indicants</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> found
          good agreement beyond chance for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver firmness (κ</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.72</NUMEX>), spleen size (κ = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.66</NUMEX>), and stated that agreement
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver enlargement</ENAMEX> was similar (κ not stated).
        
        
          Accuracy of history and physical examination
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> physical signs or findings were reported in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          of more studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SROC</ENAMEX> curves were constructed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splenomegaly</ENAMEX> and hepatomegaly (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>). The data
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ascites</ENAMEX> were unsuitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SROC</ENAMEX> analysis, and so
          were combined using summary measures from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REM</ENAMEX>. The
          maximum joint sensitivity and specificity of the finding
          of splenomegaly was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.64</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> for hepatomegaly.
          A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the
          effect of inclusion of those studies most liable to
          various types of bias. When the case-control study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ]
          was excluded from the analysis of the hepatomegaly data,
          the SROC curve was essentially unchanged. A joint maximum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity for the revised hepatomegaly
          SROC curve was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.75</NUMEX> (data not shown). By comparison,
          exclusion of the study in which clinical and pathological
          assessments were not independent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] from the
          splenomegaly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX> resulted in a dramatic change. The
          SROC curve for this data was greatly influenced by the
          presence of this outlying point. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX>-effects estimates
          for the revised splenomegaly data of sensitivity were
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.82</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>) and specificity <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.60</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.21</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> physical signs were combined using
          summary measures derived from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REM</ENAMEX>, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
          The data for palmar erythema was heterogeneous and
          unsuitable for meta-analysis. Reported sensitivity ranged
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.63</NUMEX> and specificity ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.49</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>. A further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> physical signs were evaluated in
          single studies. The diagnostic accuracy for these
          findings is represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Subgroup analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SROC</ENAMEX> analyses
          Subgroup analyses were possible for splenomegaly and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascites</ENAMEX>. None of the covariates examined, namely: study
          size, study design, etiology of cirrhosis, and
          independence of measurements, resulted in a significant
          difference in diagnostic performance of the physical sign
          in question. There was significant heterogeneity of TPR
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNR</ENAMEX> in the subgroup of studies reporting splenomegaly
          that had assessed biopsy findings with knowledge of the
          clinical findings.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The present study attempted to summarize data from
        primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in the published medical literature on the
        diagnostic accuracy of clinical findings for the diagnosis
        of cirrhosis. The studies identified represent a rather
        select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Studies were primarily conducted in
        referral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> experienced in dealing with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>, seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with increased clinical
        suspicion of the disorder of interest. The underlying
        etiology of liver disease was not comprehensively reported,
        and in several studies, no description of the patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was given. Few studies described their clinical
        methods, where several exist for eliciting a finding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 60</NUMEX> ] . These are deficiencies that should be carefully
        addressed in designing future studies that evaluate aspects
        of clinical practice, such as the history or physical
        examination. These deficiencies are a phenomenon that is
        not restricted to studies of clinical evaluation of liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, adding support to the call for more rigorous
        studies of the clinical examination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] .
        The summary measures derived from the data presented
        here demonstrate that the physical findings elicited in the
        primary studies have high specificity, though generally low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, for detecting cirrhosis. As expected, physical
        signs consistent with advance portal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> or severe
        liver dysfunction (decompensated cirrhosis), like ascites,
        abdominal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall veins</ENAMEX> (collateral circulation), or
        encephalopathy, had high specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 90%</NUMEX>. There was
        significant heterogeneity in the reported diagnostic
        accuracy of palmar erythema, precluding meta-analysis. In
        the case of the physical signs splenomegaly and
        hepatomegaly, studies indicated the presence of a variation
        in test threshold, as an explanation for the variation in
        test accuracy. In the case of splenomegaly, however, this
        finding was sensitive to the inclusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study with
        potential for bias of the diagnostic accuracy of clinical
        evaluation.
        Subgroup analyses were not able to detect variation in
        accuracy as a consequence of study characteristics. The
        small number of studies available conferred low power to
        detect such differences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were insufficient to examine
        other study characteristics that may have influenced study
        outcome, such as age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, cause of liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, or symptom duration. Increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> or duration
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> may bias studies towards higher prevalence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cirrhosis</ENAMEX>.
        The present study employed a comprehensive search
        strategy. Formal criteria for study inclusion were defined
        prior to analysis of the search results. We were unable to
        find previous attempts to summarize the accuracy of
        clinical examination for diagnosis of cirrhosis in the
        medical literature. Our results agree however, with
        comparisons spanning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five decades</TIMEX> of the antemortum
        clinical diagnosis with subsequent autopsy studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ]
        .
        This study has several limitations. Firstly, a question
        remains on the choice of diagnostic reference standard.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Liver biopsy</ENAMEX> is likely to underestimate the actual
        prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Methods to overcome this
        limitation include examining multiple biopsies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study
        required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> successive negative biopsies to exclude the
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Although this approach
        addresses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of sampling variability, it is
        questionable whether it could be considered in future
        studies using biopsy as the gold standard, as it may not be
        ethically defensible. This remains an area for improvement
        in future studies, and consensus on standardization.
        Misclassification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by an imperfect reference
        test will lead to bias in the assessment of a diagnostic
        test [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64</NUMEX> ] . In general, an imperfect reference test
        will underestimate the performance of a diagnostic test.
        Sample calculations to show how such errors in a reference
        test lead to alterations in the apparent sensitivity and
        specificity of a diagnostic test are presented in Appendix
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX> (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices</ENAMEX>). These
        calculations are based on methods developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gart</ENAMEX> and
        Buck [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . As can be seen, a diagnostic test with true
        sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9</NUMEX> would appear to have a sensitivity of
        only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.612</NUMEX> if the reference standard against which it was
        measured had an imperfect sensitivity and specificity of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8 and 0.95</NUMEX>, respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meta</ENAMEX>-analytic methods have been
        described to adjust for imperfections in the reference
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>, although those techniques were not applied to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> presented here [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, it is likely that other types of bias were
        present in some of these studies. Empirical observation of
        the quantitative effects of study design flaws on the
        findings of diagnostic studies has shown that case-control
        designs, studies that use different reference tests for
        positive and negative results of the diagnostic test under
        study, and lack of blinding led to overestimation of
        diagnostic test accuracy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> case-control study
        was retrieved in the searches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . No important
        difference was noted in the hepatomegaly SROC curve,
        whether this particular study was included or not. One
        retrospective study appeared to have a significant risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> from lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blinding</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . The exclusion of this
        study from the splenomegaly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SROC</ENAMEX> significantly altered the
        analysis of this data, showing the vulnerability of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meta</ENAMEX>-analysis to this form of study bias.
        Several other forms of bias have not been shown to be
        important predictors of variation in assessment of
        diagnostic accuracy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] . Selection bias refers to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> that may result if not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the condition
        under study are consecutively included. Such a bias may
        have influenced the results of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> study
        (reference <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>). Verification bias refers to the bias that
        may occur if the reference test is applied based on the
        results of the diagnostic test being studied. Several
        studies were described as having exclusions, which raised
        the possibility of selective application of the gold
        standard. Statistical methods for evaluating diagnostic
        test performance in the presence of such partial
        verification have been described, but require the
        application of a second initial diagnostic test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] .
        Consequently, such an approach was not used in this
        paper.
        Thirdly, the data obtained were insufficient to assess
        the effect of study location on diagnostic accuracy. The
        decrease in specificity of physical signs as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        referred from primary to tertiary care settings, in which
        most of these studies were performed, has been described [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> ] . As most of the studies utilized persistently
        elevated aminotransferase levels as eligibility criteria,
        rather than the physical signs under study, no data are
        available to evaluate whether over- or underrecognition by
        the referring clinicians led to an altered specificity in
        results of the cited article.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, the available data did not allow an analysis of
        how individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> characteristics affect diagnostic
        accuracy of physical findings. It has been observed that
        cirrhosis undetected during life was a finding typical of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, the prevalence of
        certain physical findings, or alternatively the ability to
        detect those signs, may vary between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of different
        race [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, this study cannot assess the independence of
        isolated clinical findings. The role and diagnostic
        accuracy of items from the clinical history were not
        examined. It is likely that some of the study clinicians
        were aware of indicants from the clinical history. Whether
        these elements of the evaluation made clinicians examine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> more intensively than those with a negative
        history is unknown. The possibility also exists that
        finding one physical sign may have heightened attempts by
        examining clinicians to elicit further signs. If clinicians
        utilized additional maneuvers, hence deviating from their
        usual course of clinical examination, on the strength of
        finding other more easily elicited signs, the study results
        may have become biased. The appropriateness of examining an
        isolated clinical sign may also be challenged [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixth</ENAMEX>, data from the primary studies are limited on the
        specific clinical maneuvers used to derive the estimates of
        diagnostic accuracy. Thus, the findings cannot be related
        to the accuracy of a specific clinical approach.
        This study may have implications for how clinicians
        perform and interpret their clinical examination findings.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perloff</ENAMEX> recently drew attention to the ongoing importance
        of skillful clinical evaluation in cardiovascular disease [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> ] . These data show that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cirrhosis,
        individual clinical signs usually have low sensitivity,
        with high specificity. Thus, physical signs cannot be used
        to exclude the diagnosis of cirrhosis, given these
        performance characteristics. Signs are likely to be more
        useful to clinicians in the discrimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> by identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a higher likelihood of
        cirrhosis, thereby "ruling-in" the diagnosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The
        main obstacle to the timely use of such an approach is the
        finding that signs with the highest specificity are those
        present in decompensated disease.
        This study has implications for clinical research. This
        study has highlighted the selected nature of existing data
        on diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and
        measurement parameters for cirrhosis. Attempts to further
        define diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination will
        have to consider how to define and measure independently
        the contribution of individual covariates or physical
        signs, and which combination of cofactors has the highest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, specificity, or positive predictive value. A
        potentially useful consideration would be the gain in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity that might result from using a
        combination of signs. Further attention should be devoted
        to finding ways to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cirrhosis.
        Non-invasive laboratory testing such as serologic or
        molecular markers, imaging studies, or improved biopsy
        techniques appear to be the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> open to
        innovation in this area.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Most studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of
        clinical examination have been undertaken in highly
        selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Physical signs are generally of low sensitivity for
        the diagnosis of cirrhosis, and signs with higher
        specificity are associated with clinically decompensated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, thus no rules of generality can be deduced.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Physical signs are not useful for excluding the
        presence of cirrhosis, but may be useful to indicate the
        presence of cirrhosis in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with moderate to high
        pretest suspicion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Physical signs need to be
        utilized with additional clinical criteria to augment the
        probability of identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cirrhosis.
