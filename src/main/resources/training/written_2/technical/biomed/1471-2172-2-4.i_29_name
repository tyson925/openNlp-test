        Mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bruton</ENAMEX>'s tyrosine kinase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX>) are
        responsible for the human disease termed X-linked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agammaglobulinemia</ENAMEX> (XLA) (reviewed in reference [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]). The
        B cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptor</ENAMEX> (BCR) signaling defect is very
        severe such that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have a block in the pro-B to
        pre-B cell transition and consequently have no mature B
        cells. The 
        xid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is mutated,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Btk knockout mouse</ENAMEX> display similar, although
        somewhat less severe, phenotypes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prototypical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of non-receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine kinases</ENAMEX> (PTKs) that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bmx, Itk</ENAMEX>, Tec
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Txk</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. In addition to a COOH-terminal PTK domain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - terminal pleckstrin homology (PH)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, a proline-rich Tec homology domain, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Src</ENAMEX>-homology
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SH3</NUMEX>) domain and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Src</ENAMEX>-homology <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SH2</NUMEX>) domain. Btk was
        originally identified in B cells but is now known to be
        expressed in most leukocytes with the exception of T cells
        and NK cells.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is thought to be activated upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking by
        a two-step mechanism involving phosphatidylinositol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>)
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Src</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PTK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX> (reviewed in references
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase induces <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> membrane targeting by
        generating phosphatidylinositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>-trisphosphate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PIP3</NUMEX>)
        to which the PH domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> binds. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lyn</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transphosphorylates Btk</ENAMEX> within the activation loop of the
        kinase domain, allowing subsequent autophosphorylation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SH3</ENAMEX> domain and full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> activation. The SH2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain-containing</ENAMEX> inositol phosphatase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHIP</ENAMEX>) downregulates
        Btk by dephosphorylating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PIP3</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient B cells have shown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> to be necessary for BCR-induced phospholipase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-γ2</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PLCγ2</NUMEX>) phosphorylation, calcium mobilization,
        extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jun NH</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -terminal kinase (JNK)
        mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) activation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-κB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and apoptosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. These
        signaling events are generally not entirely abrogated and
        kinetic analyses have revealed that the sustained phases
        are particularly impaired in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8, 9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]. In contrast, these pathways are completely inhibited
        in the absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Syk/ZAP-70</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase Syk
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. These data have led to the hypothesis that Btk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-</ENAMEX>operates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2-dependent</TIMEX> BCR signaling and
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> functions as a signal duration modulator (reviewed
        in references [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>]). However, it is not clear if Btk
        alone is sufficient to mimic aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> signaling, nor
        is it known whether all downstream signals mediated by Btk
        are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2-dependent</TIMEX>. Indeed, additional functions for Btk
        have recently been proposed, namely in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], cytoskeletal reorganization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] and DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21</TIMEX>].
        In this study we have generated a conditional form of
        Btk by fusing the full length Btk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with the
        hormone-binding domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>).
        We show that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> activation alone is sufficient to
        activate multiple downstream signaling pathways in B cells,
        including calcium mobilization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK MAPK</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. Moreover, by analysing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> function in
        PLCγ2-deficient cells, we show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> is necessary for
        Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> to transmit these signals.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>, a conditional form of
          Btk
          In order to determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> activation alone is
          sufficient to mimic aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> signaling, we have
          generated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>, a novel conditional form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX>. Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          was constructed such that the hormone-binding domain of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> was fused to the COOH-terminus of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> length <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). This approach has been
          successful in producing conditional forms of the Tec
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bmx</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], and also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTKs v-Src</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], Hck
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abl</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine kinases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raf</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akt</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], and the dual specificity protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEK1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The mechanism of action of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> is not clear, although it appears that upon
          treatment of cells with estrogen or an estrogen analogue,
          for example <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-hydroxytamoxifen (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-HT</ENAMEX>), the biological
          activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are induced. This may involve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> domain dimerization and/or selective stabilization of
          expression within the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> fusion protein
          method has been shown to accurately identify downstream
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX> and effects of the above mentioned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> were generated, one using
          wild-type (WT) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> and the other using a kinase-inactive
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K430E</NUMEX>) mutant of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> as a negative control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). The
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> constructs were transfected into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient
          DT40 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> B cells and stable clones were selected that
          expressed equivalent levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DT40</NUMEX> cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> was used because it has proved useful in
          dissecting B cell signaling pathways through the use of
          gene knockouts derived by homologous recombination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1Bshows</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> was kinase active 
          in vitro as determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autophosphorylation</ENAMEX> and phosphorylation of an exogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (GST-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Igα</ENAMEX>) in an immune-complex kinase assay.
          Kinase activity was not detectable for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K430E</TIMEX> mutant
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>), comparable to control
          immunoprecipitations from Btk-deficient cells (data not
          shown). In order to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> was active 
          in vivo , cells were treated with
          vehicle control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX>, and the phosphorylation
          status of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> were analysed by
          Western blotting (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>). Upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discrete</ENAMEX> set of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were inducibly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-expressing cells, although
          their phosphorylation levels and the diversity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins phosphorylated</ENAMEX> were reduced in comparison with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking. As a control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment did not
          induce phosphorylation of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in parental
          DT40 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> itself
          was inducibly phosphorylated upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment, as
          measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-phosphotyrosine</ENAMEX> blotting and by a
          phosphospecific antiserum that recognises the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Y223</NUMEX> site
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> autophosphorylation. Surprisingly, the
          phosphospecific antiserum did not detect <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> Y223
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking,
          suggesting that the observed phosphorylation in this case
          is largely due to the Y551 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX> transphosphorylation site.
          In cells expressing kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">phosphorylation of Btk:ER</ENAMEX> was not detected and cellular
          substrates were not inducibly phosphorylated in response
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>). These data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>, but
          not the kinase inactive form, can be activated 
          in vivo by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT. The mechanism by
          which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT activates <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> is not known, but may be
          different to the mechanism of BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>,
          since the two stimuli induce phosphorylation on different
          sites.
          The identity of the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> phosphorylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">downstream of Btk:ER</ENAMEX> activation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-79</NUMEX> kD range, top
          panel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>) are not known. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are unlikely
          to include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn or Syk</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTKs</ENAMEX> that are primarily
          responsible for the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation
          pattern seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DT40</TIMEX> whole cell lysates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], since we
          were unable to detect phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX> and Syk
          following specific immunoprecipitations (data not shown).
          Moreover, the relatively weak phosphorylation of cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">proteins induced by Btk:ER</ENAMEX> does not suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX>
          and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> are becoming activated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1C</ENAMEX>). This is
          consistent with the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> are upstream of
          Btk activation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> is sufficient to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PLCγ2/calcium</ENAMEX>
          pathway
          Btk-deficient B cells are defective in BCR-induced
          PLCγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and calcium mobilization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 11</ENAMEX>].
          In particular, the sustained PLCγ2/calcium responses are
          impaired. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has been proposed in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> controls
          calcium influx across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> membrane by modulating
          PLCγ2 activity and thus IP3 levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 29</ENAMEX>]. Here we
          tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> activation was sufficient to
          activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PLCγ2/calcium pathway.</ENAMEX>
          Btk-deficient cells expressing either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT</ENAMEX> or kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">inactive Btk:ER</ENAMEX> were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX> and
          PLCγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> was analysed by Western blotting
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>). Upon treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT, a sustained PLCγ2
          phosphorylation was induced in cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">WT Btk:ER</ENAMEX>
          that was not observed in cells expressing kinase inactive
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>). As a further control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment of
          Btk-deficient cells, expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> without the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, did not induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PLCγ2 phosphorylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2B</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lanes 9-11</ENAMEX>). This demonstrates that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT response is
          specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, the slow kinetics of
          PLCγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> differed
          markedly from the fast, transient kinetics in response to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-9</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          2B, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-8</ENAMEX>). The slow <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> kinetics are consistent
          with data derived from Btk-deficient cells, in which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sustained BCR-induced PLCγ2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>, calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mobilization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> activation are impaired, but the
          initial responses are relatively normal and appear to be
          driven by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syk</ENAMEX> activity (reviewed in reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]).
          Additionally, the sustained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> phosphorylation induced
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> is in agreement with the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> does not
          activate negative regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> that turn off the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>; rather it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyn</ENAMEX> that is thought to be largely
          responsible for this aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> is sufficient to induce a
          calcium flux, cells were loaded with indo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and the
          concentration of intracellular free calcium monitored by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> analysis. Cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and/or anti-μ
          as outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2C</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, upon treatment with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> induced a rapid calcium mobilization that
          was at a low level but sustained (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2C</ENAMEX>). This pattern
          differed from that seen in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking,
          where an initial large transient increase in
          intracellular calcium was followed by lower but sustained
          levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2C</ENAMEX>). These kinetics are similar to those seen
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> phosphorylation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2A</ENAMEX>,B), again consistent
          with the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> regulates the sustained phase of
          calcium mobilization. No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> or synergistic effect
          of both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and anti-μ was observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2C</ENAMEX>). This data
          indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> activation alone can induce
          intracellular calcium mobilization and is consistent with
          a previous study that showed cross-linking of a
          constitutively membrane associated CD16<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Btk</ENAMEX> chimera to
          induce a calcium flux [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
          In order to evaluate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>-induced calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mobilization</ENAMEX> was due to calcium release from internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> or calcium influx across cell membrane calcium
          release activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (CRAC), cells were pre-treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> to chelate extracellular calcium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2D</ENAMEX>; note
          change in scale within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Dand compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2C</ENAMEX>).
          In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anti-μ</ENAMEX> treatment of cells expressing WT
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>, the sustained elevation of intracellular calcium
          was completely blocked in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, whereas
          the initial transient increase was only slightly
          impaired. Similarly, in response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment, the
          sustained increase in intracellular calcium levels was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abrogated</ENAMEX> in the absence of extracellular calcium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          2D). This suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> may induce calcium release
          from intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> which subsequently results in
          calcium influx across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRAC</ENAMEX>. Our data is consistent with
          that of Fluckiger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], who proposed that Btk
          controls BCR-induced calcium signaling by regulating
          PLCγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IP3</TIMEX> levels and calcium store
          depletion.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2Cshows</ENAMEX> that kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> was unable to
          induce a calcium flux, which, in common with the PLCγ2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>), suggests that kinase activity is required
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> function. However, in the context of signaling
          through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX>, we surprisingly found that kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">inactive Btk:ER</ENAMEX> could reconstitute calcium mobilization
          in these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2C</ENAMEX>). This was not an
          artefact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> domain, since non-tagged kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactive Btk</ENAMEX> could also restore BCR-induced calcium flux
          (data not shown). In addition, we have found that kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactive Btk</ENAMEX> can reconstitute BCR-induced ERK MAPK
          activation, but not PLCγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomlinson</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolen and Johnston</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). This suggests that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> can function independently of catalytic activity,
          perhaps as an adapter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and that Btk-induced PLCγ2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> is not essential for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> activation.
          The mechanism may involve stabilization by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> of the
          PLCγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, or 'signalosome' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], in an optimal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> or subcellular location. Upon BCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is thought to be recruited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX> via
          the adapter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein BLNK</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLNK</ENAMEX> can associate with the
          SH2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> of both PLCγ2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          Membrane localization of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is required for
          PLCγ2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], but the mechanism by which this
          is achieved is presently unknown (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]). It
          is conceivable that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH domain-PIP3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> is
          important for membrane localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and
          that this function is independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> kinase activity.
          However, it should be noted that reconstitution of
          calcium mobilization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient DT40 cells by
          kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> was not observed in a previous study
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but
          may be due to the different mutations that were used to
          generate kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies. In the
          present study we used a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K430E</NUMEX> mutation; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K430</ENAMEX> is the
          invariant lysine known to be essential for enzymatic
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>. In the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takata</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurosaki</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> was rendered catalytically inactive
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an R525Q</TIMEX> mutation. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K430</TIMEX> is located on the
          smaller, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -terminal lobe of the kinase domain,
          whereas R525 is part of the larger, COOH-terminal lobe,
          it is possible that the two mutations differentially
          affect the capacity of kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> to function as
          an adapter in the activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> is sufficient to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and JNK MAPK
          pathways
          BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and JNK MAPK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> is impaired in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient DT40 cells, but p38
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> activation is unaffected [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The precise role of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> in the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathways is not clear, but
          these findings suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activation. We therefore examined whether <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> is
          sufficient to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERK</ENAMEX> and JNK activity.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient cells that express either WT
          or kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT, or PMA
          as a positive control, and ERK activity was assessed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> kinase assay using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBP</ENAMEX> as an exogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. In response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>, but not the
          kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, induced ERK activity which
          increased over the time period examined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>). The
          kinetics were somewhat different to those seen with
          anti-μ stimulation, where maximal ERK activity is
          detected within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-min</TIMEX> and is sustained for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 120</NUMEX>-min
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. However <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> was clearly able to induce sustained
          ERK activity and this, coupled with the findings that in
          Btk-deficient cells the sustained response is impaired [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>], suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> activation may be responsible for
          the prolonged ERK activation normally detected following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking. Interestingly, kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>
          was able to restore ERK activation in the context of
          anti-μ stimulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 and 12</TIMEX>). This effect
          of kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is consistent with the previous
          calcium data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C), and supports the idea that Btk
          can perform a kinase-independent adapter function.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>, JNK activity was measured by Western
          blotting whole cell lysates with phosphospecific JNK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiserum</ENAMEX>. This antiserum detects phosphorylation of JNK
          at sites <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T183 and Y185</TIMEX>, which correlates with JNK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT to cells expressing WT
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER induced JNK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation to a level that was
          similar to that seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anti-μ</ENAMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>, lanes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-4</ENAMEX>) or with both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          However we did not detect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation following
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment of cells expressing kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8-9</ENAMEX>). The weak JNK phosphorylation in
          cells expressing kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>, in response to
          anti-μ or both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>, lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-11</NUMEX>),
          suggests a partial adapter function for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX>. The control
          treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and ionomycin induced JNK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> in both cell types (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). From these data we conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> is
          sufficient to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway in B cells.
        
        
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> is sufficient to induce DT40 cell
          apoptosis
          A major biological response of B cells to BCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linking is apoptosis, a function that is strongly
          induced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DT40</NUMEX> cells. The mechanism of apoptosis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> is not clear but is dependent on the expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. We therefore tested whether the
          conditional form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> alone can induce apoptosis in
          DT40 cells.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient cells expressing either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT</ENAMEX> or
          kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and/or
          anti-μ for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. Apoptosis was quantitatively
          measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> assay, which detects double
          stranded DNA breaks that are a hallmark of apoptosis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> to a similar
          extent to that seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>),
          despite the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>, calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mobilization</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> were relatively weakly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>,B). However, it is clear that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplitude</ENAMEX> and duration of signaling responses can control
          differential activation of transcription factors. For
          example, in B cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-κB is activated by a large,
          transient calcium flux, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> is activated by a
          low, sustained calcium plateau [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Thus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DT40</NUMEX> cells,
          BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> may be largely controlled by
          transcription factors that are themselves activated by
          low, sustained signals, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> can
          activate equivalently.
          A functional kinase domain was required for
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>, as kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>
          failed to induce apoptosis in response to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-HT</ENAMEX> or
          anti-μ stimulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, a low level
          of apoptosis was observed in response to both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and
          anti-μ in cells expressing kinase inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          3C). This again suggests an adapter function for kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive Btk</ENAMEX> which here was facilitated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT. The PMA
          and ionomycin control induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in both cell
          types (data not shown).
        
        
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-induced calcium mobilization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and JNK
          activation, and apoptosis are dependent on PLCγ2
          Biochemical analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient cells have
          suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> is a downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> [
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 11</ENAMEX>]. However, the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX> signaling
          has not been explored. In particular, it is not clear if
          the capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> to connect to downstream signaling
          pathways, such as calcium mobilization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> activation
          and apoptosis, is mediated through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> or whether it
          can occur via other pathways. In particular, recent
          reports have suggested that in addition to PLCγ2
          activation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> may function in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase activation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeletal</ENAMEX> reorganization and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA transcription</ENAMEX>. Btk
          was shown to be required for normal phosphorylation of a
          novel adapter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCAP</ENAMEX>, which couples
          BCR-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTKs</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PI 3-kinase activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Btk
          may also regulate cytoskeletal reorganization by
          phosphorylating the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Wiskott-Aldrich</ENAMEX> syndrome protein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASP</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], which plays a role in actin polymerization.
          Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> has been reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> to the nucleus
          and may function in transcription by binding the
          transcription factors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BAP-135/TFII-I</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 36</TIMEX>]. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> may have multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, and it is
          not known which Btk-induced signals are transmitted via
          PLCγ2.
          To address these questions we have expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> in
          parental and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2-deficient DT40</ENAMEX> cells. Parental DT40
          cells were considered a better control than the
          Btk-deficient cells used previously (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs 1-3</ENAMEX>), as both
          PLCγ2-deficient and parental cells express endogenous
          chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Btk</ENAMEX>. Thus parental and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-deficient cells were
          transfected with kinase active <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> and stable clones
          selected that expressed equivalent levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>, as
          measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Btk Western</ENAMEX> blotting of whole cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4A</ENAMEX>).
          To test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> is required for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>-induced
          calcium mobilization, parental and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-deficient cells
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX>,
          or ionomycin as a positive control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>). Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
          induced a sustained calcium signal in parental cells but
          not in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-deficient cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>), suggesting that
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> modulates calcium signaling by affecting PLCγ2
          activity. Consistent with previous data, no calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mobilization</ENAMEX> was observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-deficient cells in
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], but as expected a calcium flux
          was detected in response to ionomycin, that bypasses
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-proximal signaling events (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 4B</ENAMEX>). These data
          argue against the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> directly
          controls a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRAC</ENAMEX>. Instead, our data are consistent with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> indirectly controls calcium
          signaling by regulating PLCγ2 activity and thus IP3
          levels and calcium store depletion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 8, 29</ENAMEX>].
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5we</ENAMEX> have tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> is required for
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activation, and apoptosis. Two
          different BCR signaling pathways can result in ERK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DT40</NUMEX> cells, namely a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-independent
          Grb2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Sos</ENAMEX> pathway and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-dependent pathway that
          requires <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5Awe</ENAMEX> found that
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK MAPK</ENAMEX> in parental but not in
          PLCγ2-deficient cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 7</TIMEX>). Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>
          appears to induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERK</ENAMEX> activation through its capacity to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activate PLCγ2</ENAMEX>, and not through a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grb2/Sos</ENAMEX> pathway. In
          response to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-min treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX>, ERK
          activation was detected in parental but not in
          PLCγ2-deficient cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-4</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-9</ENAMEX>), but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control PMA</ENAMEX> treatment activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERK</ENAMEX> in both cell types
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 10</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transient ERK</ENAMEX> activation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-min</TIMEX> after anti<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">-μ</ENAMEX> treatment, can be detected in
          PLCγ2-deficient cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. These kinetics are identical
          to those observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Together
          with our <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> data, this suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> controls
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sustained ERK</ENAMEX> activation in B cells by regulating PLCγ2
          activity.
          The mechanism by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> connects to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway
          is not clear. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> can directly
          activate components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MEKK1/SEK1/JNK signaling</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX>. This pathway is controlled by the small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTP-binding protein Rac1</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DT40 cells Rac1</ENAMEX> is
          essential for BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Thus
          another possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> might directly regulate
          Rac1 activity. Alternatively, since the combination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> C and calcium signaling is sufficient to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activate JNK</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 38</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> could activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> indirectly
          through activation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Fig</ENAMEX> 5Bwe show that
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-mediated JNK activation is dependent on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>.
          Upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment, phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> was detected in
          parental cells but not in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-deficient cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). PLCγ2-deficient cells also failed to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activate JNK</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anti-μ</ENAMEX> treatment or a
          combination of anti-μ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4</ENAMEX>),
          whereas parental cells did activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> following these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>, lanes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8-9</ENAMEX>). In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and
          ionomycin, activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JNK</ENAMEX> was detected in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> and
          PLCγ2-deficient cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5B</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 10</TIMEX>). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are in agreement with previous reports that document
          the requirement for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX> in BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>]. Moreover, the data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> activates JNK
          by a mechanism that is dependent on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>, rather than
          through activation of more downstream elements of the JNK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptosis</ENAMEX> is a major biological response of B cells to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR</ENAMEX> cross-linking and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is clearly necessary for this
          effect in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DT40</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. Here we have shown <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> to be sufficient to induce apoptosis in DT40
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5Cwe</ENAMEX> have investigated the
          mechanism by measuring <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in
          parental and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-deficient cells. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT treatment, apoptosis was detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WT</ENAMEX> but
          not in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PLCγ2</NUMEX>-deficient cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5C</ENAMEX>). The response of
          parental cells to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT was consistently lower than in
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5Cand</ENAMEX> data not shown). This is in
          contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient cells analysed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and anti-μ yielded an equivalent apoptotic
          response. This partially impaired function of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> in
          parental cells compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Btk</ENAMEX>-deficient cells, in
          eliciting a biological response, may be due to the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous chicken Btk</ENAMEX> that could compete
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> for optimal subcellular location. Apoptosis
          was not detected above background levels in
          PLCγ2-deficient cells that were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX> or
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-μ</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HT (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5C</ENAMEX>). This is consistent with
          reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> is necessary for BCR-induced apoptosis
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Apoptosis was detected in parental and
          PLCγ2-deficient cells in response to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ionomycin</ENAMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5C</ENAMEX>). These data suggest that
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> induces apoptosis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DT40</TIMEX> B cells by a
          PLCγ2-dependent mechanism.
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DT40</TIMEX> B cells, apoptosis induction by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> may be
          a consequence of its capacity to activate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>, since in
          these cells JNK activation correlates more closely with
          apoptosis than does ERK activation. In particular, we
          have found that Btk-deficient DT40 cells reconstituted
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Txk</ENAMEX>, an atypical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> PTK, fail to undergo
          BCR-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomlinson and Johnston</ENAMEX>,
          unpublished data) and apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation
          is relatively normal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. In contrast to the
          pro-apoptotic role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DT40</NUMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> appears to
          play an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> role in mature B cells 
          in vivo . The mechanism may involve
          Btk-dependent activation of the transcription factor NF-κ
          B [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 10</ENAMEX>] and subsequent upregulation of the
          anti-apoptotic protein <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bcl-X</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40</TIMEX>].
          Previous studies have shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DT40</NUMEX> cells deficient
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> have similar BCR signaling defects.
          Readouts have included calcium mobilization and apoptosis
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 37</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 38</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-κB</ENAMEX> activation
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice deficient</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> have
          similar defects in B cell development and function
          (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]). These findings have lead to the
          hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> are components of the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signaling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, or signalosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. However, these
          findings have not proved that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> connects to the above
          mentioned pathways via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLCγ2</ENAMEX>. In the present study, while
          we cannot rule out the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> activates
          PLCγ2 in combination with other uncharacterized pathways,
          our data strongly support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Btk/PLCγ2</ENAMEX> signalosome model
          by showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> is absolutely required for
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-induced calcium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> and apoptosis responses.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> mutations found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">xid</ENAMEX> mouse show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> is required
        for normal B cell development, but the important pathways
        activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> have yet to be fully identified. In this
        paper we show that a conditional form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>) is
        sufficient to activate many signaling pathways downstream
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> receptor, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCγ2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>,
        calcium mobilization, apoptosis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activation.
        Our findings clearly indicate that all of these
        Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-mediated responses require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">PLCγ2</NUMEX>. In future studies,
        Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> may be a useful tool for the identification of Btk
        phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>, and for the discovery of
        novel substrates.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Cells
          DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX> supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken serum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>),
          penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 </NUMEX>M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercaptoethanol</ENAMEX>. DT40 cells rendered deficient for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">btk</ENAMEX> and 
          plcγ2 by homologous recombination
          were described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 37</TIMEX>].

          and anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y223</ENAMEX> phosphospecific antiserum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] were as
          described. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs were 5H1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] and
          4G10 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upstate Biotechnology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antisera</ENAMEX> against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCγ2</TIMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruz</ENAMEX>, CA), and anti-active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> antiserum was from Promega
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Biochemical analyses
          Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ER proteins</ENAMEX> were activated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-hydroxytamoxifen
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT; Research Biochemicals International</ENAMEX>).
          Immunoprecipitations, immune complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase
          assays, and immunoblotting were as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>]. ERK MAPK assays were as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>
          assays, cells were resuspended in RPMI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX> supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum, and following stimulation
          whole cell lysates were analysed by Western blotting with
          anti-active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> antiserum.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloning</ENAMEX> and transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>
          constructs
          Cloning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse Btk</ENAMEX> was as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
          Kinase-inactive (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K430E</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Btk</ENAMEX> was generated by a two-step
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> mutagenesis strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. To generate <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX>, DNA
          sequences <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">encoding full-length mouse Btk</ENAMEX> were amplified
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Btk</ENAMEX> cDNA using the following primers: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAGTAGGGATCCAGGAAGCCATGGCTGCAGTG-3</ENAMEX>' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAGTAGGGATCCGCGGATTCTTCATCCATC-3</ENAMEX>'. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was
          cloned into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BamHI</ENAMEX> site of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">pBP3:ER</ENAMEX> (pBabepuro
          containing the hormone-binding domain of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HE14</NUMEX> allele
          of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Btk:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> constructs
          were subcloned from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">pBP3:Btk:ER</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> site of
          the pApuroII vector. DT40 cells were transfected with
          pApuroII:<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Btk:ER</ENAMEX> by electroporation and stable clones
          selected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Calcium flux analyses
          DT40 cells were labeled with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 </NUMEX>M <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">indo-1</ENAMEX> AM (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Probes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>, OR) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-min at room temperature. After
          labeling, cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX>
          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM Hepes
          buffer. In some experiments extracellular calcium was
          chelated by pre-treating the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> for
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-min.</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Calcium flux</ENAMEX> was measured using a FACSVantage
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain View</ENAMEX>, CA).
