        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have emerged as a powerful tool to
        monitor the transcript levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes
        simultaneously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This parallel analysis permits
        tumor prognosis and classification [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , drug target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">validation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , toxicology evaluations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , and
        functional discovery [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        The microarray fabrication method can play a key role in
        the performance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray platform. For example,
        oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes can be covalently attached
        to a surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , synthesized 
        in situ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] , or retained
        via electrostatic interactions with a positively charged
        surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . A recent study examining the effect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> along the length of 
        in situ synthesized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligodeoxyribonucleotides</ENAMEX> demonstrated a lack of an effect
        of mismatches for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fifteen bases</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        (surface) end of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide, suggesting
        that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> may not be accessible during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> reaction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Other problems may exist
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligodeoxyribonucleotides</ENAMEX> are adsorbed to a
        positively-charged surface. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes
        have been found to form duplexes with non-helical
        properties on positively charged surfaces [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . These
        duplexes are highly asymmetrical and unwound, possibly
        incurring a significant loss in base stacking which may
        subsequently affect the energetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> formation.
        Such noncanonical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> may not be restricted to
        oligodeoxyribonucleotide arrays. Spotting of amplified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> is another method commonly used to
        fabricate arrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, multi-stranded DNA
        structures have been found to form on the surface of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, a low concentration of
        amplified cDNA in the dispense plate can generate a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compression</ENAMEX> in the expression ratios, underscoring the
        importance of this parameter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Although PCR
        preparation is not a factor in the fabrication of
        oligodeoxyribonucleotide arrays, a similar problem exists,
        namely, surface probe density. Probe density may result in
        steric effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and could affect the efficiency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duplex</ENAMEX> formation and kinetics of target capture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The microarray hybridization conditions can also affect
        the performance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray platform. An early
        study on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarray hybridization</ENAMEX> found that
        hybridization was strongly dependent on the rate constants
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> adsorption/desorption in the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> covered
        regions of the surface, the two-dimensional diffusion
        coefficient, and the size of probes and targets and also
        suggested that sparse probe coverage may provide results
        equal to or better than those obtained with a surface
        totally covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> probes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . A theoretical
        analysis of the kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> hybridization demonstrated
        that diffusion was important in determining the time of
        required to reach equilibrium and was proportional to the
        equilibrium binding constant and to the concentration of
        binding sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . A recent theoretical and
        experimental analysis of competitive hybridization in a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstrated the need for the
        hybridization kinetics of the two probes to be the same [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . An elegant study on the use of hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX> to differentiate specific from non-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> was recently published [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . This study found
        that the hybridization kinetics for specific and
        non-specific binding of labeled cRNA to surface-bound
        oligodeoxyribonucleotides were significantly different,
        with specific binding requiring longer to reach
        hybridization equilibrium than non-specific binding. This
        property was exploited to estimate and correct for the
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization</ENAMEX> contributed by non-specific binding,
        enabling the selection of optimal oligodeoxyribonucleotides
        and the reduction of false positives in exon
        identification. Lastly, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer hybridization time</TIMEX> was
        previously shown to marginally increase relative
        fluorescence, potentially increasing detection of rare
        transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Lastly, oligodeoxyribonucleotide length can impact the
        performance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray platform. Early studies
        with high density arrays suggested the use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mer 
        in situ synthesized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligodeoxyribonucleotides</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . A more recent study using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">covalently</ENAMEX> attached oligodeoxyribonucleotides found that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides generated signals
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-fold higher than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mers, and signals obtained
        form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mers were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>-fold higher than those obtained
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mers but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-fold higher than those obtained from
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 mers</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . In fact, 
        in situ synthesized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mer
        oligodeoxyribonucleotides, hybridized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> formamide,
        have been shown to represent a compromise between maximal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity compared to other lengths and
        hybridization conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Lastly, a study employing
        
        in situ synthesis via maskless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photolithography</ENAMEX> demonstrated an increase in signal
        intensity with increasing oligodeoxyribonucleotide length,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 50</NUMEX> mers, followed by a plateau above that length [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Besides the effects on performance parameters such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity, fabrication methods can also
        affect the accuracy of a microarray platform. A
        sophisticated analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> was
        recently presented [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> used a relative
        error calculation to describe the dependence of the
        accuracy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> on the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs per
        transcript. Furthermore, data was gathered, but not
        presented, regarding the increase in the relative error as
        a function of the fold-change (expression ratio). Such
        issues are important in all microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> and impact
        oligodeoxyribonucleotide design as well as microarray data
        interpretation.
        Thus, it is apparent that many factors can impact the
        performance of a microarray system and that these factors
        should be assessed prior to gathering large amounts of
        microarray data. The fact that the hybridization kinetics
        of specific and non-specific binding differ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] raises
        the questions: what is the optimal hybridization time and
        could the hybridization time affect the accuracy of
        microarray data? Moreover, in order to take advantage of
        the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>-phase hybridization data when
        designing oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes for microarrays
        and when optimizing hybridization conditions, the probes
        attached to the microarray surface or matrix must show
        solution-phase hybridization properties. In this report, we
        show solution-phase hybridization behavior on a
        three-dimensional microarray surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and demonstrate
        that hybridization conditions, specifically the time
        allowed for hybridization, can impact the accuracy of
        fold-change calculations.
      
      
        Results
        The specificity on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CodeLink</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> was previously
        demonstrated to result in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> of the initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> being retained when a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-base mismatch is present in
        the middle of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . We used this information to test whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duplex</ENAMEX> formation is affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>'s attachment to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray surface and to determine how much of the
        probe is accessible for hybridization. A series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-base
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-base mismatches were designed across the length of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer probes to assess its availability for hybridization.
        Labeled cRNA, prepared from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from kidney,
        was hybridized to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarrays consisting of a series of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-base and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-base mismatches across the length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer
        probes containing the mismatches (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The profile of
        these mismatches showed that mismatches near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' (surface) end of the probe affected the
        hybridization signal nearly equivalently, demonstrating
        that the surface did not generate steric effects in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M62388</TIMEX> showed a symmetrical
        profile, with the greatest effect of the mismatches in the
        middle of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). M86443
        showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>) end
        which exhibited only a small effect of mismatches (Figure
        1B). This lack of an effect could be due to the fact that
        the mismatches at those positions did not significantly
        destabilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> or due to the effect of the surface.
        The latter possibility is unlikely but will be addressed
        later. Lastly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NM013226</TIMEX> showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' (surface) end which did not affect the signal intensity
        significantly (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>). This lack of an effect could be
        due to the same reasons outlined for Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>. A total of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were designed and tested in this manner. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of
        those are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> genes
        showed patterns similar to those shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1and</TIMEX>,
        therefore, were not shown for the sake of brevity.
        To show that these hybridization results were similar to
        a solution phase hybridization, melting curve measurements
        were taken in solution using a standard
        temperature-controlled spectrophotometer. The T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of the perfect match and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mismatches
        scanning across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> were measured in both the
        hybridization buffer and in the stringency wash buffer.
        Significantly, the difference in the T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m measurements (Î”T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> ) between the perfect match and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> followed the same pattern as the
        decrease in the hybridization signal on the arrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The strong correlation in the array and solution data
        in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1Bdemonstrate</TIMEX> that the mismatches at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end
        of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide did not destabilize the
        duplex significantly, explaining the lack of a decrease in
        the signal intensity of these mismatches compared to the
        perfect match. Additionally, the patterns for the Î”T 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> calculations from measurements in the
        hybridization buffer (data not shown) and in the stringency
        wash buffer were nearly identical, suggesting that both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and the stringency wash conditions produced
        equivalent stringency. Due to the expense of
        oligoribonucleotide synthesis, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (both
        of which are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were examined for
        concordance of microarray and melting temperature data.
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> data points for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> gene and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> points for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gene (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>)
        showed good concordance between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures. We
        conclude that the three-dimensional surface enables
        solution phase-type hybridization behavior and that most,
        if not all, of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is
        available for hybridization with the target in
        solution.
        The solution phase-type hybridization behavior on the
        microarray surface suggested that probes on this surface
        should exhibit typical hybridization kinetics, where the
        reaction rate is dependent on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order rate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>, the target concentration, and the probe
        concentration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . In other words, increases in the
        target concentration should generate proportional increases
        in the signal intensity. We therefore prepared serial
        dilutions where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> control transcripts were spiked into a
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sample</ENAMEX>. In subsequent samples, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold serial
        dilutions of this spiked total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> into fresh total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        generated a dilution series consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        concentrations of each transcript for a final range of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:100,000 to 1:51,200,000</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> microM to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 nM</NUMEX>). We prepared
        labeled cRNA targets from each of these samples and
        hybridized them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codelink</ENAMEX> microarrays. These microarrays
        contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bacterial probes which were designed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridize</ENAMEX> to each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> spiked transcripts, for a
        total of twelve signals (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Aand six</NUMEX>
        shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) which were measured at each serial
        dilution. Any errors in the measurements will include all
        aspects of the microarray platform. We plotted the signal
        intensity as a function of the spiked transcript
        concentration for oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes on the
        array that were complementary to these control transcripts.
        We found a linear response in the signal intensity from a
        transcript concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> nM to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> microM,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> logs (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Aand 2B</ENAMEX>). This signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linearity</ENAMEX> is consistent with a previously published report
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codelink</ENAMEX> platform [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2value was
        found to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.998 Â± 0.001</NUMEX>. The fact that all twelve of
        these probes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>) demonstrated this behavior suggests
        that this observation is general. However, we could not
        ascertain what portion of the probes which were designed to
        measure the endogenous human transcripts showed this
        behavior because it is not possible to vary the target
        concentration for each of those transcripts in a
        controlled, quantitative manner. In summary, these data
        verified the array signal was indeed dependent on the
        transcript concentration, as anticipated. They also
        demonstrated the precision and low variability of the
        entire microarray process (target prep, labeling,
        hybridization, and detection).
        Mismatched duplexes generally exhibit larger
        dissociation rates than their perfectly matched
        counterparts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . We therefore examined the effect of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-base mismatches as a function of
        hybridization time in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences. A
        hybridization time course was performed by hybridizing the
        same cRNA sample to separate arrays, each array hybridized
        for different times, and examining the hybridization
        intensities for endogenous transcripts. The data in Figure
        3demonstrate that the effect of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> is maximal using a hybridization time equal to or
        greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen hours</TIMEX>. For example, in probe sequence
        X69550 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>), the hybridization signal of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> of that of the perfect match after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> but was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 39%</NUMEX> of that of the perfect match after
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">sixteen hours</TIMEX>. Similarly, the hybridization signal of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-base mismatch was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of that of the perfect match
        after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> but was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14%</NUMEX> of that of the perfect
        match after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen hours</TIMEX>. Identical results were seen for
        the effects of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-base mismatch (data not shown).
        Consistent with previous findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , the effect of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-base mismatch was found to be variable, reducing the
        hybridization signal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>)
        of that of the corresponding perfect match signal. Also
        consistent with previous findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> had a greater effect, reducing the hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>) of that of the
        corresponding perfect match signal. We note that other
        array <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> may generate different effects of
        mismatches due to probe length or to the fact that the cRNA
        used in our experiments was fragmented to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, the actual probe/target <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> length was
        primarily dictated by the length of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> base probe (the
        shorter of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two single strands</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> scenarios could generate the increased specificity
        with time. First, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer hybridization</TIMEX> times, a greater
        proportion of mismatched duplexes (versus perfectly matched
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplexes</ENAMEX>) may have dissociated, resulting in lower
        hybridization intensities for the mismatched duplexes.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, the intensity of the perfect match may increase
        more significantly than that of the mismatch. To determine
        whether one or both scenarios exist, we plotted the
        intensity versus time for the perfect match, one base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> base mismatch probes (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Cand 3D</ENAMEX>).
        While the intensity of the perfect match <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> for
        X69550_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1561</TIMEX> increases with time, reaching a plateau around
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX>, the intensity of both the mismatch probes
        decreases with time, reaching a plateau around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX>
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>). In contrast, while the intensity of the
        perfect match <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">X79067</TIMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3352</TIMEX> increases by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 and 16 hours</TIMEX>, the intensity of the one base
        mismatch probe increases <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 40%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 and 16 hours</TIMEX>
        and the intensity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> base mismatch probe decreases
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 and 16 hours</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>). Thus,
        specificity can be generated in different ways. These data
        provide further evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> phase hybridization
        behavior in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codelink</ENAMEX> microarray system and demonstrate
        that short hybridization times could result in decreased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>.
        It is important to note that the data in Figures 2and
        3do not address the accuracy of the microarray platform.
        For example, the results in Figure 2showed a relative error
        ([fold change expected - fold change observed]/fold change
        expected) of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> which is low compared with higher errors
        reported elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . However, the data exhibited a
        low but consistent compression of the ratios (obtained from
        comparing the signal obtained from one transcript
        concentration to that obtained from the next dilution).
        Therefore, a hybridization time course was performed to
        find the time which would generate the lowest compression
        in the ratios. A simple approach to calculate ratios for
        multiple genes at once (><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) is to vary the
        amount of cRNA used in the hybridization and compare the
        calculated and expected ratios of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. This
        approach eliminates bias which might be introduced when
        solely using control transcripts and it prevents systematic
        errors introduced by the sample preparation method.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the total nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> concentration was kept
        constant by varying the amount of labeled cRNA and
        supplementing the lower amount of labeled cRNA with
        unlabeled cRNA. Therefore, the only variable in these
        experiments was the hybridization time.
        Using this method, a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> would be expected
        from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> if the signal intensity generated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        micrograms of labeled cRNA was compared to that obtained
        from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 micrograms</NUMEX> of labeled cRNA. We acknowledge that this
        is an oversimplification given that some probes will reach
        equilibrium faster than others and that saturation of
        pixels may arise for high signals. However, as a global
        approach, the compression of the ratio, as a function of
        the hybridization time, was investigated. A hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> generated a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
        Significant compression was found if the hybridization time
        was too short or was too long. These results suggested that
        hybridization time could affect the accuracy of ratios by
        introducing a compression effect at shorter times.
        How does the hybridization time affect ratios smaller or
        larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>? Does this compression effect (or the
        relative error) increase with larger ratios? Lastly, how do
        these data compare with other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>? To address these
        questions, we repeated the dilution series experiments
        presented in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2but</ENAMEX> performed the hybridization for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> instead of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hours</TIMEX> that were used to generate
        the data in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. We analyzed both sets of dilution
        series data according to the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abagyan</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] , using the highest concentration of the dilution
        series and determining how the relative error changed over
        a large range of differential expression ratios. We also
        analyzed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhou</ENAMEX> and Abagyan
        publication in this format. We plotted the relative error
        as a function of the fold change for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Codelink</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>,
        using either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an 18- or 24-hour hybridization time</TIMEX> (Figure
        4B). The data points were fit with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order
        polynomial, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2values (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.968 and 0.988</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-
        and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> hybridization times, respectively) showed a
        good fit of the data to the curve. Lastly, when data from
        an analogous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> experiment were plotted in this
        format, the relative error also increased as a function of
        the fold change. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> data plotted were based on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154</NUMEX> data points for each expected fold change,
        thus representing a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">366</ENAMEX> data points. We note that,
        due to the very different conditions used to generate the
        Affymetrix data and to the fact that it is derived from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, these data should not be compared
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codelink</ENAMEX> data. However, these data do demonstrate
        that the increase in relative error with increasing fold
        changes may be a common feature of multiple microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platforms</ENAMEX>.
        The data in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Bhighlighted several</NUMEX> points. First,
        the data using the spiked control transcripts (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>)
        agreed with the data presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Ausing</NUMEX> the
        endogenous transcripts when the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 and 24 hour</TIMEX> timepoints
        were compared and demonstrated that a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> produced more accurate data (less compression or lower
        relative error) than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an 18 hour hybridization time</TIMEX>. We note
        that the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 hour</TIMEX> time point in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Acan</NUMEX> not be compared
        to a similar time point in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 hour</NUMEX>
        hybridization time consistently outperformed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an 18 hour</TIMEX>
        hybridization time, with respect to the relative error, for
        all fold changes examined on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Codelink</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>.
        Thirdly, the relative errors in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> conditions
        (Codelink 18- and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>)
        increased with the larger ratios. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important
        points that should accompany these conclusions. First,
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> use different oligonucleotide lengths
        (from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 to 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in length) and even amplified cDNA
        products [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 10 12 13 22 24</NUMEX> ] , with different
        accessibilities of the array-bound nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. Therefore,
        it is impossible to generalize that a time which is optimal
        on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> will be optimal on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, more studies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codelink</ENAMEX> arrays will be
        required to verify that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> is indeed the optimal. We
        only know that it outperforms the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hour time</TIMEX> points. We
        conclude that a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer hybridization time</TIMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>
        longer) may generate microarray data with lower relative
        errors (while hybridization times of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 hours</TIMEX> could
        generate more compression), and this kinetic parameter
        merits further investigation as a simple method to increase
        both performance (signal intensity and mismatch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificity</ENAMEX>) and accuracy.
      
      
        Discussion
        Much debate exists regarding the optimal
        oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe length. However, a more
        functional way of thinking about the probe length may be
        how many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> are actually available for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and if these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are exhibiting solution
        phase biophysical behavior. In this manner, linker length
        and surface effects must also be considered. For example,
        bases at the surface end of some 
        in situ synthesized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> base
        oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes may not be accessible for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] while other 
        in situ synthesized probes may
        require linkers for optimal performance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . We present
        evidence, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> base oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes,
        that most, if not all, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> is available for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and that the surface does not introduce
        significant steric effects. We note that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">three-dimensional Codelink</ENAMEX> arrays used in this study are
        different from standard surface-bound arrays, and,
        therefore, it is not unexpected that the observations
        presented in this report are different from those generated
        on other array <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, we show, for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time on a microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, a strong concordance
        of microarray hybridization mismatch data with solution
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> melting experiments (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Another important consideration in microarray
        experiments is the time allowed for the hybridization
        reaction. Recent data has shown that specific binding takes
        longer to reach equilibrium than non-specific binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        ] , suggesting that a longer hybridization time may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX>. Implicit in such findings is the fact that the
        accuracy of a fold change may also increase with a longer
        hybridization time. We present evidence demonstrating that
        hybridization time can in fact increase the accuracy of
        expression ratios (fold changes), relieving the observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compression</ENAMEX> in ratios, and that this effect may be more
        dramatic for larger fold changes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In retrospect,
        these data make sense from a biophysical perspective
        because, at the longer hybridization times, the mismatched
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplexes</ENAMEX> will have dissociated due to their faster
        dissociation rates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), leaving primarily the
        perfectly matched duplexes. The optimal hybridization time
        on different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> could vary, depending on probe
        length and accessibility, diffusion coefficients, and
        detection methods, but the basic premise of increased
        accuracy with increased hybridization time should hold.
        Thus, we believe that this parameter merits further
        investigation.
        Various computational and statistical measures have been
        used to improve and filter microarray data. For example,
        locally weighted linear regression (lowess) normalizations
        have been used to correct the systematic dependence of the
        log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the red/green expression ratios on
        hybridization intensity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The finding that
        competitive hybridization in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires
        the hybridization kinetics of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> to be the
        same [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] may help explain the need for such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalizations</ENAMEX>. Thus, understanding the hybridization
        behavior of probes and targets in a microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> may
        obviate the need for large amounts of data
        manipulation.
        Moreover, a recent study found that both cDNA and
        oligodeoxyribonucleotide arrays underestimated the relative
        changes in mRNA expression between experimental and control
        samples, as determined by quantitative reverse
        transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimation</ENAMEX> (or ratio compression) increased as the
        relative change increased, consistent with our observations
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Such comparative studies underscore the need
        to understand the root cause(s) for ratio compression in
        microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> in order to design effective
        solutions. The fact that specific binding takes longer to
        reach equilibrium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and that a longer hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> may alleviate compression in expression ratios (this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>) is one example of how fundamental studies may
        eventually improve microarray data.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The data in this report demonstrate, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time,
        a strong concordance between the effect of mismatches in
        probes attached to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dimensional matrix</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>-based, thermodynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> melting
        studies. Moreover, an increased hybridization time was
        shown to increase the accuracy of fold changes by relieving
        the compression observed in expression ratios, and this
        effect may be more dramatic for larger fold changes.
        Studies such as these may ultimately help improve
        microarray data quality.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Array experiments
          Target preparation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CodeLinkâ„</ENAMEX>¢ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
          hybridization, and processing were performed as described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] except as described. A single, labeled
          nucleotide, biotin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-UTP, was used in the cRNA labeling
          reactions at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX> mM. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unlabeled UTP</ENAMEX>
          was present at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.75</NUMEX> mM, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTP</ENAMEX> were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          mM. cRNA was fragmented prior to the hybridization
          reaction as previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 26</NUMEX> ] .
          Hybridization time studies followed the above procedures
          with the following exceptions. The first sample consisted
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ug of labeled, cRNA target. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sample
          consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ug of labeled cRNA target and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ug of
          unlabeled cRNA target for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ug of cRNA. Each
          target was hybridized to an array for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 8, 14, 18, 24</TIMEX>,
          or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42.5 hours</TIMEX>.
          Serial dilutions were prepared by adding the â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">‰…1000</NUMEX>
          base transcripts from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">araB</ENAMEX> , entF, 
          fixA , and 
          gnd at a final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          Î¼M for each transcript in kidney total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. This <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dilution</ENAMEX> was then diluted into kidney total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold series to a lowest concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.53</NUMEX> nM for
          each transcript. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> nM dilution is approximately
          equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> copy per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, assuming an mRNA population
          which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>/cells, and
          an average mRNA length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> bases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Array design
          The data shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1were</NUMEX> generated using the
          mismatch scanning array. This array consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          probe sets where each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set was designed to hybridize
          to either a spiked, bacterial transcript or an endogenous
          transcript present in a complex human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyA+ RNA</ENAMEX> sample
          (e.g., from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> or human brain). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set
          consisted of the perfect match to the targeted transcript
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subsets. The first subset consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probes</ENAMEX>, each having a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-base mismatch. The position of
          the mismatch was shifted one base for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subset</ENAMEX>, generating a subset of probes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-base
          mismatches scanning the length of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> base sequence.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> subset also consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> probes, each
          having a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-base mismatch. The position of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mismatch</ENAMEX> was shifted one base for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subset</ENAMEX>, generating a subset of probes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-base
          mismatches scanning the length of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> base
          sequence.
          The data shown in Figures 2through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4were</ENAMEX> generated
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Codelinkâ„¢ Human Uniset</ENAMEX> I arrays. These arrays
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,589</NUMEX> probes (representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 9200</NUMEX>
          unique accession numbers) designed to hybridize to human
          transcripts present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyA+ RNA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 386</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> probes (designed to hybridize primarily to
          bacterial transcripts). The noncontrol probes (those
          designed to measure relative expression levels of the
          endogenous human transcripts) were each designed based on
          the paradigm of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> per gene. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          bacterial control probes were designed to hybridize to
          each bacterial transcript. These bacterial probes can be
          used as negative controls or a subset of these can be
          used as positive controls when the corresponding
          bacterial transcripts are spiked into the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyA</ENAMEX>+
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The latter scenario, in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bacterial
          transcripts were spiked into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyA+ RNA</ENAMEX>, was used to
          generate the data shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bacterial probes on the
          array was measured for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> spiked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, for a total of twelve signals which were
          measured at each serial dilution. In addition, the set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> probes contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>, each of which
          contain the perfect match, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-base mismatches to either a bacterial transcript or
          an endogenous human transcript. The intensities of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> was measured after different array
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hybridization</NUMEX> times to generate the data shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Lastly, the probes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Uniset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> arrays which
          were designed to measure the endogenous human transcripts
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyA+ RNA</ENAMEX> were measured after different array
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hybridization</NUMEX> times and with different amounts of labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cRNA</ENAMEX> to generate the data shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A</TIMEX>. The twelve
          probes on these arrays which were designed to hybridize
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> spiked bacterial transcripts were measured
          after different hybridization times and with serial
          dilutions of the bacterial transcripts to generate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>.

          The solution-phase melting temperatures were measured
          with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agilent 8453 UV-VIS</ENAMEX> spectroscopy system with
          added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peltier</ENAMEX> thermostated single cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
          ml quartz cuvette. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>-target set contained a
          perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-mer match and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> pairs with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-base mismatches incorporated into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligodeoxyribonucleotide</ENAMEX>. The oligoribonucleotides (IDT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>) were incubated at room temperature with
          equimolar amounts of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide in
          either in stringency wash solution (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris-Cl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM NaCl</ENAMEX>) or in hybridization buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> formamide<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX> Ã—
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPE</ENAMEX>), then the melting profile was performed in 1Â°C
          increments with constant monitoring at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm. The T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> was determined for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> pair
          by calculating the first derivative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> profile.
