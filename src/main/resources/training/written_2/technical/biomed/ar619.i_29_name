        The precise role played by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenesis</ENAMEX> and inflammation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>)
        is unclear. In the synovial membrane, the most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, suggesting that
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> plays a major role in macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and perpetuation of the inflammatory response [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . CD8 +T cells were recently associated with the
        presence of germinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ,
        suggesting a role for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells in the formation or
        maintenance of those lymphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the synovium.
        Further studies indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells exhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligoclonality</ENAMEX> in the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] and synovial
        fluid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , raising the question of
        whether this oligoclonality is antigen driven. However,
        recent studies have indicated that large numbers of
        virus-specific CD8 +T cells preferentially accumulate in
        the synovial fluid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are
        also oligoclonal, suggesting that non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific
        homing may be responsible for the observed oligoclonality
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells in the synovial fluid [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Because
        chemokines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophage inflammatory protein-1α</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> (regulated upon activation, normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T-cell</ENAMEX> expressed
        and secreted) are expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] ,
        subsets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells may be preferentially recruited
        into the synovial tissue in a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific manner.
        If the expression of chemokines is also accompanied by a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perturbation</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T-cell</ENAMEX> homeostasis in the periphery
        that favors differentiation into cell types that can be
        recruited into the synovium, then a vicious cycle may be
        set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> in which there is continuous generation of CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> cells that can be recruited into the synovium, resulting
        in chronic inflammation and joint destruction.
        Recently, memory CD8 +T cells were classified into three
        distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, based on phenotype [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] : a
        central memory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45RA -CCR7</ENAMEX> +CD62L
        +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD28</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-2</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ -; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> effector memory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>,
        namely the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45RA -CD62L -CCR7 -</ENAMEX>and the terminally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">differentiated CD45RA +CD62L -CCR7</ENAMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        latter effector memory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> contain perforin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secrete</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-γ</ENAMEX> and tumor necrosis factor-α, are cytotoxic,
        and are capable of rapid effector function after
        stimulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] .
        Although a linear model of differentiation has been
        suggested for these memory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (i.e. central memory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T cells CD45RA -CCR7</ENAMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD62L</NUMEX> +→ effector memory T cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45RA -CD62L -CCR7 -→</ENAMEX> effector memory T cells CD45RA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+CD62L -CCR7 -</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ), the exact relationship between
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> is not fully established. Indeed,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Champagne</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] suggested that the
        differentiation may not be linear at all. The central and
        effector memory phenotypes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells in
        peripheral blood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are unknown. Determination
        of these phenotypes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> may provide important insights
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> homeostasis, and we therefore examined the
        distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells into these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subpopulations</ENAMEX> because such a study may reveal differences
        in the differentiation of T cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Decreases
        in some of the subpopulations in peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> may
        indicate that there is a selective migration of these cells
        out of the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, decreased survival of these
        cells, or blockade in their differentiation. Perturbations
        in the homeostasis of memory T cells may play an important
        role in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> by generating effector cells
        that can contribute to the synovial inflammation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.

        Discussion
        The present study shows that the differentiation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells is skewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        and results in an increase in central memory CD45RA -CD62L
        +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells, with a concomitant decrease in terminally
        differentiated effector memory CD45RA +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD62L</NUMEX> -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells.
        The increase in central memory <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45RA -CD62L +T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> was
        also found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        This skewed differentiation was not observed in healthy
        age-matched control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        indicating that this perturbation in homeostasis of T cells
        is a specific feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naïve</ENAMEX>/memory phenotype of T cells has
        previously been investigated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> in numerous studies
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD45RA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45RO</ENAMEX> expression as markers of naïve and
        memory cells, respectively, that approach has suffered from
        the limitation that large numbers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RA</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells
        are actually effector memory cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD45RA/CD45RO</ENAMEX> oversimplification has also resulted in
        rather confusing conclusions regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> homeostasis,
        such as defects in primary T-cell homeostasis based on
        reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell</ENAMEX> receptor excision circle (TREC) levels in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naïve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 +T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45RO -</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . Our findings suggest that reduced TREC levels in the
        CD45RO -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> may not be due to a
        reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRECs</ENAMEX> in naïve cells but rather to reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRECs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD45RA</TIMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RO</NUMEX> -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD62L</NUMEX> -effector memory CD4 +T
        cells. It should be noted that previous studies have
        reported 'false <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naïve</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RA</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +and CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+T</ENAMEX> cells in peripheral blood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ;
        however, the nature of these cells, the exact phenotype,
        and the significance was not known at that time.
        Our finding that peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells exhibit
        increased central memory phenotype and decreased terminally
        differentiated effector memory phenotype suggests that the
        peripheral blood homeostasis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells is perturbed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perturbations</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maturation</ENAMEX> have been
        shown for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific CD8 +T cells, in which there is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of preterminally differentiated CD45RA -CD62L
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 16</NUMEX> ] , and such a lack of
        differentiation may result in functional or homing defects.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> we found a decrease in terminally differentiated
        CD45RA +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD62L</NUMEX> -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells with a concomitant increase in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45RA -CD62L +</ENAMEX>central memory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. If one
        accepts the linear model of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , which
        we note has been challenged [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , then our findings
        indicate that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> there may be an accelerated
        differentiation of naïve cells into central memory CD4 +and
        CD8 +T cells. This accelerated differentiation may be due
        to a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific effect in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> that differentiates
        all peripheral T cells irrespective of their specificity,
        or it may actually reflect an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific expansion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells potentially driven by autoantigen.
        The decrease in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RA</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD62L</NUMEX> -effector memory CD8 +T
        cells in peripheral blood we found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may
        reflect a decrease in the survival of these cells. It
        should be noted, however, that peripheral blood T cells
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do not exhibit an increase in apoptosis in
        
        in vitro cultures, which is in
        contrast to synovial membrane T cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . This may
        suggest that the skewed phenotype of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RA</NUMEX> +CD62L
        -effector memory CD8 +T cells is more likely due to an
        increase in the migration of these cells into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. However, a blockade of the differentiation of
        central memory CD45RA -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD62L</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells into effector
        memory <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells would also result in an increase in the
        central memory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with a concomitant decrease in
        the effector T cells, as observed in the present study.
        Studies of the phenotype of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells in the synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and fluid may shed light as to whether this skewed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> is also found in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or whether there is
        an enrichment for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RA</NUMEX> +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD62L</NUMEX> -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells, indicating
        increased recruitment into the inflamed synovium in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inflammation</ENAMEX> and production of chemokines such as
        macrophage inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-1α</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] in
        the synovium may result in preferential recruitment of such
        effector memory CD8 +T cells (which are important
        contributors to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ production) and subsequent macrophage
        activation, because terminally differentiated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD45RA</NUMEX> +CD62L
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells have been shown to express higher levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perforin</ENAMEX> and may be more potent effector cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The
        question arises of whether the observed skewed
        differentiation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        receiving steroid treatment. However, the skewed memory
        phenotype was only observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, suggesting
        that this treatment is not responsible for the differences
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T-cell</ENAMEX> phenotypes.
        Findings from the present preliminary study show that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral blood</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> exhibit a skewed
        effector memory phenotype. This skewed phenotype was not
        found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +T cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and was not seen in age-matched
        healthy control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The skewed
        phenotype may be a result of accelerated differentiation
        and migration into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of inflammation. An understanding
        of the mechanisms that are involved in this skewed
        differentiation of effector memory CD8 +T cells may prove
        valuable in elucidating the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In peripheral blood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> a skewed homeostasis
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +T cells was found, with an increase in central
        memory and a decrease in terminally differentiated effector
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memory T</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T-cell</ENAMEX> phenotype was
        not found in healthy age- and sex-matched control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>. Reduction in
        peripheral blood effector memory CD8 +T cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> may
        indicate an increase in the migration of these cells into
        sites of inflammation, and therefore may contribute to
        ongoing synovial inflammation.
