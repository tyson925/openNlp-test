        Ecto-Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-NTPDases</ENAMEX>, formerly called ecto-ATPases) hydrolyze
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> in the presence of divalent cations and are
        insensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-type</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>type, and V-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> isoforms that differ in the ratio of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase/ADPase</ENAMEX> activity are present on the cell surface [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        ] : <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-NTPDase1</ENAMEX> with a ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-NTPDase2</ENAMEX> with a ratio
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-NTPDase3</ENAMEX> with a ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-5</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPDases</ENAMEX> are
        important in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">physiological</ENAMEX> processes like cell
        motility, adhesion, nonsynaptic information transfer,
        secretion, regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPDases</ENAMEX> will
        help description of their physiological functions, and
        development of strategies to regulate the functions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX>.
        The catalytic mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPDases</ENAMEX> is not known even
        though some basic facts of the catalysis have been
        established. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPDases</ENAMEX> do not form phosphorylated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediates</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">catalysis</TIMEX>, a conclusion also supported
        by lack of vanadate sensitivity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pi</ENAMEX> product inhibition [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . The catalytic reaction appears to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irreversible</ENAMEX> and no partial reactions have been observed [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . Divalent cations like Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+are required for
        activity, and maximal activity is reached when the
        concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The specific activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPDases</ENAMEX> vary over a
        broad range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato apyrase</ENAMEX> to
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> gizzard ecto-ATPase
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Sequence comparisons indicate that most of
        NTPDases contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> highly conserved regions, apyrase
        conserved region, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACR1 - ACR5</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11</ENAMEX> ] . However, the
        catalytic sites have not been identified, although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACR1</TIMEX> and
        ACR4 have been implicated in β- and γ-phosphate binding,
        respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        E-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NTPDase1</NUMEX> is also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD39</ENAMEX>, as it was first
        described as an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> present on activated B and T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Residues</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ACR1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ACR5</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD39</ENAMEX> have been
        mutated to study the involvement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACR</ENAMEX> regions in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX>. E174 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACR3 and S218</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACR4</TIMEX> are required for
        catalytic function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Substitution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">H59</ENAMEX> in ACR1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">converted CD39</ENAMEX> into an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADPase</ENAMEX> in a quaternary structure
        dependent manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">W187A</ENAMEX> in ACR3
        affected CD39 folding and translocation, while mutation of
        W459A in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACR5</TIMEX> increased ATPase activity but diminished
        ADPase activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Mutations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D62 and G64</TIMEX> of ACR1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D219</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">G221</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACR4</TIMEX> demonstrated that the nucleotide
        phosphate binding domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPDases</ENAMEX> are similar to those
        present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actin</ENAMEX>/heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein/sugar</ENAMEX> kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . These results suggest that the
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ACR1</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> regions are involved in
        the catalytic mechanism of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD39</TIMEX>.
        The catalytic activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD39</ENAMEX> is dependent on the
        presence of divalent cations. Since the interactions of Ca
        +2and Mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+2with proteins</ENAMEX> are difficult to study due to the
        lack of spectroscopic properties, vanadyl (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V IV=O</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+has
        been used as a probe of the ligands that compose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mn</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+binding sites of several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxypeptidase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , S-adenosylmethionine synthetase [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , pyruvate kinase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , and F 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -ATPase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . This cation
        specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of
        several enzymes, and in many cases serves as a functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cofactor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanadyl</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> axial and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> equatorial
        coordination sites relative to the axis of the
        double-bounded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, an arrangement that is similar to
        that for Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+. As it is known that the 
        A and 
        g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tensors</ENAMEX> derived from the EPR spectrum
        of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+are a direct measure of the nature of the
        equatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal ligands</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+to CD39
        could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of
        CD39.
        Recently we reported that a recombinant soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD39</ENAMEX>,
        capable of hydrolyzing both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX>, was expressed and
        purified from insect cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX>
        nucleotide-binding site was identified on the purified
        soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD39</ENAMEX> in the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+when non-hydrolysable
        nucleotide analogs were used. In this report, we
        characterized the signals that were obtained from bound VO
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the
        purified soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD39</ENAMEX>. The possible metal ligands for VO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2at</ENAMEX> the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic
        mechanism is discussed.

          concentrations of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> increased and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
          decreased as the incubation time was prolonged (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B).
          The ATPase activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25%</NUMEX> of

          aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH7.0</NUMEX> in the absence of chelator and

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . The rate of precipitation depends
          on the abundance and affinity of the chelator. This means
          that the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration was lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM.
          This result indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+can functionally
          substitute for Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+as cofactor for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX> nucleotidase

          || of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.9455</NUMEX>, which corresponded to
          species D2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b). The signal intensity from the bound
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> accounted only for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5%</NUMEX> of that
          of species T from bound non-hydrolysable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-ADPNP

          The same sample made from mixing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and sCD39
          was incubated at room temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, then
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-EPR spectrum was generated as shown in Figures
          4cand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4d</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPR</ENAMEX> parameters derived from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-EPR

          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2. However, the signal intensity decreased
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 37.5</NUMEX> fold compared to that obtained before room

          The parallel transitions of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-EPR spectrum are
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The features derived from the VO

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">||</ENAMEX> , which was designed as species V
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6b). The signal intensity of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+accounted

          The best fit of equatorial ligands for species V

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanadyl</ENAMEX> has been used to estimate the types of groups
        that serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>-ligands in F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> and other enzymes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> and A tensors of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">51V</NUMEX> hyperfine
        couplings are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately</NUMEX> a linear combination of tensors
        from each type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that contributes an equatorial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 27</NUMEX> ] . By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+in the presence of different nucleotides, we show that
        the interaction of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD39</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> is different from
        that with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX>.
        It is not surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+can functionally replace
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+in the hydrolysis of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> by soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD39</ENAMEX>,
        although the enzymatic activity is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25%</NUMEX> of that with
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+as the cofactor, since F 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> also hydrolyzes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> at a
        decreased rate when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+replaces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPR</ENAMEX> features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+are able to reveal some details
        about how CD39 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolyzes ATP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX>. A single EPR
        feature, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species T</ENAMEX>, was observed when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADPNP</ENAMEX> (a
        non-hydrolyzable analog of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>) complexed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was
        bound to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX>, which is consistent with the presence of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> nucleotide binding site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">g and A</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tensors</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species T</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9410</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">504.25</NUMEX> MHz
        respectively, which can be fitted best with one amino group
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> combined from carboxyl and phosphate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as the equatorial ligands of the bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+on
        sCD39. In accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> complex coordination on
        other enzymes that hydrolyze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, like F 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -ATPase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 28</NUMEX> ] , the γ- and
        β-phosphate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> most likely bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+while the third
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is contributed by a side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of aspartate
        or glutamate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX>. It is not unusual for the ε-amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of lysine to coordinate with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> in enzymes. It
        has been reported that the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> serves as one of VO
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+equatorial ligands in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 -ATPase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , pyruvate kinase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdoMet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">synthetase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , and carboxypeptidase [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . Thus one amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from lysine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> carboxyl group
        from aspartate or glutamate, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> oxygens from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphates</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADPNP</ENAMEX> serve as the equatorial ligands of
        sCD39 bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADPNP</ENAMEX>.
        In the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPCP</ENAMEX>, bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> EPR
        features, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2 that are separated by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX>. As we have reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sCD39</ENAMEX> releases
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediate ADP</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> is further cleaved during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX> probably has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conformations
        that bind metal-ADP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, one is the conformation that
        releases the ADP intermediate, and another that recruits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediate ADP</ENAMEX> back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis
        to AMP. However, intact CD39 does not release intermediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis, suggesting that there is only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ADP binding site on each CD39 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> in the intact
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 25</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">EPR species</ENAMEX> observed with VO
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPCP</ENAMEX> probably correspond to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
        conformations of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> at the same catalytic site on
        sCD39. The signal intensity of the bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-AMPCP EPR
        spectrum indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D1 is dominant over species
        D2. In order to further assign species <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1 and D2</TIMEX> to the two
        different conformations, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiments were done (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Incubation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-AMPCP at room
        temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the
        intensity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2, while the signal intensity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species D1</ENAMEX> remained unchanged. These data indicate that VO
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-AMPCP was released from the conformation corresponding
        to species D2; however, the conformation corresponding to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species D1</ENAMEX> still had bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-AMPCP. More evidence for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectra</ENAMEX> of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. No species <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> was found
        presumably because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> was converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> before the
        sample was frozen. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2 was observed and its
        intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged.
        We suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the conformation
        that releases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> as an intermediate product and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the conformation that binds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. The lower signal intensities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D1 and
        D2 compared to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species T</ENAMEX> suggest that the affinity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sCD39</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> or its analog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPCP</ENAMEX> is lower than that for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP analog ADPNP</ENAMEX>, which is consistent with the result
        that only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> analogs were detected on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sCD39</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        The calculated g 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">||</ENAMEX> and A 
        || values that best matched the
        experimental values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2 suggest that one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygens</ENAMEX> derived from carboxyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-ADP. Since the conformation corresponding to species
        D2 is found in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> and is likely to be the
        conformation that releases bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2-ADP</ENAMEX>, it is likely
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2ligands</ENAMEX> are one phosphate and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> carboxyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> is the substrate and generates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">species D1</ENAMEX>, one water molecule and a combination of three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> between carboxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and phosphates serve as the
        equatorial ligands of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX>. The probable
        combination of carboxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and phosphates for species
        D1 is one carboxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphates</ENAMEX> since VO
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> ADP through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two phosphates</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> is
        bound to the enzyme.
        The site directed mutagenesis studies on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD39</TIMEX> and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD39</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> give some hints about the
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that serve as metal ligands at the
        catalytic site of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX>. The changes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D62</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACR1</TIMEX>, E174
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ACR3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D213</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D219</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HB6</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S218</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACR4</ENAMEX> dramatically
        decrease both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> and ADPase activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD39</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 15</NUMEX>
        ] . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7summarizes</NUMEX> the possible coordination of Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D1, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2 in
        the different situations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sCD39</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catalysis</ENAMEX>. The catalytic
        base attack results in cleavage of the γ-phosphate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> carboxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> replaces the γ-phosphate as a metal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> (from species T to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D2), which is accompanied
        by a swap of an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with a hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S218</TIMEX>?).
        This hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S218</TIMEX>?) probably interacts with the
        water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation
        corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> D1 to hydrolyze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX>. The constant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that appears in all conformations of sCD39
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX> is likely contributed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D213</TIMEX> since it is close
        to S218.
        The results presented here also provide an explanation
        to the free metal inhibition of CD39 catalytic activity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+binds to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX>. Once free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+occupies the catalytic
        site, the enzyme has to either release the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> or correct
        the conformation before the substrates are recruited
        properly.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+can functionally substitute for Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+as a cofactor
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sCD39</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> different EPR spectra are obtained for VO
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the
        absence of nucleotide. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligands</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+2in</ENAMEX> the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> are suggested to be carboxyl and amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, while those in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> are probably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxyl</ENAMEX> and hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The mechanism of sCD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX> is discussed. These results will provide guides

          Preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+solution
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanadyl</ENAMEX> and nucleotide solution were prepared
          according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houseman et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Dissolved molecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> was removed from solutions by purging with dry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrogen gas</ENAMEX>. Stock vanadyl and nucleotide solution were
          thawed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, and mixed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 molar</TIMEX> ratio by vigorous
          stirring. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were added to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sCD39</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 molar</TIMEX> ratio, mixed, and incubated
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> before they were transferred into
          EPR tubes. Once the samples were in EPR tubes, they were
          immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in
          liquid nitrogen before using.
        
        
          EPR Measurement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW-EPR</ENAMEX> experiments were carried out at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-band (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> GHz)
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300E</ENAMEX> spectrometer with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TE102</NUMEX> rectangular
          standard cavity and a liquid nitrogen flow cryostat
          operating at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Simulations</ENAMEX> of these EPR spectra were
          accomplished with the computer program QPOWA [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ]
          ).
          To estimate the types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that serve as
          equatorial ligands to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VO</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+in each condition, the
          observed values of A 
          || derived from simulation of the EPR
          spectrum by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QPOWA</ENAMEX> were compared with the coupling
          constants obtained from model studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 32</NUMEX> ]
          using:
          A
