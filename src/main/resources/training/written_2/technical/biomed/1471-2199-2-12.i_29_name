        The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1plays</ENAMEX> an
        important role in regulating cell cycle progression by
        inhibiting the cyclin-Cdk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> responsible for
        promoting the transition from G1-phase to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        In normal cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1levels</ENAMEX> are high in GO and decrease
        rapidly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late G1</TIMEX> allowing entry into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-phase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1has</ENAMEX> also been implicated as playing a role in tumor
        formation and progression. 
        p27 Kip1knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> display
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> organ hyperplasia and are highly prone to
        pituitary adenomas [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . In human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, such as
        breast [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , prostate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , colorectal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and
        others, low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1expression</ENAMEX> correlate with
        decreased survival rates. Since mutations of the 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1gene</TIMEX> are rare in cancer cells
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , loss of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27 Kip1must</TIMEX> involve changes in the
        mechanisms that control its expression.
        Changes in the levels of cellular p27 Kip1are regulated
        by multiple mechanisms. In general, transcriptional control
        of the 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1gene</ENAMEX> is believed to play a
        minor role in regulating p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1expression</TIMEX>. However,
        recent reports indicate that transcription of the 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1gene</ENAMEX> can be activated by
        neuronal differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vitamin</ENAMEX> D3
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] , interferon and cytokines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , and
        exposure to hypoxic conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] or xenobiotics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        . Transcription of the 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1gene</ENAMEX> can be negatively
        regulated by growth factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">by c-Myc</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Some of the growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> and cytokine effects on 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1transcription</ENAMEX> may be mediated
        by the forkhead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription factors that appear
        to be regulated downstream of the phosphatidylinositol
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kinase signaling pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . The use of
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> leading to multiple transcription
        start sites, as reported here, suggests an additional type
        of transcriptional control.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-transcriptional</ENAMEX> controls appear to be the major
        regulatory mechanisms that determine the levels of p27
        Kip1in the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . These include ubiquitination and
        proteasomal degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and sequestration and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mislocalization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p27 Kip1protein</TIMEX>. In addition,
        changes in the rate of 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kip1mRNA</ENAMEX> translation have been
        shown to be important in regulating cellular p27
        Kip1levels. The rate of 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kip1mRNA</ENAMEX> translation is higher in
        quiescent cells than in growth factor stimulated cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1translation</ENAMEX> is also enhanced during
        differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HL60 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Recent studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        untranslated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> ) of the 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1mRNA</TIMEX> are able to enhance
        translational efficiency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] and several proteins
        that bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> have been identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The
        mouse 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> has recently been shown to be
        able to mediate cap-independent initiation of translation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . In addition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-rich element within the 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> may be involved in regulating 
        p27 Kip1mRNA stability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        Together, these findings clearly demonstrate the importance
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> in controlling cellular p27
        Kip1levels. However, from the work published to date it is
        not clear what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> constitute the full 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> in either human or mouse.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is determined by the site of
        transcription initiation and several papers have reported
        putative 
        p27 Kip1transcription initiation
        sites. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwon et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] reported a major
        transcription start site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> start codon. They also reported a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> transcription
        initiation site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">253 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the start
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] reported that the
        mouse 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Kip1transcription</NUMEX> start site is
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the start codon. They found no
        evidence for the downstream initiation sites reported by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwon et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The gene sequences upstream of the 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Kip1start</NUMEX> codon, including the
        putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions, are highly conserved between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human. However, it has been reported that the 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Kip1transcription</NUMEX> start site in
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 153 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the AUG
        start codon [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 35</NUMEX> ] . In contrast to these findings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ito</ENAMEX>
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] reported multiple start sites in the region
        from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">403 to 479 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> as well as
        minor sites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">273 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG.</ENAMEX>
        Thus, for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1genes</TIMEX> there are discrepancies
        between the reported transcription start sites. In
        addition, despite the high level of conservation in 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Kip1gene</NUMEX> sequences, the reports
        in the literature show no correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and
        human initiation sites, which would result in very
        different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> in the final 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1mRNAs</TIMEX>.
        Given the importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> in governing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1levels</ENAMEX> and
        the disparity among the reports described above, we felt it
        necessary to further investigate the 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Kip1gene</NUMEX> transcription initiation
        sites. We have used a method that accurately identifies the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">capped 5</ENAMEX>'-end of mRNAs together with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX>. Our data indicate that the major transcription
        start site is at exactly the same sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> and that transcription initiation from this
        site produces a 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">502</NUMEX> nucleotides in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">472</NUMEX> nucleotides in human. These findings represent
        important sequence information relevant to studies being
        done on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27 Kip1levels</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Determination of transcription initiation sites
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA ligase</ENAMEX>-mediated rapid amplification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' cDNA
          ends (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RLM-RACE</ENAMEX>)
          To identify transcription initiation sites, RLM-RACE
          was performed. This method has a major advantage over
          other methods of mapping transcription start sites, such
          as primer extension, nuclease protection assays, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traditional 5</ENAMEX>' RACE, in that only authentic capped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'
          ends of mRNAs are detected. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in RLM-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> is
          treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample with phosphatase. This
          removes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' phosphate from incomplete mRNA fragments
          and from non-mRNAs eliminating their ability to
          participate in subsequent ligation reactions. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step of the procedure the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-methylguanosine cap of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNAs</ENAMEX> is removed using a pyrophosphatase that leaves a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. These full-length decapped mRNAs are
          thus the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules that can be ligated to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          oligonucleotide adapter in the next step of the
          procedure. Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> are reverse transcribed
          followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification using a gene-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> and a primer homologous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide
          adapter.
          This procedure was carried out using total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from
          the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3T3</ENAMEX> cell line, the non-transformed human
          MRC5 cell line, and the human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX>.
          The initial PCR was performed using a primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complimentary</ENAMEX> to the 
          p27 Kip1mRNA sequence <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just</NUMEX> upstream
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> start codon (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Band 2C</ENAMEX>) together with
          the adapter primer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nested PCR</ENAMEX> was then performed using
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product as a template and the gene specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Band 2C</ENAMEX>. The nested PCR
          products were then cloned and sequenced.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bands were obtained after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RACE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nested PCR</ENAMEX> reaction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) with estimated sizes of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200, 250</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs, with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> base pair band
          being the most intense. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloning</ENAMEX> and sequencing of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, each
          preceded by a sequence corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          oligonucleotide adapter and thus representing authentic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap</ENAMEX> sites. These sites map to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">502</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> translation start codon
          in the mouse 
          p27 Kip1gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B).
          When the RLM-RACE procedure was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          from the non-transformed human MRC5 cell line a single
          major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 480</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs was observed
          after the initial PCR reaction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). With the human
          MCF7 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell line two bands of approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">480 and 400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs were observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). Nested
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> confirmed these bands and revealed several faint
          bands of various sizes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Direct cloning of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RLM-RACE products</ENAMEX> followed by sequencing demonstrated
          that the major mRNA cap site in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MRC5</NUMEX> cells is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">472</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCF7</TIMEX>, cap
          sites were observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">472</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">403 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> start codon.
          By gel purifying DNA fragments from the faint bands
          obtained after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the nested PCR</TIMEX> reactions and then
          reamplifying, it was possible to obtain additional
          clones. These presumably correspond to minor start sites
          that map to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">677</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">316</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">289 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the
          
          p27 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Kip1start</NUMEX> codon in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCF7</NUMEX> cells.
          Using this procedure for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MRC5</NUMEX> cells we were able to
          detect a minor cap site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">403 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          Determination of transcription initiation sites
          using ribonuclease protection
          The RLM-RACE procedure identifies authentic
          transcription start sites but does not provide a
          quantitative measure of the efficiency at which the
          various sites are used. To verify the results of the
          RLM-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> and to provide a measure of transcription start
          site usage an RNase protection assay was employed.
          Labeled antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> were made by in vitro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> using the cDNA sequence of the most
          abundant, longer transcripts identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' RLM-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> as
          a template. The human probe was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">535 nucleotides</NUMEX> in
          length, consisting of 
          p27 Kip1sequences from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 to 472</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> with the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleotides</ENAMEX> derived from non- 
          p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1sequences</TIMEX>. The mouse probe
          was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">565 nucleotides</NUMEX> in length and included 
          p27 Kip1sequences from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 to 502</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG.</ENAMEX> The labeled probes were
          hybridized with total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> followed
          by digestion with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> and analysis of the protected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> on denaturing acrylamide gels.
          Using either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> 3T3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) or mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3B) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assay resulted in a
          single predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> with an estimated size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">480</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>, arrows). This corresponds to
          the distal cap site detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RLM-RACE 502</ENAMEX> nucleotides
          upstream of the AUG. Very faint bands of approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190 and 230</NUMEX> nucleotides (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>, brackets) were
          also detected and these correspond to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> cap
          sites mapped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RLM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> 3T3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, an
          additional faint band of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 350</NUMEX> nucleotides
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, arrowhead) was detected. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> does not
          correspond to any known transcription start site. The
          various protected fragments were quantified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densitometry</ENAMEX>. After correction for length, the major band
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~480 nucleotides</NUMEX> represents ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.6 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> Kip1mRNAs
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81.25 %</NUMEX> in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. The other
          protected bands represent approximately equal proportions
          of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p27</NUMEX> Kip1mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assays were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate human cell lines, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MRC5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCF7</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BT20</TIMEX>.
          For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> lines a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 450</NUMEX>
          nucleotides was observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, arrow). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the major transcription initiation site
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">472 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> as identified by
          RLM-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, it was previously reported that the major
        transcription initiation site for 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Kip1is</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream
        of the start codon with a minor start site <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX> nucleotides
        upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . We also detected transcription
        start sites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">253 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> but
        have shown that these are only rarely used. The RLM-RACE
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assays described here show that the
        overwhelming majority of mouse 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1transcripts</TIMEX> are initiated at
        a position <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">502 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX>. This is
        true for both mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3T3</NUMEX> cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lin</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , using nuclease protection assays, estimated the
        mouse 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip1start</ENAMEX> site to be 495
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> start codon. Our results
        agree with these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> but precisely position the
        start site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">502 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG.</ENAMEX>
        In human cell lines, the major transcription initiation
        site is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">472 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX>. Both RNase
        protection assays and RLM-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 4</ENAMEX>) demonstrate
        this. This site exactly equates to the major transcription
        start site in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RLM-RACE</ENAMEX> we were also
        able to detect minor cap sites in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>. An
        initiation site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">403 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> was
        easily identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCF7</TIMEX> human breast cancer cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and a significant portion of the initial clones were
        derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> capped at this site. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> of
        the initial clones from the RLM-RACE procedure using the
        non-transformed human MRC5 cell line were from products
        capped <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">472 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AUG. By</ENAMEX> gel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> and reamplification we were able to detect
        additional cap sites <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">677, 316</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">289 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream
        of the AUG. However, these can only be very minor start
        sites since they were rarely observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RLM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> and were
        not detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assays. Using an RLM-RACE
        procedure similar to that used for this study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ito et al.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] mapped a cluster of transcription start sites
        surrounding nucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">472</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX>. However,
        their data did not demonstrate which site within this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> served as the major initiation site.
        In another study the transcription initiation site for
        the human 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1gene</TIMEX> was reported to be 153
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 35</NUMEX> ] . The experiments
        reported here do not support these findings. Using
        RLM-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX>, a faint band of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs
        could be observed after nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), but we were
        unable to clone an authentic RACE product equating to a
        start site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">153 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG. In</ENAMEX>
        addition, no bands corresponding to a start site at this
        position were detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assays
        indicating that, if there is a transcriptional start site
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX>, it is extremely rarely used in any of the cell
        lines that we tested. The 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is predicted to have extensive
        secondary structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . It is possible that this could
        interfere with primer extension analysis, which was used by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minami et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] to map the putative transcription
        initiation site in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>. It is also possible that
        differences exist between the cell types used here and
        those used in previous reports. However, this is unlikely
        since we observed exactly the same results with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        separate human cell lines.
        Both the mouse and human 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Kip1promoter</NUMEX> regions have
        previously been characterized using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructs</ENAMEX>. All of the constructs that have significant
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity contain the major
        transcriptional start sites identified in this study [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . Mouse 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Kip1reporter</NUMEX> constructs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing ~500</ENAMEX> base pairs upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> start codon
        had virtually no activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . Similarly a human 
        p27 Kip1reporter construct containing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> was inactive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        Our data indicate that this is because these constructs did
        not carry the major transcription initiation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or the
        promoter sequences necessary to position the transcription
        complex. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the major
        transcription start site for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">positioned ~</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs downstream of an AT-rich element
        that may serve as a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX>. This element in the 
        p27 Kip1gene (TTTAAT) matches the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">consensus TATA box sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATAA/TAA/T</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        positions.
        It has been shown that expression of 
        p27 Kip1is controlled at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translational</ENAMEX> level [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 26 29</ENAMEX> ] and that the 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is able to mediate enhanced
        translation rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In addition, it was recently
        reported that the 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> has an internal ribosome entry
        site that allows cap-independent initiation of translation
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . However, none of these reports have utilized the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full 5</TIMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> that results from transcription
        initiation at the major start site. The longest fragments
        of the 
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kip15</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> that have been analyzed include
        only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">153 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUG</ENAMEX> for
        human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> nucleotides for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . It is
        very likely that the additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~300 nucleotides</NUMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        end of the major 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1transcript</TIMEX>, as reported here,
        will play an important role in regulating p27
        Kip1expression. It will therefore be necessary to
        re-examine translational control of 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1in</TIMEX> the context of its full
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>. 
        The data presented here show that, although there is a
        single major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>, there are also alternative transcription
        initiation sites for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1</TIMEX>. This adds a new dimension
        to studies on 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1expression</TIMEX>. One interesting
        possibility is that different start sites may be used at
        different points in the cell cycle or during cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. It is known that 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1mRNA</TIMEX> levels stay relatively
        steady throughout the cell cycle. However, usage of various
        transcription start sites could be regulated differently.
        This might affect the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and thus translation of the 
        p27 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kip1mRNA</TIMEX>. Additional studies will
        need to be done to determine if and when different
        transcription start sites are used.
        The region of the 
        p27 <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Kip1gene</NUMEX> upstream of the ATG
        start codon is highly conserved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This includes the region encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region. The high
        conservation between the mouse and human genes extends at
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least an additional 300 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the
        sequences shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Our data indicate that
        the major transcription start site is at exactly the same
        sequence in both human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, large arrows).
        Based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these new</TIMEX> results, we propose usage of the gene
        numbering system shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> +1 is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">502</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> and for human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+1</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">472</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX>. This information should be
        useful in designing experiments to analyze both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> and translation control of p27
        Kip1expression.

          Human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCF7 and BT20</TIMEX>, human
          fetal lung cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MRC5</NUMEX>, and the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3T3</ENAMEX> cell
          line were maintained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s
          medium with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          extracted using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRI Reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Research</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>) and stored in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' RLM-RACE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RLM-RACE</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ] was performed using the
          GeneRacer kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). In short, the
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX> then decapped using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrophosphatase</ENAMEX> to target full-length messenger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>. An
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> was then ligated to the full-length,
          decapped mRNAs and reverse transcription was performed
          using random primers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was done to amplify the
          resultant cDNAs using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneRacer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' primer and a
          primer consisting of bases immediately upstream of the

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTTTCTCCCGGGTCTGCACGACCG</ENAMEX> for human and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTTCCTCCTCGGGCGGGTGT</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nested PCR</ENAMEX> was then done
          to eliminate the possibility of artifacts using the

          p27 Kip1primers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CACGACCGCCTCTCTCGCACTCTC</ENAMEX> for human and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGACCACCGCCTCGCCTCTC</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cloning</ENAMEX> and sequencing
          The RACE nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were cloned into the
          pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector using a TOPO-cloning kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> obtained from the resultant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          was sequenced with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USB Sequenase</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> DNA
          Sequencing kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T3</ENAMEX> and T7

          Ribonuclease protection assay
          For the ribonuclease protection assays, probes were
          made using the MAXIscript kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>),
          32P-CTP, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the RACE nested

          or the mouse 
          p27 Kip1sequence from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-502</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-17</NUMEX>
          was linearized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pme</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and used as a template for
          probe synthesis. Numbering of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> was
          assigned using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX> as the translation start site. After
          gel purification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, the assay was carried out
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HybSpeed RPA</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>). Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-precipitated with the labeled probe followed by

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/T1</ENAMEX>, the protected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> were precipitated and run
          on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoradiography</ENAMEX>.
