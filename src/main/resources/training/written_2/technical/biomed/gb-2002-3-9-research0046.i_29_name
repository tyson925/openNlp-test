        Among the many challenges that microarrays present to
        both bioinformaticists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, data communication
        is one of the most significant. This stems from the fact
        that, unlike biological sequences, microarray data requires
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> structures that are both multidimensional and varied,
        and no natural or standard ways to move results between
        research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> yet exist. This applies to both the
        underlying gene-expression data and the descriptive
        biological annotations that provide context for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression measurements. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of papers have now
        been published, but no more than a handful have presented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in the same format, and none has provided adequate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contextual</ENAMEX> information to allow reproduction of
        experiments.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX> (the microarray gene
        expression data <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) has been wrestling with
        standards-based microarray data exchange. Recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX> has
        published a specification describing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIAME</ENAMEX>, the minimal
        information for the annotation of a microarray experiment [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIAME</ENAMEX> is based on the consensus of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX> conferences (for more information
        see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]) and specifies which data and contextual
        information should be supplied when a microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression dataset is published. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> (for
        example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX> ) have begun to endorse or
        encourage MIAME compliance for papers describing the
        results of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. It is expected (indeed
        hoped) that in the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and funding agencies
        will require MIAME-compliant data for continued funding and
        publishing, respectively.
        It is not enough to specify that certain data and
        accessory information be provided. It is essential, if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIAME</ENAMEX> is to be useful, that a standard transmission format
        exists for the data. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> have
        previously responded to this need by developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XML</ENAMEX>-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-communication syntaxes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEML</ENAMEX>, gene expression markup language [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] from Rosetta
        Inpharmatics, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAML</ENAMEX>, microarray markup language from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> (extensible markup language) is a set of rules
        whereby new vocabularies may themselves be defined. In some
        respects it is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTML</ENAMEX>, in that tags are used to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encode</ENAMEX> information, but in HTML the information is related
        to the formatting of a document, using a predefined set of
        tags. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX>, the tags do not indicate how a document
        should be formatted, but instead provide semantic context
        to the content of the document. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> vocabularies define
        their own tags, and thus use XML to hold information in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> such that that information can be understood. Because
        of this, and the wide support that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> has received since
        its release as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">W3C</NUMEX> recommendation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] both GEML
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAML</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> for encoding microarray data. Usually an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> document is not a stand-alone document, but will refer
        to another document, called the document type definition,
        or DTD. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DTD</ENAMEX> contains a set of rules, or 'declarations',
        that specify which tags can be used, and what they contain.
        It is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTD</ENAMEX> that we specify in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> documents
        created to use MAGE-ML will refer to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTD</ENAMEX>. In response
        to a request for proposals from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMG</ENAMEX> (object management
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]) for methods of communicating gene-expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEML</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAML</ENAMEX> submitted their
        vocabularies as potential solutions to this problem.
      
      
        Results
        
          The object model: MAGE-OM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX> is a data-centric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX>
          classes grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> packages containing, in total,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> attributes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between classes.
          Classes in our model represent distinct things or events,
          and each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> may have attributes as well as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> to other classes. A list of the MAGE-OM
          packages and the classes contained within each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> are
          listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The packages are used to organize
          classes that share a common purpose, for example the
          Array package contains classes that describe individual
          arrays, including detailed information on relevant
          manufacturing processes. The key components of MAGE-OM
          reflect many of the core requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIAME</ENAMEX>,
          specifically: experiment goals and design (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Experiment</ENAMEX>
          package); biological materials used and description of
          their creation (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BioMaterial</ENAMEX> package); array design and
          purpose (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayDesign, BioSequence</ENAMEX> packages); array
          manufacture (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Array</ENAMEX> package); hybridization, wash, and
          scan information (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BioAssay</ENAMEX> package); gene-expression data
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BioAssayData</ENAMEX> package).
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> packages support requirements shared by
          the above components, specifically information on people
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, protocols used, simple annotations,
          free-text descriptions, and the ability to specify links
          to predefined ontologies such as those provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Mapping of biological experiments to MAGE-OM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX> provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for the logical flow of
          experiments using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> requirements listed above.
          While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is not a laboratory information
          management system (LIMS), laboratory information does
          have a critical role in understanding microarray data,
          and much of this information is accounted for in our
          model (for example, protocols and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for clones used
          in manufacturing microarrays). A conceptualized model of
          the biological work-flow modified from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the OMG
          submission document is presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workflow</ENAMEX> is based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parallel processes - the
          manufacture of microarrays, and the generation of
          biological samples - that come together in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. A detailed breakdown of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and its
          relation to the workflow are presented below.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Descriptions</ENAMEX> and protocols
          During the design of MAGE we recognized that despite
          all efforts it would be impossible to create a model that
          would be completely expressive for all microarray
          experiments. Thus, to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extensible</ENAMEX> experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> that allow additional
          information to be associated with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> in the
          model were included. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are Annotation
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Description</ENAMEX>; all model components can be annotated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with an instance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annotation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, and
          many can be described. Annotations are simple mechanisms
          for storing local parameters, using name/value/type (NVT)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>. Descriptions are a method of providing
          extra information allowing both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NVTs</ENAMEX> and free text: for
          example, MAGE-OM allows users to describe protocols (as
          well as experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>, see below) using
          free-text descriptions. From a database and computational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, structured annotations are preferable
          because they facilitate searches and automated data
          processing (see below).
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other key components of the
          Description package: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Databases, DatabaseEntries</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OntologyEntries</ENAMEX>. Databases are references to external
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of information such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> or the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saccharomyces Genome Database</ENAMEX>,
          whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DatabaseEntries</ENAMEX> refer to individual records in
          those databases. OntologyEntries are a mechanism by which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> can use commonly defined terms to aid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>. In designing MAGE it was recognized that
          it would be impossible to specify fully all the many
          possible parameters and their allowable values, but it
          was important that a flexible and extensible mechanism
          existed to support this possibility. Thus, the model
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contains OntologyEntries</ENAMEX>, whose roles are named to fit
          their purpose; for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioSequences</ENAMEX> has an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OntologyEntry</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'species</ENAMEX>', which should be used to
          refer to an entry in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> taxonomy database.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX> model provides a rich mechanism for
          describing protocols and their use. Protocols can use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> (hardware) and software, as well as have a list
          of parameters whose values can change between individual
          uses of the protocol. The use of a protocol, termed a
          ProtocolApplication, involves specifying the values for
          each of the protocol parameters, as well as setting the
          protocol parameters for any hardware or software used. To
          encode a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction using this method the protocol
          could describe the thermal cycling conditions and the
          make<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/</ENAMEX>model of the instrument, while the protocol
          application might give the sequences of the primers and
          the serial number of the thermal cycler. Another example
          would be to define the feature-extraction protocol
          whereby data were extracted from a scanned microarray
          image, which would have a reference to a piece of
          software. The software might have parameters for the
          layout of the features (spacing and position) and the
          background calculation method.
        
        
          Array information
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX> packages in the object model, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ArrayDesign</ENAMEX>,
          Array, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DesignElement</ENAMEX>, contain information regarding
          the design, manufacture and contents of microarrays. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DesignElement</ENAMEX> package is arguably the most complex of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to specify information about the
          biological materials deposited on an array. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayDesign</ENAMEX> package stores the intended pattern of
          individual array elements, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Array</ENAMEX> package
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> information on the actual events that produced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. ArrayDesigns allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to specify the
          protocol used, a relevant contact, the grids structure,
          and which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DesignElements</ENAMEX> are present in the
          design.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">DesignElements: Features</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompositeSequences</ENAMEX>. Features represent a
          unique address on the array, specified either using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartesian</ENAMEX> or logical coordinates (zone/sector, row,
          column). It is important to note that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX>, Features
          do not possess substantial biological information; only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompositeSequences</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioSequenes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> level of
          DesignElement abstraction, and correspond to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
          features. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporter models</ENAMEX> a physical sequence, and thus
          if exactly the same biological sequence is spotted on an
          array twice, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Features</ENAMEX>, both of these Features are
          represented by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporter</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expressed
          sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) clones mapping to the same UniGene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> are represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX>, as
          would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct oligonucleotides which map to the
          same open reading frame.
          CompositeSequences are the highest level of
          abstraction, allowing multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX> or multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompositeSequences</ENAMEX> to be combined so that data can be
          mapped to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> that are longer than the lengths
          of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporters</ENAMEX>. Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previously
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mentioned ESTs</ENAMEX> that map to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster can
          be grouped in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompositeSequence</ENAMEX> that represents that
          UniGene cluster. It is important to note that the
          CompositeSequence with which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reporter</ENAMEX> may be associated
          is dynamic, as gene predictions in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> become
          more refined. In addition, the biological annotation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompositeSequence</ENAMEX> is also dynamic, as
          our knowledge of the functions of genes, and the
          processes in which they participate, changes over time. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompositeSequence</ENAMEX> should not be merely thought of as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'gene'</ENAMEX>. There are many different types of sequence
          features in a genome, such as centromeres, telomeres,
          intergenic regions, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX>.
          Even a 'gene' itself has several components, such as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, and introns and exons, as well as potential
          signals in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CompositeSequence</ENAMEX> can theoretically be used to represent
          any of these, or even a chromosome itself.
          The Array package stores information on arrays created
          on the basis of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayDesign</ENAMEX>. This includes the
          manufacturing protocols, contacts, and details of the
          exact materials used for each Feature. It is important to
          note that the materials are actually BioMaterials
          (described below), which allows them to be very detailed;
          examples include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions based on different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiable cDNA</ENAMEX> clones. Position changes and other
          feature defects can be recorded for each array. To
          accommodate some manufacturing processes, arrays may be
          part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayGroup</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> distinct arrays that are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesized</ENAMEX> and distributed as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayGroup</ENAMEX> also records the locations of signifying marks
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fiducials</NUMEX>) and details about the array's substrate.
        
        
          Preparation of experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>,
          hybridizations, and scans
          Experimental samples from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> are termed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMaterials</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX>, with key subclasses being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioSource, BioSample</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LabeledExtract</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioSource</ENAMEX>
          is used to designate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the innate</TIMEX> (or starting) properties
          of a sample, such as genotype, age, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and disease
          state. Each of these properties is set by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OntologyEntries</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMaterial</ENAMEX> is derived
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BioMaterials</ENAMEX> through Treatment events,
          which also specify the protocol and amount(s) of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMaterial</ENAMEX>(s) used. The treatment provides an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> to the action <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ontology-Entry</ENAMEX>. Examples of
          common terms in this ontology might be: add, centrifuge,
          and incubate. Each treatment also has an optional
          actionMeasurement that would allow relevant values to be
          stored. Together, action and actionMeasurement might be
          used to specify "incubate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>". <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMaterials</ENAMEX> can
          be designated as being of a certain type (an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OntologyEntry</ENAMEX>) such as the MIAME concept of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Extract</ENAMEX>,
          so that the role in the laboratory can be specified. The
          final BioMaterial is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LabeledExtract</ENAMEX>, which is also
          created by a treatment event from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMaterials</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LabeledExtract</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> to labels (compounds
          that will be used to measure the abundance of components
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LabeledExtract</ENAMEX>).
          In the workflow above, an Array and one or more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMaterials</ENAMEX> (for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color microarrays this would be two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labeled-Extracts</ENAMEX>) are combined to create a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhysicalBioAssay</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BioEvent</ENAMEX> model used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX>-OM
          allows for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioEvent</ENAMEX> to be applied to a
          PhysicalBioAssay, to create a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhysicalBioAssay</ENAMEX>, for
          example, a washing event can be applied to the above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhysicalBioAssay</ENAMEX> to create a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PhysicalBioAssay</ENAMEX>. One
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized BioAssayTreatment</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImageAcquisition</ENAMEX>,
          the product of which has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
          Images. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeasuredBioAssay</ENAMEX> is generated by the
          FeatureExtraction event operating on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhysicalBioAssay</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FeatureExtraction</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Software</ENAMEX> guided and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeasuredBioAssay</ENAMEX> has an association with the numeric data
          that are produced (that is, the tab-delimited data output
          by the scanner software). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeasuredBioAssays</ENAMEX> can be
          processed or combined by a Transformation producing a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DerivedBioAssay</ENAMEX>. Again, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DerivedBioAssay</ENAMEX> is not
          numeric data, its data are obtained through an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DerivedBioAssayData</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> model and storage
          The data model is perhaps the most complex aspect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX>. We view the data as a three-dimensional matrix
          (or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX>) of values whose axes are labeled by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Design-Elements</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'genes'</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BioAssays</ENAMEX> ('experimental
          samples'), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QuantitationTypes</ENAMEX> (parameters from the
          scanning software). Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2ashows</ENAMEX> data for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          DesignElements, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuantitationTypes</ENAMEX> and a single
          BioAssay, which is similar to the table of data generally
          presented by a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FeatureExtraction</ENAMEX> event. The
          QuantitationTypes shown include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel 1 Foreground</ENAMEX> and
          Background, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel 2 Foreground</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Background</ENAMEX>, and the
          ratio between the background subtracted intensities of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel 2</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel 1</ENAMEX>.
          QuantitationTypes are the types of data that are
          communicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments and can be either
          Standard or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> types. StandardQuantitationTypes
          were designed to allow <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to understand the
          structure and meaning of the gene-expression data. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StandardQuantitationTypes</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MeasuredSignal</ENAMEX> (that
          is, intensity), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DerivedSignal</ENAMEX> (background subtracted
          intensity), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ratio</ENAMEX> (the result of dividing one signal by
          another), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PresentAbsent</ENAMEX> (enumerated evaluation of
          presence). There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more
          StandardQuantitationTypes: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PValue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Error</ENAMEX> (standard
          deviation), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ExpectedValue</ENAMEX>, which are
          ConfidenceIndicators, meaning that their values modify or
          describe another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QuantitationType</ENAMEX>. For example, if a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>'s relative expression between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMaterials</ENAMEX> is
          known by another experimental method to be unchanged,
          then the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ExpectedValue of the Ratio</ENAMEX> should be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.00</NUMEX>, while
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ratio</ENAMEX> itself might be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.08</NUMEX>. This ability allows
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> values to be included in the gene-expression data
          so others can evaluate the accuracy and reliability of
          the measurements provided. Each StandardQuantitationType
          has an optional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX> and a designator
          indicating whether the value refers to the background or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foreground</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpecializedQuantitationTypes</ENAMEX> are user
          defined; possible examples include the number of pixels
          in each feature, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the pixel-by-pixel</NUMEX> correlation
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels within a feature.
          The matrix of values is represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> as
          either a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> of values (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioAssayDataCube</ENAMEX>), or as value
          coordinate tuples (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioDataTuples</ENAMEX>). Both of these data
          sources share BioAssayDimensions that identify all of the
          DesignElements, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QuantitationTypes</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BioAssays</ENAMEX> used.
          Each of the dimensions of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> specifies the order of
          the values along <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> axis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Experiments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX>'s highest-level object is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Experiment</ENAMEX>, a
          collection of results for one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BioAssay</ENAMEX>(s), the
          intent of which is to communicate the biological
          properties tested. Experiments have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExperimentDesign</ENAMEX>,
          which records the following key <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MIAME</ENAMEX> requirements:
          replicate; quality and data-processing information (in
          free-text form); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ontology-Entries</ENAMEX> describing the type of
          experiment; and a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExperimentalFactors</ENAMEX> (the
          parameters of the experiment). For example, a simple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression time course could vary cell density and
          glucose concentration over time; these would be the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExperimentalFactors</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExperimentalFactor</ENAMEX> also has an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FactorValues</ENAMEX>, which hold the values for
          each of the factors for each <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">BioAssay in the Experiment</ENAMEX>.
          This will facilitate queries of gene-expression
          repositories where a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> might wish to find all
          experiments that varied the dosage of exposure to a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Experiment</ENAMEX> also has a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Providers</ENAMEX> who are
          the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Contacts for the Experiment</ENAMEX> (the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">experimenters</ENAMEX> themselves).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Experiment</ENAMEX> also has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> to analyses
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HigherLevelAnalyses</ENAMEX>) that go beyond the recorded data.
          Typical examples might include clustered results (from
          hierarchical or k-means clustering) or results from
          self-organizing maps. More complex HigherLevelAnalyses
          might include predictions of gene function, experiment
          class (for example, tumor classification), or associated
          regulatory sequences (transcription factor binding
          sites).
          At present the model only contains a limited framework
          supporting node- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-based clusters. Each clustering
          has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> to the data from which the results
          were generated as well as one or more nodes. Each node
          can contain other nodes to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> or it can
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more dimensions, allowing the node to
          identify which of the matrix indices are clustered
          together (for example, a node might contain a
          DesignElementDimension with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          MAGE-ML
          A few simple rules were used to translate MAGE-OM into
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTD</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX>. First, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> in the object
          model is represented as an element with an attribute list
          matching the attributes of the class. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> element having the
          role's name with 'assn' appended to the end is created.
          Further, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is by reference 'ref is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appended</ENAMEX> and if the cardinality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> 'list' is appended. For example, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Person</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'affiliation'</ENAMEX>, by
          reference to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX>. In the XML this would
          appear as:
          <Person identifier="Person1" name="John
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doe</ENAMEX>">
          <Affiliation_assnref>
          <Organization_refidentifier="ABC Inc."=/>
          </Affiliation_assnref>
          </Person>
          We have adopted this strict naming scheme so that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> is predictable and so that future additions and
          extensions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> will be compatible. Several special
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are also created: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (MAGE-ML);
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for each of the packages in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>; and a list
          element that each identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> within a package
          receives and that serves to organize each instances of
          that class. The packages ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> is modular,
          so that, for example, related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayDesigns</ENAMEX>,
          DesignElements, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioSequences</ENAMEX> can be stored in
          different documents.
        
        
          Production uses of MAGE
          There is substantial evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX> is a useful
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX>. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta Biosoftware</ENAMEX> has used GEML
          (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX>) as an internal data-communication
          standard for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, primarily as an intermediate
          step in their data pipeline. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rosetta</ENAMEX> pipeline
          principally included data associated with array design,
          printing, scanning and feature extraction. Their XML
          format handles many technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>, including
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-channel ratio data and single-channel intensity data.
          At a minimum, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEML</ENAMEX> has shown that an XML format can work
          very well for a disconnected high-throughput internal
          pipeline. It showed that the large amount of data in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression experiments can be effectively encoded in
          an XML format and also showed that a single experiment
          can be spread through several documents and/or data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and linked using common identifiers.
          More recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> Bioinformatics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Institute</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBI</ENAMEX>) has begun using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX> as the basis for the
          ArrayExpress gene-expression database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. ArrayExpress
          is a relational implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX> that can
          import, and in the near future, export <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> documents.
          This project has proved that there is more value to
          MAGE-OM than just an easier-to-read MAGE-ML
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX>; database schema, various software pieces
          for data loading and access, as well as templates for web
          pages were automatically generated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX>. Although
          this effort is just beginning, a number of submissions
          have been successfully entered into the database.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> has also implemented MAGE-compliant
          software, particularly an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exporter</ENAMEX> application
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">programmers interface</ENAMEX> (API) in a software component
          called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the 'Expression Data Access Component Exporter</ENAMEX>' or
          'EDAC-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Exporter</ENAMEX>' that will export <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> experiment
          result data files to MAGE-ML-compliant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> documents.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> is further providing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBI</ENAMEX>'s ArrayExpress
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> files with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayDesign, DesignElement</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioSequence</ENAMEX> information to facilitate submissions of
          experimental data ]from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChips</ENAMEX> and queries
          of this data within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayExpress</ENAMEX>.
          Finally the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCI</ENAMEX>) has over
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> experiments, including oligo, spotted array, CGH
          (comparative genome hybridization), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> (serial
          analysis of gene expression) experiments in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX> (which is based on MAGE). Currently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCI</ENAMEX>
          database can generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> documents for all submitted
          experiments.
        
        
          The software toolkit: MAGE-STK
          We do not expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will access and use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> directly. Instead, we have developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of
          software tools based on MAGE-OM that is collectively
          called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-STK</ENAMEX>. These tools define an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">API</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> currently supports three
          implementations: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-Perl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-Java</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAGE-C++</ENAMEX>. Each
          of the APIs use similarly named methods and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> to
          provide access to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. The goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-STK</ENAMEX> is
          to provide an intermediate object layer that can then be
          used to export data to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX>, to store data in a
          persistent data store such as a relational database, or
          as input to software-analysis tools.
          Currently, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">API</ENAMEX> provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> packages load a set of MAGE-ML
          documents into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">API</ENAMEX>, creating a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>;
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> packages create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> document from a
          collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">API</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>.
          Because there is no public adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX> to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relational</ENAMEX> database schema, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APIs</ENAMEX> must be mapped to
          and from a site's local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (that is, their database
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schema</ENAMEX>) before use. Once this is done, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> will be
          able to share (and receive) data from other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> in
          an unambiguous and predictable format - MAGE-ML. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Projects</ENAMEX>
          are currently underway which map <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX> to a relational
          database schema (see, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ArrayExpress</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]),
          and as soon as such a public database schema exists, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APIs</ENAMEX> will provide a default set of mappings to that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schema</ENAMEX>.
          As addressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIAME</ENAMEX>, one of the current shortcomings
          of public microarray data is the lack of sufficient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contextual</ENAMEX> information. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the next goals of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-STK</ENAMEX> project is to develop tools for annotating MAGE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The overriding goal is to create tools that make it
          less burdensome on the experimenter to annotate his or
          her experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIAME</ENAMEX> currently specifies a large amount
          of annotation as required for the 'minimal' amount. MIAME
          will live or die by whether it is reasonable to provide
          this level of annotation, not whether it is unreasonable
          not to. Thus tools that allow a user rapidly and
          accurately to annotate microarrays, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          microarrays, or even related experiments, are of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramount</ENAMEX> importance.
          All MAGE software is open source, available under the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>) license which
          allows unrestricted use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-STK</ENAMEX> for any purpose,
          academic or commercial. All MAGE software and
          documentation can be found at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Future of MAGE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> has been designed to be flexible so that it
          can be used in a wide variety of technical settings
          (spotted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color cDNA arrays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> arrays, and so
          on). These extend well beyond gene-expression
          experiments, for without modification, data from all DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments and technologies that we know of
          can be stored. Examples of some of the uses and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> supported include: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color
          spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">arrays</ENAMEX> (cDNAs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products, or oligonucleotides)
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> or nylon, 
          in situ synthesized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> (Affymetrix/photolithography, ink-jet),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA abundance</ENAMEX> (gene expression, polysome profiling), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA abundance</ENAMEX> (array-CGH, chromatin immunoprecipitation,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX>). We believe that with, at most, modest
          changes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> can support experiments that use arrays
          made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, cells, or tissues.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the main weaknesses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-OM</ENAMEX> is the limited
          support it provides for data analysis. Our goal is to
          enhance the current capabilities in the next version
          substantially by providing explicit support for different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> and analysis methods. Another development
          initiative is to support conclusions based on the
          microarray data, for example the ability to indicate
          sequence motifs or biological effects (such as mortality)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with individual (or sets of) nodes in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> will adapt to the changes that occur because
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> are actively committed to maintaining
          useful standards. We appreciate all comments about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> has a moderated mailing list at
          mged-mage@lists.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sourceforge</ENAMEX>.net, which is available as a
          mechanism for announcements, instructive material, and
          general discussion.
        
        
          Interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX> with other projects
          The success of this project largely depends on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, availability, and use of ontological terms
          not defined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE</ENAMEX> project. We expect some of these
          to be designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX> (those covering the general
          properties of microarrays, and biological sciences) but
          some will certainly be developed outside the MGED
          umbrella. We are actively interested in this problem and
          look forward to interacting with these development
          efforts. For information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ontologies</ENAMEX> please
          see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the prime motivations for developing MAGE-ML
          was to encourage the analysis of
          microarray/gene-expression data by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> other than
          the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> key step in this process
          is the development of databases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private) to
          warehouse the experimental results. Such databases will
          then allow MIAME-compliant data to be retrieved as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAGE-ML</ENAMEX> documents. Many of us are actively involved in
          developing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ArrayExpress</ENAMEX> - a repository of gene-expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> hosted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBI</ENAMEX>, while others represent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> developing laboratory or institutional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix, Iobion</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosetta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania, GeneX</ENAMEX>). We believe that the efforts
          presented here will also allow software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> to
          streamline the analysis of gene-expression data, thus
          removing the current communication impasse that is so
          common.
