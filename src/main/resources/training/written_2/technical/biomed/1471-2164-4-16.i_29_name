        Draft sequences of human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly, and nematode
        genomes have recently been released, and the sequencing of
        several other complex genomes is underway. The next
        challenge - sequence completion and verification - requires
        the closing of the gaps between contigs, isolation and
        characterization of centromeric and telomeric regions that
        are poorly represented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, and verification of
        contig <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. These goals could be greatly simplified by
        a cloning strategy that would allow selective isolation of
        any genomic region. Driven by the needs of functional
        genomics, a novel approach for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cloning by homologous
        recombination in 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> has been recently
        developed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . While the new approach greatly simplify
        cloning protocols, peculiarities of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> transformation do not allow
        to apply recombinogenic engineering to large size of DNA
        fragments.
        We developed an alternative cloning procedure based on
        transformation-associated recombination (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX>) in the yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> allows to selectively isolate genomic fragments
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 300</NUMEX> kb. The following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> general TAR cloning
        approaches were developed and exploited [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . (i) When
        DNA sequence information is available from both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' flanking regions of the gene of interest, the gene is
        isolated using a vector with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> short unique sequences
        that flank the gene. The hooks can be as small as 60 bp [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        ] . (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) When DNA sequence information is available only as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' flanking regions, a modified version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX>
        cloning, called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">radial TAR cloning</ENAMEX>, is used. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">radial TAR</ENAMEX>
        cloning, one hook is a unique sequence from the chromosomal
        region of interest and the other is a repeated sequence
        that occurs frequently and randomly throughout the genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> repeats in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and 
        B1 repeats in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>). The radial
        cloning method involves isolation of a set of nested
        overlapping fragments that extend from the gene-specific
        targeting hook to upstream or downstream 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> (or 
        B1 ) positions in the gene of
        interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> has been used successfully to isolate
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a dozen single</NUMEX> copy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> genomes
        [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX>, unpublished data].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> requires that the cloned DNA fragment carry
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> autonomously replicating sequence ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> ) that can function as the origin
        of replication in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Sequences that function as 
        ARS s in yeast occur on average every
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 to 40</NUMEX> kb in all the eukaryotic genomes thus far examined
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] , which suggests that most mammalian chromosomal
        regions can be readily isolated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX>-cloning with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> that lacks an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> . The 
        ARS frequency in chromosomal regions
        that consist of multiple repetitive elements, however, such
        as the centromere and telomere, may be reduced, meaning
        that these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> may not be isolatable by the original
        TAR method.
        This report describes a general TAR cloning system for
        isolation of genomic regions regardless of the presence of 
        ARS elements. In this new system, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> contains an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> and a counter-selectable marker.
        Negative genetic selection eliminates the background due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> recircularization caused by end-joining during yeast
        transformation. This novel method provides a powerful tool
        for structural and functional analysis of eukaryotic and
        prokaryotic genomes.
      
      
        Results
        
          Vectors with a counter-selectable marker at the end
          of a targeting hook are not efficient for gene isolation
          from complex genomes
          Isolation of 
          ARS -less genomic regions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX> requires incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> origin of
          replication into the vector. It is well documented,
          however, that linearized 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS/CEN</ENAMEX> vectors circularize with
          high efficiency via illegitimate end-joining during yeast
          transformation [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and references therein]. To
          eliminate background resulting from re-circularization of
          the vector during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX>, we investigated two
          different strategies based on use of a counter-selectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strategy exploited a vector with a
          counter-selectable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker</ENAMEX> placed at the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
          targeting hooks. This strategy is similar to one widely
          used for gene disruption in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and was recently
          successful in isolating chromosomal fragments from a
          prokaryotic genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . To apply the strategy, we
          constructed a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> which, when linearized, had the
          structure 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA3-Hook1-CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3-Hook2</ENAMEX> .
          Hook1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hook2</ENAMEX> represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> targeting sequences, while 
          URA3 is a marker that can be
          selected for or against in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Circularization of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> does not prevent 
          URA3 expression and, therefore, the
          clones containing the vector without the DNA insert can
          not grow on media containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> vector
          recombines with a genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragment</ENAMEX>, the 
          URA3 gene is lost and the resulting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> clone becomes resistant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA.
          We used the selection system described above to
          isolate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> from the mouse genome. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> carries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 40</NUMEX> copies of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> integrated into a unique site on chromosome
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and references therein]. Each copy includes
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-Ha-</ENAMEX>ras gene and a simian virus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SV40</NUMEX>) polyadenylation signal and is under control of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zeta</ENAMEX>-globin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> used in this
          experiment, pARS-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SV211</NUMEX>-URA, contained a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">211-bp</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX>-specific hook and a 
          B1 repeat as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hook (see
          Methods). The vector was linearized between the 
          B1 targeting hook and 
          URA3 and co-transformed with
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast spheroplasts</ENAMEX>. Transformants were
          selected on histidine-minus synthetic medium containing
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-FOA</TIMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-positive clones were found among the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transformants</ENAMEX> analyzed. Because the standard TAR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloning</ENAMEX> technique (i.e., one that uses a vector lacking 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> and a counterselectable marker)
          yields <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%-2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-positive transformants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] , this result demonstrates that the specific
          targeting hook recombines much less efficiently when it
          is protected by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~ 1.1</NUMEX> kb nonhomologous 
          URA3 sequence. To study in greater
          detail how the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonhomologous DNA</ENAMEX> at the end
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the hooks reduces gene capture efficiency, we
          constructed a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vectors</ENAMEX> with different lengths
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonhomologous DNA</ENAMEX> next to the hook. Each vector
          contained a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bp transgene</ENAMEX>-specific hook and a common 
          B1 repeat as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hook.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1summarizes</NUMEX> the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">radial TAR cloning</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> with those vectors. As can be seen, the
          yield of gene-positive clones progressively declined as
          the length of the nonhomologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> increased. Even <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37 bp</TIMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonhomologous DNA decreased TAR cloning</ENAMEX> efficiency ~ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          times. These results demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> vectors
          with a counter-selectable marker at the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hooks</ENAMEX> are inefficient for cloning the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from complex
          mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genomes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Rationale for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> of genomic regions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lacking ARS</ENAMEX> sequences
          To reduce the background caused by recircularization
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> -containing vectors, we
          developed a different gene capture strategy (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          As in the first approach, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> vector contained a
          yeast centromere ( 
          CEN6 ), a yeast 
          ARS element ( 
          ARSH4 ), a positive-selectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> ( 
          HIS3 ), and a negative-selectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> ( 
          URA3 ). In this approach, however,
          the targeting hooks are placed between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and
          the open reading frame of the 
          URA3 gene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> derived
          from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> ADH1 gene exhibits
          specific spacing requirements for its function such that
          the permissive distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX> element and the
          transcription initiation site is at most 130 bp [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ]
          . A greater distance results in transcription initiation
          at an alternative site and inactivation of 
          URA3 expression. The specific
          spacing requirements allow selection against the
          recircularized vector. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the outcomes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          different events involving such a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX>. In Figure
          2A, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector recombines</ENAMEX> with a genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment
          via the targeting hooks, which results in separation of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> from the transcription initiation site in
          the 
          URA3 gene by the DNA insert. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resulting YAC</ENAMEX> does not express 
          URA3 and, therefore, the clone can
          be selected by medium containg <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Bshows</NUMEX> the
          results of nonhomologous end-joining leading to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-circularization of the vector. In this case, the
          distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX> element and the transcription
          initiation site is not changed, and 
          URA3 is expressed normally,
          rendering the clone sensitive to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA.
        
        
          Isolation of specific chromosomal regions with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARS</ENAMEX> and a counter-selectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning strategy described above to
          isolate the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-Ha-ras Tg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> region
          from mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The vector pARS-TGAC contained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 bp</NUMEX> of
          SV40 as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-specific targeting hook and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 bp</NUMEX> of
          a common mouse repeat 
          B1 as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hook. Both selected
          targeting sequences do not contain an ATG initiation
          codon that is out-of-frame with the vector 
          URA3 , which avoids the
          translational incompetence of 
          URA3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and resistance to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA
          (see Methods). The targeting hooks were placed in the
          promoter region of 
          URA3 as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linearized TAR cloning vector</ENAMEX> were combined
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast spheroplasts</ENAMEX> and the His +<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ura</ENAMEX> -transformants
          were selected on medium containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA to identify
          clones with genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> inserts. Yield of the
          transformants varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 colonies/ug vector,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ug genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 8spheroplasts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> clones were identified among
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">950</NUMEX> His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">+5-FOA</NUMEX>-resistant transformants screened by PCR
          for the presence of the zeta-globin promoter sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> clones characterized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHEF</ENAMEX>
          electrophoresis, size of inserts varied from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 to 200</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> the same yield of gene-positive clones
          had been previously observed during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> of this
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> with vectors lacking 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> and a counter-selectable marker
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 15</ENAMEX> ] . No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-positive clones were found when
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA selection was omitted (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>), indicating that
          the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning method is highly selective and
          efficient for isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multicopy genes</ENAMEX>.
          We also tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> with an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> -containing vector and negative
          selection can be used to isolate a single copy gene from
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> genome, such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX> from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. We
          designed a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning vector pARS</ENAMEX>-HPRT carrying a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>-bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' 
          HPRT -specific targeting hook and a
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-bp 3</NUMEX>' 
          HPRT -specific hook and inserted
          them into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region of 
          URA3 (see Methods). His +Ura
          -transformants were selected on medium containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA
          to identify recombinant clones. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transformant</ENAMEX> yields
          ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 70</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). A low yield is
          predicted for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unique
          targeting hooks. We screened 625 randomly picked
          transformants by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for the presence of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (~ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>) of them
          carried all the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX> exon sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-positive clones contained circular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YACs</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~ 40</NUMEX> kb
          DNA inserts (data not shown). Such a high yield of 
          HPRT -positive clones has been
          previously observed with a similar vector lacking the 
          ARS element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Our results
          indicate that the novel TAR cloning system is highly
          efficient, highly selective, and sufficiently sensitive
          to isolate a single copy gene from the large and complex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Selective isolation of centromeric regions
          The new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning system is useful for isolation of
          heterochromatic regions enriched by repeats and
          presumably poor in 
          ARS elements, such as a mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centromere</ENAMEX>. Human centromeres contain primarily alpha (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alphoid</ENAMEX>) satellite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">171-bp</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repeating units</ENAMEX> organized into higher order repeats. The
          length of centromeric alphoid arrays of different human
          chromosomes varies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2 to 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>.
          To apply the new selection strategy for isolation of
          large blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alphoid DNA</ENAMEX>, we created a TAR vector
          pARS-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ALF</ENAMEX> with the structure 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT-pADH1-CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3-URA3-SAT</ENAMEX> , where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 40</NUMEX>-bp fragments
          from the alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> consensus sequence (see Methods). As
          in the constructs described above, the targeting hooks
          were inserted into the 
          URA3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning
          of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">centromeric DNA</ENAMEX> was carried out as described
          above. The average yield of His +<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ura</ENAMEX> -transformants was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>. To detect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> with alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> inserts,
          randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transformants</ENAMEX> were tested by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dot</ENAMEX>-hybridization with an alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-specific probe. The
          probe has no homology to the targeting sequences in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> (see Methods). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the clones
          reacted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>, indicating high selectivity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX> alphoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-positive clones were further characterized. The size
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> inserts was determined by clamped homogeneous
          electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> gel electrophoresis and visualized with
          an alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> probe. The size of the YACs varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">210 kb</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Some isolates had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">band</ENAMEX>, suggesting that some satellite sequences may be
          unstable in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX>, as has been previously reported
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Alternatively, the transformants may have
          acquired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX>. The relatively large sizes of
          the inserts suggest that genomic alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments
          recombine with targeting hooks in the vector by sequences
          located at DNA fragment ends, rather than by internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
          Because the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> contains approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alphoid DNA monomer</ENAMEX>, it is possible
          that alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> could be cloned into an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> -containing vector even without
          counter-selection. To test this conjecture, we performed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> as above but selected His +, rather than the
          His +<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ura -</ENAMEX>, transformants. As expected, the number of
          transformants was roughly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> order of magnitude higher
          than that obtained with counter-selection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dot</ENAMEX>-hybridization of transformants showed that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 3%</NUMEX> of the clones were alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-positive.
          Thus, although alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> arrays represent a significant
          fraction of the genome, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> is
          inefficient without counter-selection. Similar results
          were obtained during cloning of genomic fragments using
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Alu -containing vector pARS</ENAMEX>-Alu90
          (data not shown).
          In conclusion, the results demonstrate that our novel
          selection system is useful for isolation of large
          centromeric <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that are poorly clonable in bacterial
          artificial chromosome vectors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furter-Graves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        demonstrated that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> ADH1 gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerant</ENAMEX> to insertion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 125</TIMEX> base pairs between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> and the transcription start site. That observation
        led to the development of a system for investigating the
        expansion of trinucleotide repeats in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> in which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX> is combined with the 
        URA3 gene, a widely used
        counter-selectable marker [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 23</NUMEX> ] . In our work, we took
        advantage of the specific spacing requirements of the 
        ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> to develop a novel TAR
        cloning procedure that allows isolation of genomic regions
        that lack 
        ARS elements. A prerequisite for
        development of the system was an estimate of the minimal
        size of targeting hooks required for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX>. That size
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> bp for each hook) exactly matches the maximal size of
        an insert tolerated with the 
        ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. The use of the system
        allowed us to include a yeast origin of replication into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> and to select <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning events against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> recircularization.
        The new system greatly expands the applicability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX>. It eliminates the limitation of the previously
        described <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> protocols by eliminating the need for
        an 
        ARS sequence in the region to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX>. Now, any region of a complex genome can be
        selectively isolated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> produces
        multiple gene isolates, it allows the isolation of both
        parental alleles of the gene which can then be used for
        haplotype analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Recently we found that up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> DNA divergence does not preclude efficient gene
        isolation by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Such tolerance to DNA divergence
        allows the isolation of highly polymorphic alleles and gene
        and homologues with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> provides an alternative approach to selectively
        clone large fragments of bacterial genomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] that are
        poor in sequences that can function as 
        ARS s in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        The new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning system has several potential
        applications for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX>. The goal of the
        current phase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX> is to close gaps and improve
        the quality of the data, which is to be accomplished by
        collecting additional sequence data. With <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX>, the
        desired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> could be isolated from the genome directly,
        rather than through construction and screening of new
        bacterial artificial chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Recently we
        successfully applied this approach to close the gaps in the
        draft of human genome sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Characterization of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR isolates</ENAMEX> has shown that the gap sequences to be
        toxic to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , which may explain why those
        regions were not found in bacterial artificial chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>. Verification of contig <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> includes
        characterization of multiple, independently isolated
        chromosome-specific clones. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> may be the simplest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to achieve that goal. We previously demonstrated that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alu -containing TAR cloning</ENAMEX> vectors
        that lack 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are efficient for
        selective isolation of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from human-rodent
        monochromosomal hybrid cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Our new
        counter-selectable system allows construction of
        representative chromosome-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> for chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> has been constructed in our
        laboratory and is now being used to improve the accuracy of
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> draft sequences.
        Among the other advantages of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning system
        is its ability to isolate centromeric and telomeric
        regions, which have been generally excluded as potential
        targets by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX> because of the
        difficulty of cloning large blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repetitive DNA</ENAMEX>. When
        centromeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is digested by a restriction endonuclease,
        the resulting fragments are usually either too small or too
        large for efficient cloning in bacterial artificial
        chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In recent work we reported isolation
        of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">centromeric DNA</ENAMEX> using a TAR vector lacking 
        ARS element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . While the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolation</ENAMEX> was selective, a standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX> technique
        does not allow to recover a significant fraction of alphoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA arrays</ENAMEX> that does not contain 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARS</ENAMEX> . In our present study, using the
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning strategy clones of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alphoid DNA</ENAMEX> up to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">~ 210</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kb</ENAMEX> in length were isolated with high selectivity.
        Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX> clones contained exclusively alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
        which in some cases was organized in higher-order repeat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 15%</NUMEX> of the isolates
        contained alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> arrays interrupted with nonalphoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> and 
        LINE repeats. Those clones can be
        used as starting material for construction of physical maps
        of human centromeres as well as for functional analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centromeres</ENAMEX>.

          The highly transformable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VL6-48N</ENAMEX> (

          HIS3 and 
          URA3 deletions, was used for
          transformation. The strain is a derivative of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VL6-48</ENAMEX> with
          the 
          ura3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> gene replaced by the

          Spheroplasts were generated as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          ] . Agarose plugs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 ul</NUMEX>) containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> ug
          of high molecular weight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were prepared from normal
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts MRC-5</ENAMEX> (ATCC) or from liver cells of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Linearized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning vector</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 ug</NUMEX>)
          was added to the plugs, treated with agarase, and mixed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast spheroplasts</ENAMEX>. Optimum conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX>
          cloning have been recently described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          Transformants were selected on synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">histidine</ENAMEX>-minus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plates</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fluoroorotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-FOA</ENAMEX>) to select
          clones that no longer express 
          URA3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Because of its toxic
          effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast spheroplasts</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA was not included in
          the top agar.
        
        
          Construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> vectors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning vectors</ENAMEX> used in this
          study. All those vectors were created with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bluescript</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> shuttle vector pRS313 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIS3-CEN6-ARSH4</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The
          cassette containing the 
          URA3 gene driven by the 
          Shizosaccharomyces pombe
          ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was derived from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pBL94</TIMEX> plasmid [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          ] . In the original cassette, the 
          ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and 
          URA3 were separated by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>-bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adaptor</ENAMEX> containing an out-of-frame ATG initiation codon.
          In our construct, we deleted this adaptor to prevent use
          of the start codon for translation; that would result in
          nonexpression of the functional 
          URA3 gene and, therefore, an
          inability to grow in the absence of uracil. The deletion
          of the adaptor also provided an opportunity to
          incorporate longer DNA fragments between the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> and
          the transcription initiation site without inactivation of
          
          URA3 . Construction of the modified
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADH1-URA3</ENAMEX> cassette included PCR
          amplification of the 
          ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and the 
          URA3 gene from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pBL94</TIMEX> plasmid
          using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of primers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADH-F plus</ENAMEX> ADH-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">URA-ARS-F plus URA-ARS</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The first pair
          amplifies the 
          ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> as an 
          Apa I- 
          Xho I fragment; the second
          amplifies the 
          URA3 gene as a 
          Cla I- 
          Bam HI fragment. The PCR fragments
          were inserted into a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pRS313</NUMEX> polylinker [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] to generate
          the basic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARS -containing TAR</ENAMEX> vector
          designated as pARS-VN. In this vector, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TATA box</ENAMEX> and
          the initiation transcription site in 
          URA3 are separated by 
          Xho I- 
          Cla I sites, which were used to
          clone targeting hooks.
          To determine the distance permitted between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX> and the transcription initiation site in pARS-VN, we
          cloned different sized 
          Alu targeting hooks (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">45/45 bp</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45/65 bp, 45/75 bp, 65/65 bp, 75/75 bp</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">115/75 bp</ENAMEX>)
          into vector 
          Xho I- 
          Cla I sites. The 
          Alu hooks were PCR-amplified from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">290-bp</ENAMEX> 
          Alu consensus sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] with
          pairs of alu-F, alu-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> primers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Each pair of 
          Alu targeting hooks is separated by
          a 
          Sma I site present in the 
          Alu consensus sequence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>

          URA3 expression after
          transformation into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VL6-48N</TIMEX>. Expression of 
          URA3 (determined by the sensitivity

          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>-bp 
          Alu inserts. Based on those
          results, we concluded that targeting sequences (hooks)
          with a combined length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 130</NUMEX> bp cloned into the 
          ADH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region would allow
          selection for insertion events during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX>.
          We designed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pairs of targeting hooks to
          investigate the selectivity of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR</ENAMEX> cloning
          system. The first pair contained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 bp</NUMEX> of the
          SV40-specific targeting sequence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 11</NUMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 bp</NUMEX> of the mouse 
          B1 element. The hooks were
          PCR-amplified from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SV800</TIMEX> vector using specific primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pairs SV-ARS-F</ENAMEX> and SV-ARS-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and cloned into 
          Xho I- 
          Cla I sites of pARS-VN, yielding
          the vector pARS-TGAC. We mutated an out-of-frame ATG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> identified in a 
          B1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">template</ENAMEX> sequence during PCR
          amplification of the hook to avoid translational
          incompetence and resistance to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-FOA. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> pair
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>-bp and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-bp specific sequences from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of human 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX> . The hooks were amplified
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPRT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> artificial chromosome
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">primer</NUMEX> pairs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HP-ARS-F and HP-ARS-</ENAMEX>R
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and cloned into the 
          Xho I- 
          Cla I sites of pARS-NK, yielding
          the vector pARS-HPRT. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> vector, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pARS-ALF</ENAMEX>, was
          designed for cloning human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alphoid DNA arrays</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pARS-ALF</ENAMEX>
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 40</NUMEX>-bp fragments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alphoid DNA monomer</ENAMEX> that
          were PCR-amplified using the primer pair <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALF-F</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALF-R</ENAMEX>
          from a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">171-bp</NUMEX> alphoid consensus sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">X07685</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
          . None of the amplified targeting hooks contained an ATG
          codon that was out-of-frame in 
          URA3 . Vectors pARS-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGAC</ENAMEX> and
          pARS-HPRT were linearized by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sal I, pARS-Alu</ENAMEX> by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sma I, and pARS-ALF</ENAMEX> by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mlu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, exposing the targeting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector pARS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SV211</NUMEX>-URA was constructed
          by insertion of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> URA3 gene between the
          targeting hooks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVC-SV211</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and cloning of 
          ARSH4 into the polylinker. 
          URA3 was amplified as a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~ 1.1</NUMEX> kb
          fragment from pRS306 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Before <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR cloning</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> was linearized with 
          Bam <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> to expose the 
          B1 targeting sequence and the 
          URA3 sequence placed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>-specific hook.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vectors</ENAMEX> used in this study did not contain 
          ARS elements. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of them,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVC-SV211</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVC-SV60</ENAMEX>, contain a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX>-bp mouse 
          B1 element as a common hook and,
          respectively, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">211 bp and 60 bp</NUMEX> of the trangene-specific
          targeting hooks. These vectors have been described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
          . We constructed an additional vector to investigate how
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonhomologous DNA</ENAMEX> at the end of a hook
          affects the efficiency of gene capture. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVC-SV60-</ENAMEX>polylinker plasmid contains the same hooks as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pVC-SV60</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , but the hooks are separated by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70 bp</NUMEX> in the pBluscript polylinker. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configuration</ENAMEX> allowed us to linearize the vector by a
          different combination of enzymes, producing a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAR</ENAMEX>
          constructs with different lengths of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonhomologous DNA</ENAMEX> at
          the end of the specific hook (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Detection of positive clones among yeast
          transformants
          We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of primers to identify transformants
          containing a human 
          HPRT sequence. IN1R plus IN1L amply
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">516</NUMEX>-bp sequence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">intron 1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">46L plus 47R</ENAMEX> amplify a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">575</NUMEX>-bp sequence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 2</TIMEX>, along with flanking introns [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . We used a pair of primers specific to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zeta</ENAMEX>-globin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region to screen PCR transformants
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene sequence</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . These primers
          generate a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">419-bp PCR</ENAMEX> product that is diagnostic for
          recombination between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR vector</ENAMEX> and genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene sequences</ENAMEX>. Yeast genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transformants</ENAMEX> and PCR-amplified as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] .
          Detection of recombinant clones obtained during TAR
          cloning with 
          Alu - and alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-containing
          vectors was carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> hybridization. For this
          purpose, we designed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> specific probes - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a 56</NUMEX>-bp
          alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragment</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sat -</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">124-bp</ENAMEX> 
          Alu fragment ( 
          Alu -<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>). Because those
          sequences are not present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TAR constructs</ENAMEX>, they are
          diagnostic for recombinant clones. The probes were
          labeled for hybridization by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> and alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> monomers as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">templates</ENAMEX> and repeat-specific primers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> clones
          Chromosome-size <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from yeast
          transformants carrying circular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YACs</ENAMEX>, separated by
          clamped homogeneous electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> gel electrophoresis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHEF</ENAMEX>), transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized
          with an alphoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> probe or 
          Alu -<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (see above). The size of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circular YACs</ENAMEX> was estimated by melting the agarose plugs
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genomic DNA</ENAMEX> prior to CHEF analysis. This
          treatment linearized <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YACs</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-400</ENAMEX> kb size range. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> DNA
          was performed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX> labeled probes and the protocol
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
