        The genome of 
        Drosophila melanogaster was sequenced
        using a whole-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> (WGS) approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> assembly (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">WGS1</NUMEX>) used only plasmid and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> paired-end
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> added <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX>-based finished and
        draft sequences (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> of [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] for details); these
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> assemblies were compared in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The joint assembly
        was submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 1</ENAMEX>. This sequence
        contained many gaps and regions of low sequence quality. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> release, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, corrected some errors in the
        order and orientation of small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and filled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> very small sequence gaps. Using
        improved WGS sequence-assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
        assemblies of just the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> plasmid and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> paired end
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS1</TIMEX> were generated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">WGS2</NUMEX>)
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2002</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">WGS3</NUMEX>), roughly coinciding with the WGS
        assemblies of the human [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>],
        respectively.
        This paper describes the finishing work we have done to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">improve Release 2</ENAMEX> in order to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
        sequence of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster euchromatin. The
        status of the heterochromatic regions of the genome is
        reported in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Our goals in generating the euchromatic
        portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> were to close all the gaps, improve
        regions of low sequence quality, extend the sequence at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeric</ENAMEX> and centromeric ends of each chromosome, and
        verify the whole genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic
        genome sequence has been reannotated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>] using a new
        annotation tool, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Companion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 9</ENAMEX>] address the complete reannotation
        of the 
        Drosophila euchromatic genome on the
        basis of improved genomic sequence and new expressed
        sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) and cDNA sequences. The improvements
        made to the genomic sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> had a large
        impact on the annotation of transposable elements [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]
        because of the substantial corrections made in the assembly
        of repeated sequences. Because the non-repetitive regions
        of the genome were generally of good quality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>,
        most of the improvements to the annotation of these regions
        resulted from the increased amounts of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> and cDNA data [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> provides a euchromatic sequence that is
        virtually gap free and of high accuracy. We were thus able
        to rigorously assess the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, as well as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> generated by each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> WGS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assemblies</ENAMEX>, by simply comparing these sequences to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic sequence and assuming that all the
        differences were the result of errors or omissions in the
        other sequence.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Overview of the finishing strategy
          Both of the sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> that participated in
          the finishing effort, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence Berkeley National</ENAMEX>
          Laboratory (LBNL) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Sequencing Center</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baylor College of Medicine</ENAMEX> (HGSC), have extensive
          experience in finishing the sequence of individual BAC
          clones. To take advantage of this expertise, we reduced
          the problem of finishing a WGS sequence to one of
          finishing a set of overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones. This approach
          allowed us to use the sequence assembly software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phrap</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>], which provided an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of the raw
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace</ENAMEX> data and an estimated error rate. Thus, apart from
          filling gaps and improving sequence quality, we were able
          to compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent assemblies of the same trace
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX> took responsibility for chromosome arms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX>,
          2R, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3R</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> and the proximal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80.6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX> chromosome arm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3L</ENAMEX> and the distal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">36.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>).
          We previously generated a physical map of the major
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autosomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based maps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]
          and chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] were also available (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We
          selected a tiling path of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones spanning the
          physical maps and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence using the available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence-tagged</ENAMEX> site (STS) maps and BAC end sequences.
          The WGS sequence traces and end sequences of the tiling
          path <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> were assigned coordinates based on their order
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> assembly. We then binned all the traces
          belonging within a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> and extending <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 bp</ENAMEX>
          beyond the end sequence of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>. These traces were
          combined with sequence traces (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> × sequence coverage)
          that had been generated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from the
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tiling</ENAMEX>-path <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and assembled using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phrap</ENAMEX>. These assemblies formed the starting point for our
          finishing efforts.
          To generate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, we closed gaps by sequencing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">518 3</NUMEX>-kb subclones, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">565 10</NUMEX>-kb clones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX> fragments
          generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>; we improved quality with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,344</NUMEX> custom
          primer sequence runs. To assess the accuracy of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual BAC</ENAMEX> assemblies, we compared 
          in silico restriction maps
          generated from the sequence of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> to restriction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fingerprints</ENAMEX> essentially as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. A set of 
          Bam <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hind III</ENAMEX> digests was used to verify
          the assembly of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">618</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">328</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> enzyme digests were available to verify the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>. The finished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone sequences were submitted
          individually to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>.
          The assembly of the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> into entire
          chromosome arms was verified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. First, BAC
          tiling path clones were mapped by 
          in situ hybridization to the
          polytene salivary gland chromosomes of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> instar
          larvae, which serves as an unambiguously correct physical
          map. 
          In situ hybridization data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">547</NUMEX>
          clones in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> tiling path have been reported
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Images documenting the localization of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">915</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> in the tiling path can be found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GadFly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome Annotation Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
          unique end sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,424</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> were aligned to the
          assembled chromosome arm sequences. If the fully
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced BACs</ENAMEX> were not assembled in the correct order
          and orientation, we would expect to find regions of the
          genome where those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">end sequences</ENAMEX> fail to align to
          positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 100</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 kb</NUMEX> apart; such regions of
          misaligned paired BAC end sequence were not observed in
          the final <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> chromosome arm assemblies. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">chromosome arms</ENAMEX> are composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX> and contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> sequence gaps. A sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX> is defined as a set of contiguous sequence
          contigs, ordered and oriented with respect to one
          another; within a scaffold, the gaps between adjacent
          contigs are of known size and are spanned by clones [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
          Physical map gaps are gaps between scaffolds; in these
          cases, no clones that span the gap have been
          identified.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refinements</ENAMEX> to the physical map
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based physical map of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome was
          constructed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Drosophila Genome Project</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDGP</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and used as a starting point for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based
          sequence assembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> In our finishing work, we
          replaced mismapped BACs at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13A and 14D</TIMEX>. We also filled
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> clone gaps in the physical map, identifying BACs
          that span them by comparing the paired end sequences of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,869</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome is in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> scaffolds of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.8</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.4 Mb</ENAMEX>, and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> physical map gaps at
          9EF and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20A</ENAMEX>, estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> kb and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> kb in size,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Several short tandem arrays lie
          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 kb</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9EF</TIMEX> gap, but it possesses no other
          remarkable sequence features. Complex nests of
          transposable elements flank the gap at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20A</TIMEX>, which lies
          within the centric heterochromatin; such nests of
          transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are common in the proximal regions
          of the chromosome arms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          Our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based physical map of the autosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] was
          used as a starting point for sequence assembly of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chromosome. The left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2L</NUMEX>) is
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scaffolds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.7</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.8 Mb</ENAMEX> and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clone gap
          at 39D<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-E</ENAMEX> that contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-200</NUMEX> tandem repeats of the
          histone gene cluster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Each repeat contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five</NUMEX>
          histone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">His1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">His3</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H4</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">His4</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H2A</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">His2A</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H2B</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">His2B</NUMEX>) . Two
          predominant forms of the repeat, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> kb, have
          been previously described and differ primarily in the
          size of the spacer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> between 
          His1 and 
          His3 . The variants are not
          interspersed with one another; but form segregated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> at the distal side of the gap has at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> copies of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-kb variant and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> side of the gap has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> copies of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX>-kb variant.
          The right arm of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2R</NUMEX>) is in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          scaffolds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb and 4.5 Mb</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clone
          gaps, one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42B</TIMEX> and another in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57B</TIMEX>, estimated to be 100
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> kb, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The clone gap in
          42B is associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 to 100</NUMEX> copies of a previously
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uncharacterized 596</ENAMEX> bp repeat showing weak similarity to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-directed RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>, interspersed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-kb units
          that have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> nucleotide similarity to the 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1731</TIMEX> transposable element. The
          other clone gap on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57B</TIMEX>, is flanked on the distal
          side by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120-bp</NUMEX> tandem repeats with similarity to snoRNAs
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], and on the proximal side by a different <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120-bp</ENAMEX>
          repeat.
          The left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3L</NUMEX>) is in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scaffolds
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Mb and 18.5 Mb</ENAMEX>, with a single clone gap at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>,
          estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 kb</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The right arm of
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3R</NUMEX>) has no euchromatic clone gaps and is
          represented in a single sequence contig of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>.
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based physical map of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] was
          used as a starting point for sequence assembly of this
          arm. This map has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clone gaps, one at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">102A</TIMEX> and the
          other at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">102EF</TIMEX>. The gap at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">102A</TIMEX> was estimated to be very
          small and was filled with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">46,766 bp</NUMEX> of sequence in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. The gap at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">102EF</TIMEX> was estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> kb
          and remains the only clone gap on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> exists in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two scaffolds 1.2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb and 0.03 Mb</ENAMEX>. The gene 
          CG17467 extends into the gap from
          the proximal side, and the 
          CG18026 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPS</ENAMEX>) gene extends into
          the gap from the distal side; these sequences can be used
          as starting points to fill the gap for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 4</ENAMEX> of the
          genome sequence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAPS gene</ENAMEX> is found in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>-kb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> that extends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28.5</NUMEX> kb into the gap,
          ending in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 2 kb</TIMEX> of the simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-bp repeat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CATAATAAT</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Assessment of the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          The total size of the euchromatic portion of the 
          Drosophila genome in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> is
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">116,914,271 bp</NUMEX>. The status of each chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>,
          including length, number of physical map gaps, number of
          finished and unfinished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>, number of sequence gaps,
          and sequence quality, estimated as error rate in a
          sliding window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> kb, is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The
          positions of the remaining gaps are diagrammed in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The euchromatic genome is assembled into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> contigs;
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the genome is contained in contigs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N50</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>
          or greater, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N99</NUMEX>) is in contigs greater than 526
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kb</ENAMEX>. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> physical map gaps and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gaps</ENAMEX> remain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The sequence is highly accurate:
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.7%</NUMEX> of the base pairs are contained within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-kb
          regions having estimated error rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> per
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 bp</NUMEX>. The estimated error rate was also determined
          for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">950</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> that comprise the tiling path.
          All have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phrap</ENAMEX> estimated error rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000 bp</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">875</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>) are estimated to have less than
          one error in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 bp</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Extending the sequence
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chromosome X</ENAMEX>
            The sequence at the telomere of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> is contained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BACR13J02</TIMEX>, but this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> is
            not completely assembled and does not extend to the TAS
            repeats. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
            extends proximally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX> kb beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            toward the centromere. The proximal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            are not covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones; we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb clones
            from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> in order to produce this sequence. The
            WGS3 assembly extends beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> kb, ending
            in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX> copies of the simple repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAGA</ENAMEX>, a known
            heterochromatic satellite repeat [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Chromosome 2L
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> telomeric sequence, extending
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> kb farther than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, ends
            in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> copies of the TAS repeat. The proximal sequence
            of chromosome arm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX> ends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> kb of nested
            transposable elements.
          
          
            Chromosome 2R
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> telomeric sequence ends in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies
            of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX>-bp repeat similar to the previously described
            telomeric sequence in the TAS element. The proximal
            sequence of chromosome arm 2R is highly enriched in
            transposable element sequence.
          
          
            Chromosome 3L
            There has been no change in the sequence of the 3L
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomere</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. It has a
            single copy of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">458</NUMEX>-bp sequence with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> similarity to
            the minisatellite TAS repeats of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX>. The proximal
            sequence of chromosome arm 3L extends beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> kb and is highly enriched in transposable element
            sequence.
          
          
            Chromosome 3R
            The telomere of chromosome arm 3R in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
            contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> copies of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">983</NUMEX>-bp repeat similar to the
            previously described telomeric sequence in the TAS
            element; it extends the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence by
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> kb. We did not substantially extend the
            proximal sequence of chromosome arm 3R in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">WGS3</NUMEX> assembly extends 774 bp beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> and
            ends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> tandem copies of a nearly perfect simple
            repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATAA</ENAMEX>, a known heterochromatic satellite
            repeat.
          
          
            Chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
            The most distal BAC on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BACH59K20</TIMEX>, is
            not anchored to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mb</ENAMEX> main scaffold. This BAC
            contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 32-kb</NUMEX> of sequence not mapped to
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. Analysis of the sequence of
            this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> shows that it should have been appended in
            inverted orientation, because it ends in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies of
            an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 700</NUMEX> bp portion of a 
            HeT-A element, whose poly(A) tail
            is oriented toward the centromere. The sequence of
            chromosome arm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> extends proximally to
            that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 60</NUMEX> kb. This extension
            contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four 8 kb</NUMEX> tandem imperfect repeats, each
            bounded by a 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">narep 1</ENAMEX> repeat. The distal repeat
            contains the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plexin</ENAMEX> B gene; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> proximal
            repeats contain related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding genes 
            CG32010, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG32011</ENAMEX> and 
            CG32009 .
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comparing Releases 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence of the euchromatin contained
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,107 gaps</NUMEX> of which we were aware. These 'declared' gaps
          were represented in the sequence by a string of Ns
          corresponding in length to the estimated gap size, or by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX> if we were unable to estimate the size of the
          gap. Our comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Releases 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">424</NUMEX>
          additional insertions or deletions greater than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 bp</TIMEX>,
          which we refer to as 'undeclared' sequence gaps (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Now that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 97%</NUMEX> of the gaps in the
          euchromatic sequence have been filled, we are able to
          examine the sequences that were missing in both the
          declared and undeclared gaps. The sequences missing in
          each gap were classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> categories: unique
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, transposable element, homopolymer, simple
          repeat, tandem duplications, local misassembly, or gross
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misassembly</ENAMEX>. In addition, we identified individual
          base-pair differences, as well as insertions and
          deletions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 20 bp</NUMEX>.
          In the WGS assemblies, the sequence coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosomes is expected to be less than for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autosomes</ENAMEX>. The autosomal coverage was estimated to be 12x
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]; thus, sequence coverage is expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9×</NUMEX> for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3x</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, assuming an equal
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> in the collection used
          to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX>. Presumably as a result of
          its reduced sequence coverage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> times as many gaps (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">743,</ENAMEX>
          representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> of the total) per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> as those
          of the autosomes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the gaps in the
          euchromatic portion of the genome that lie in unique
          sequence map to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome is
          almost entirely heterochromatic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome
          sequences are limited to small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
          Repetitive elements are difficult to assemble in a
          whole-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> strategy. As a consequence, one of
          the initial steps in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> assembly was to
          identify known repetitive elements, including
          transposable elements, and remove their traces from the
          early steps of the assembly process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. After the
          unique sequence was assembled and sequence contigs were
          ordered and oriented, those transposable element sequence
          traces were added back. Sequence traces belonging to
          transposable element <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were assembled using an
          aggressive strategy that resulted in composite sequences
          for most of the transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. Part
          of the finishing effort has been to determine the
          sequence of each individual element. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,572</NUMEX> full
          and partial transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380</NUMEX> are identical to the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
          transposable element sequences. Of these identical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">323</NUMEX> are shorter than 900 bp and could be
          assembled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reads if those reads contained
          sufficient unique sequence to be unambiguously placed.
          The sequences of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> transposable elements
          are identical between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> because
          their sequence was determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> Drosophila
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Project</ENAMEX> (BDGP) as part of the finishing process
          leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the
          total number of gaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">euchromatin</ENAMEX> are the
          consequence of transposable elements. A slightly higher
          fraction of the gaps are the consequence of simple
          repeats.
          Duplications in the 
          Drosophila genome are rare in
          comparison to the number found in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genomes</ENAMEX>. We
          observed tandem repeats whose repeat units range in size
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 bp to 30 kb</NUMEX>. The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> comprised of
          tandemly duplicated repeats in the euchromatic portion of
          the 
          Drosophila genome is the histone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">39B</NUMEX> described above. As a prelude to a more
          rigorous analysis of repeats, we have searched for
          perfect direct or inverted repeats <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 100 bp</NUMEX> in length
          that are not transposable elements or low-complexity
          sequence. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of repeated sequence (less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of the euchromatic genome), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> mapping to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chromosome X</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Although there are more repeats
          on chromosomes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X and 2</ENAMEX>, they appear to be randomly
          distributed and are not clustered at the centromeres or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeres</ENAMEX>. This is in contrast to the increased number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> duplications found in the pericentric regions of
          mammalian chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Misassemblies of tandem
          repeats account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> of all gaps. Local
          misassemblies resulting in small insertions, the result
          of low-quality sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, are also rare,
          constituting <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX> of the gaps.
          We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> gross misassemblies in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> resulted in large sequence insertions or
          deletions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, and one resulted in a large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inversion</ENAMEX>. In addition, a polymorphism in the isogenic
          strain resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighth</NUMEX> large-scale sequence
          difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Releases 2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. This polymorphic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> duplication consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX> kb of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> bounded by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hobo</ENAMEX> and 
          cruiser transposable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>; half
          of the BACs mapping to this location contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of
          the repeat and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. Transposable
          element sequence is associated with the ends of all of
          the misassembled regions. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome, at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">position 3.4 Mb</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> transposable element
          sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> has been replaced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> with
          a single copy of a 
          roo element and a gap. When
          complete, this region is expected to contain three 
          roo elements. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2L</TIMEX> there is one
          misassembly, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>. A declared gap estimated to be
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,400 bp</NUMEX> and involving an 
          mdg3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transposable</ENAMEX> element was
          filled in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kb of sequence. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2R</TIMEX> there
          are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> misassemblies, mapping to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20.1 Mb</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> declared gaps
          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">135 kb</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence. That sequence has
          been replaced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> kb of sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>,
          bounded by a 
          G element at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end</TIMEX> and an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">invader 3</ENAMEX> element at the other. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> misassembly is a declared gap, estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          kb, that was filled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> kb of sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>.
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> kb of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> transposable element
          sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> has been replaced with a single
          complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb 
          roo element in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3R</TIMEX>, a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6-kb</TIMEX> segment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> is replaced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> with
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">33 kb.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> contains a
          large misassembly that inverts the distal <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Locke</ENAMEX>, personal communication). The
          inversion occurred at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">751,419</NUMEX>, the location of a
          portion of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1360</TIMEX> element. The misassembled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
          sequence ends with a TAATAATA 
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">27</NUMEX>) repeat that maps starting at
          position <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">817,409 bp</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>.
          We identified single base substitutions and single
          nucleotide insertions and deletions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. Excepting transposable elements, the rate of
          base changes is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22,000 bp</NUMEX> for the autosomes and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,000 bp</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. Within
          transposable elements, the rate of base changes is one
          per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">124 bp</NUMEX>; this high error rate is largely a consequence
          of comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence of individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> to the composite sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> assemblies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          In addition to comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequence releases previously deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, we
          also compared <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> to each of three pure WGS
          assemblies. These comparisons allow an assessment of how
          well a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> approach works on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">180 Mb</ENAMEX> metazoan genome.
          Although the specific software we used is proprietary,
          the underlying algorithms and the logic have been fully
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>] and the basic approach replicated by
          others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. An analysis of these assemblies in
          light of the modifications to the algorithmic strategy
          made between assemblies should inform the development of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WGS</ENAMEX> assembly software in general. The sequence traces
          used in these assemblies are available from the GenBank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace</ENAMEX> repository and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> offers a high-quality
          sequence for comparison, providing an important resource
          for testing new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX>. The sequences
          that comprise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the WGS2 and WGS3</TIMEX> assemblies are also
          available for benchmarking.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> assemblies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> data were made, each using
          a different version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Celera Genomics</ENAMEX> assembly
          software. WGS1 used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,156,000</NUMEX> paired-end <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> reads
          from genomic plasmids and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,152</NUMEX> paired BAC-end reads. An
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62,000</NUMEX> reads that had been erroneously removed
          during the quality screening process for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS1</TIMEX> were added
          to the input data set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two</TIMEX> assemblies (WGS2
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS3</ENAMEX>). The assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> that produced WGS1 did
          not adequately handle repeat resolution; a variety of
          improvements, including a different method of placing
          repeat traces, better identification of repeat traces,
          and the introduction of a sequence correction algorithm,
          resulted in better subsequent assemblies, particularly of
          repetitive regions.
          The output of the assembly process is a collection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX> made up of ordered and oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX> linked
          together by paired end sequences. Paired-end reads of
          clones whose size falls within a tight distribution allow
          the length of every gap between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contigs of a scaffold
          to be characterized with an expected mean and standard
          deviation. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">732,000</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> produced
          from the ends of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-kb plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 548,000</NUMEX>
          pairs of sequences from the ends of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb plasmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,152</NUMEX> pairs of BAC-end sequences a mean
          distance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130 kb</NUMEX> apart from each other. Table 3presents
          statistics characterizing the scaffolds in the three
          assemblies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4presents</ENAMEX> the same statistics for the
          scaffolds that align to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The scaffolds that do not align to the
          chromosome arms, totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of sequence and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spanning 20.7 Mb</ENAMEX>, derive from the heterochromatic regions
          of the genome (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] for more information on the
          content of these scaffolds.)
          The output of the assembler contains only the sequence
          reads that assemble with high confidence into a contig.
          As a result, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-25%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> reads, most of
          which come from heterochromatin or interspersed
          repetitive elements, do not form part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>.
          Table 3provides evidence that the total amount of data
          that was reliably assembled increased as the assembly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> improved. In the later assemblies, more
          sequence from heterochromatic regions of the genome is
          reported, but in a more fractured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> than for
          euchromatic regions. These additional assembled pieces,
          although constituting a modest fraction of the sequence,
          constitute a large percentage of the number of scaffolds
          and contigs. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> largest scaffolds of the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assemblies</ENAMEX> constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 80%</NUMEX> of the sequence and are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost</NUMEX> identical.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> assemblies, a small number of large
          scaffolds cover the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">116.9 Mb</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). WGS3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffolds</ENAMEX> span <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.91%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> euchromatic sequence and extend beyond it by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>.
          Mean gap length increased between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS2 and WGS3</TIMEX>, but
          there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as many gaps, indicating that WGS3
          resolved many of the smaller interspersed repeats.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scaffold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N50</ENAMEX> lengths are similar in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), as all of the mapped scaffolds are large. Of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">116.9 Mb of Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic sequence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS1</TIMEX> provided
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.6%</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS2</TIMEX> provided <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.4%</NUMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> provided <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.9%</NUMEX> of
          the sequence.
          The content of sequence gaps in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS2</ENAMEX> and WGS3
          was determined by comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. The majority
          of this sequence - <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>, respectively - is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repetitive</ENAMEX>, either tandem repeats or transposable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>.
          We compared the order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> euchromatic
          sequences with the order of the contigs and scaffolds in
          each of the WGS assemblies (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
          Assuming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> is correct, we manually examined
          and categorized these discrepancies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5shows</ENAMEX> the
          number of incorrectly ordered segments in each category
          and the total number of base pairs involved in those
          segments. Occasionally, what look like separate scaffolds
          actually overlap; a contig at the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> scaffold
          contains sequence that belongs in a gap at the end of the
          other scaffold. These interleaved scaffolds induce a
          subtype of local order error, as seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. In
          later versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, the number of
          interleaving failures actually increased. Until now, all
          the algorithmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> have simply considered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX> to be non-overlapping, and have ignored this
          phenomenon. The order and orientation of the scaffolds
          themselves is correct, so these are considered separately
          from local errors.
          We measured the base-pair accuracy of the sequence in
          the WGS assemblies. We found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,722</NUMEX> discrepancies in
          WGS1, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,355</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,095</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> corresponding to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.99</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.20</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.09 errors per 10,000 bp</NUMEX>, respectively.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Human Genome Research Institute</ENAMEX> (NHGRI)
          standard for finished sequence is less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> error per
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 bp</NUMEX>. With the exception of gaps, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX> nearly meets
          this standard for finished sequence over the entire
          assembled sequence. However, most of the errors are in
          the reconstruction of repetitive sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>); in
          the unique sequence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> assemblies exceed the
          error rate standard.
          Furthermore, assemblies tend to be less accurate at
          the tips of contigs, because the number of reads covering
          the ends is much lower than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the contig</TIMEX>.
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, sequence quality rises when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-50</NUMEX> bp
          are eliminated from the ends of each contig. Though the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> sequences contain more gaps than would be considered
          acceptable for 'finished' sequence, the sequences that
          are present are highly accurate.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        
          Generating a finished sequence
          In producing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, we have greatly improved the
          quality of the 
          Drosophila euchromatic sequence. We
          have increased sequence accuracy and reduced the number
          of sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">contigs</ENAMEX> spanning the euchromatic portion of
          the genome from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,100 to 50</NUMEX>. The largest sequence contig
          covers the entire chromosome arm 3R in a single contig of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">27 Mb</ENAMEX>. However, more remains to be done, and we have
          already begun work on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 4</ENAMEX>. We are confident that
          all but a few of the remaining sequence gaps can be
          closed with existing technology. Likewise, we can easily
          improve the few regions of low sequence quality that
          remain. A greater challenge will be resolving complex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> duplications, and discovering and correcting the
          sequence assembly errors that they cause. We have been
          fortunate to have access to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different assemblies, one
          of the whole genome, produced with a constrained
          assembler that utilizes paired-end information, and the
          other of BAC-sized intervals produced with an
          unconstrained assembler, phrap. Comparison of the
          products of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> assemblers with low-resolution
          restriction enzyme fingerprints of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones has
          convinced us that constrained assemblies carried out on
          small genome intervals and more exact comparison to
          restriction digests are necessary to be truly confident
          of the fidelity of the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, especially in
          repetitive regions.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> sequencing is efficient
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, we delivered a sequence of the
          euchromatic 
          Drosophila genome that has proven
          extremely useful to experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, representing
          over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.7%</NUMEX> of the finished sequence. Repetitive sequences
          were of only draft quality, however. Using improved
          assembly software, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of the 
          Drosophila genome was assembled
          accurately in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WGS3</TIMEX>, judged by comparison to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, with virtually no global errors and few local
          order and orientation errors. With the exception of a
          larger number of gaps, overall sequence quality
          approaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHGRI</ENAMEX> standard for finished sequence.
          Furthermore, it is likely that continued algorithmic
          advances and specific refinements to treat the case of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> repeats will improve the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in
          repetitive regions. Initial objections to the WGS
          strategy suggested that the finishing stage would be more
          difficult and expensive than BAC-by-BAC sequencing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>],
          in particular because of a lack of clones to use as
          finishing templates. However, we found that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> used in the WGS provide an excellent resource
          for finishing. Such clones are large enough to cover most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> and small enough to sequence conveniently by
          transposon insertion methods.
        
        
          If we were to start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>?
          In the course of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Genome</ENAMEX> Project we have
          utilized a wide variety of sequencing strategies. On the
          basis of our experience, our strategy to sequence another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> would be the following. First, carry out WGS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> using paired-end reads from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb plasmids and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX>-kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7×, 5×</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX> × sequence coverage, respectively. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, align
          the BAC end sequences to the assembled sequence scaffolds
          to generate a preliminary physical map. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, generate
          high-resolution restriction enzyme fingerprints of BAC
          clones in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-deep tiling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> across each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> to
          resolve collapsed repeats and to verify the physical map
          and final assembly. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, localize a sampling of BACs
          using fluorescence 
          in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) to
          associate the sequence scaffolds to their chromosome of
          origin. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, close gaps using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb clones as
          sequencing templates. Note that we would not generate
          sequence information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>, except for their end
          sequences, choosing instead to use the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> clones
          as templates for all finishing work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixth</ENAMEX>, improve
          low-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> with custom primers.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">y 1allele</ENAMEX> as an A to C transversion
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATG</ENAMEX> translation initiation codon as first
          determined by Geyer 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. We determined the
          molecular lesion of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1allele</ENAMEX> to be a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,832 bp</NUMEX>
          deletion relative to wild type. The mutation in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bw</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1was</ENAMEX> known to be associated with
          an uncharacterized insertion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. We have identified
          the insertion to be a 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">412</NUMEX> transposable element mapping to
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> exon. The wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>, located genetically and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytologically</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, has not yet been molecularly
          characterized. However, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sp 1is</ENAMEX> known to be suppressible by 
          suppressor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sable</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], a known

            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based assembly
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC</ENAMEX>-based assemblies were produced using phred
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version 0.000925.c</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] and phrap version 0.990329 [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]. WGS traces were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera Genomics</ENAMEX> with
            a listing for each trace that included name, insert
            size and coordinates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. We determined the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> coordinates of each <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">BAC-</ENAMEX>end in our tiling
            path by comparison of the BAC-end sequences to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence. The WGS sequence traces
            corresponding to the region spanned by each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> in the
            tiling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> were then pooled with the sequence traces
            generated from that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.5×</NUMEX> coverage [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]) and assembled using phrap. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX>, draft sequence
            from neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> was also included in each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>. Traces for repeat sequences, including
            transposable elements, were obtained from Celera
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomics</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (surrogate traces) with
            multiple location coordinates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>, and another
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> k traces) with no location coordinates. Only those
            sequence traces derived from repetitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that could
            be associated with their unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> pairs were
            included in our assemblies. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">950</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone
            assemblies were generated to complete the euchromatic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> tiling path.
          
          
            Sequence gap closure
            The phrap assemblies were viewed using consed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version 10</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and more recently, version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.0</NUMEX>. At
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX>, BAC end sequences were manually tagged, and if
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> was in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> contig, gap sizes
            were estimated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consed</ENAMEX> and phrapview version
            0.960731 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. To aid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of gap
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sizes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">phrap</ENAMEX>-based assemblies were compared to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> assembly using Sim4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX>, gap sizes
            and locations were estimated, before phrap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>,
            using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> read coordinates. Gap closure status was
            monitored in the phrap assemblies using
            check-contig.pl, a program developed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX>.
            Assemblies were automatically tagged using BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]
            or cross-match [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] to identify the location of
            transposable elements.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX> used slightly different strategies
            for gap filling. With an estimated gap size, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX> used
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> gap-filling methods to determine their
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, gaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> were sequenced
            using custom primers designed by consed and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-kb</NUMEX> or
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb plasmid as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, gaps between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> kb that were spanned by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-kb</NUMEX> clone were
            completed by sequencing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kb clone using a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">transposon</ENAMEX>-based sequencing strategy, described below;
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, gaps between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> kb and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kb that were spanned
            by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-kb</NUMEX> clone were completed by sequencing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> using a transposon-mediated sequencing strategy;
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, gaps larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kb were completed by
            sequentially sequencing multiple <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-kb</NUMEX> clones to walk
            across the gap. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX>, very rarely, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was
            generated and sequenced using custom designed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX>'s initial approach to gap closure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3L</ENAMEX> was to
            design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> pairs to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> each gap. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One thousand</NUMEX>
            base-pairs of sequence flanking each gap (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> bp
            total per gap) was extracted from the published
            chromosome sequence. The flanking sequences were masked
            for repeats using Repeat-masker [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-22</NUMEX> bp
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> pairs were chosen for each gap using PRIMER
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], such that the predicted melting temperature
            was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">58 ±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3°C</ENAMEX> for gaps of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 2,000 bp</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> ±
            6°C for gaps of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 2,000 bp</NUMEX>. We successfully
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generated PCR</ENAMEX> products for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">290 gaps up to 9,000 bp</NUMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> sequencing primers were synthesized for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing PCR</ENAMEX> products <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 2,000 bp</NUMEX>. PCR
            products greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> were treated one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>. If the sequence of the product corresponded to a
            known transposon, a battery of custom-made sequencing
            primers evenly spaced across the element was used to
            generate the sequence. Alternatively, random shotgun
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> were generated and sequenced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> × coverage.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HGSC</ENAMEX> used phrap to assemble individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> and derive
            quality scores. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> containing large, nearly
            exact, duplications refractory to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> by phrap
            were resolved using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assembler</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Sequencing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-kb</NUMEX> clones
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX> sequenced <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-kb</NUMEX> clones using different
            strategies as part of the finishing process. LBNL
            employed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">γδ transposon</ENAMEX>-based strategy to sequence
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-kb</TIMEX> clones essentially as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. An 
            in vitro transposition system
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnzymes TGS</ENAMEX>) was used to sequence <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-kb</NUMEX> clones.
            Either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 or 48</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> per clone were selected for
            sequencing of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 or 10-kb</NUMEX> clones, respectively.
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-kb</NUMEX> clones at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX> were usually sequenced using
            shotgun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Libraries</ENAMEX> were prepared according to
            the double adaptor method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] with the following
            modifications: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was sheared using the Hydroshear
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Machines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Carlos</ENAMEX>, CA) at speed code <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
            cycles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">phenol</ENAMEX> extraction and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> precipitation
            after end repair and ligation steps were replaced with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen PCR</ENAMEX> Cleanup columns. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shotgun</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were constructed as the other
            libraries but without the size-selection step and with
            an increase in the shearing pressure from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 20</NUMEX> psi
            and increase in time from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 5</NUMEX> min. Some clones at
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX> were sequenced using the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">'EZ::TN</ENAMEX> <KAN-2> Tn5
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">transposon</ENAMEX>-based strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
          
          
            Quality
            BAC assemblies in a single sequence contigs were
            evaluated for base-pair accuracy using the phrap
            consensus quality scores. Regions of low quality were
            identified and sequenced using custom primers designed
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consed Autofinish</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] to bring the estimated error
            rate to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> error in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000 bp</NUMEX>. Completed
            high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> sequence was submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unfinished BACs</ENAMEX> were submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> as phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
            sequence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> duplications were resolved by adding
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phd</ENAMEX> files from subassemblies. In cases of multiple
            identical copies of repeated sequence, phd files were
            used to generate an accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, but not
            necessarily an accurate quality score, as it is
            impossible to automatically constrain the location of
            individual traces. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>
            non-redundant sequence) had no difficult repeats and
            assembled easily using phrap. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>
            of non-redundant sequence) that included a finished
            sequence of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P1</NUMEX> clone, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> was driven by the
            P1 sequence. In order for phrap to correctly assemble
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">227</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> non-redundant sequence) it was
            necessary to include phd files corresponding to either
            the sequence of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-kb</NUMEX> (totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) or a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb
            (totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) plasmid, or other phd files (totaling
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3.4 Mb</ENAMEX>) to obtain a correct assembly (see Repeat
            assembly below for more details).
          
          
            Assembly verification
            At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> assemblies were viewed using phrapview,
            which was customized to recognize our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-kb and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-kb subclones and display the paired-end
            relationships with a color-coded key. Clones that were
            beyond acceptable size or orientation parameters are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized</ENAMEX> in red as 'problem clones'. Clusters of such
            clones indicate a collapsed repeat or misassembly. At
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX>, in addition to phrapview, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> assemblies were
            verified by comparing the order of the reads in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> assembly with the order of the reads in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contigs</ENAMEX> generated using phrap and correlating the
            expected gap size with the completed sequence. This
            enabled rapid visualization of large-scale
            discrepancies, such as collapses or inversions, between
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> and the phrap assemblies. Final BAC assemblies
            were then verified by comparing the virtual restriction
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digest</ENAMEX> to 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX>, 
            Bam <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hind III</ENAMEX> fingerprints produced by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX> and manually called at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX>. Band sizes
            in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6 to 16</NUMEX> kb were used for comparison.
            At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> BAC sequence assemblies were also
            compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence from that region
            using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sim4</ENAMEX> to analyze the large-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, and
            Sim3 to identify base-pair differences.
          
          
            Repeat assembly
            At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX> we developed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> custom assembly programs,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembleSubclone</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pl</ENAMEX> and deconstruct.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pl</ENAMEX> to facilitate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> of tandem repeats. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AssembleSubclone</ENAMEX>.pl was
            used to join the two traces, generated by primers in
            opposite direction from the same transposon insertion,
            prior to phrap assembly of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3- or 10-kb plasmid</NUMEX> clones;
            this process effectively doubles the read length. A phd
            file generated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of the plasmid clone
            was used to direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deconstruct</ENAMEX>.pl was
            used to resolve collapsed repeats provided that
            sufficient variation exists in the repeat copies. Using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deconstruct</ENAMEX>.pl, we extracted local regions from the
            main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and reassembled the associated traces and
            their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> pairs at high stringency using phrap. The
            resulting consensus sequence was then incorporated in a
            reassembly of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Arm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and overlap verification
            Quality scores and consensus sequence from the BAC
            assemblies were exported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Consed</ENAMEX>. Chromosome arm
            assemblies were generated by determining the overlap
            between neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> using pslayout (LBNL) a
            program developed for this purpose as part of the human
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] or by BLAST (HGSC). Discrepancies
            in overlap regions were reviewed and resolved. The
            programs Assemble-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> (LBNL) or BACstitcher (HGSC) was
            used to generate a FASTA file of the chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>,
            starting with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> BAC in the tiling path and
            adding the unique sequence from the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining</NUMEX> BAC to
            extend the sequence contig. To assess the accuracy of
            the chromosome arm assemblies we determined the
            location and orientation of the BAC-end sequences using
            a customized version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sim4</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]; we also checked
            that each gene present in the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was appropriately located in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> using
            BLAST. To generate quality scores for an entire
            chromosome arm, we associated a phrap consensus score
            with each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>. In regions of overlap between
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neighboring BACs</ENAMEX>, the highest consensus score was used.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaps</ENAMEX> represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX> were not given a consensus
            quality score and did not contribute negatively to the
            estimated error rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence</ENAMEX> and physical map gaps
            are representing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm assembly</ENAMEX> by sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX>. One
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thousand Ns</ENAMEX> correspond to physical map gaps. If the gap
            size could be estimated, it was filled with the
            corresponding number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX>.
            At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX>, unfinished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> sequences were used to
            produce chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-11</ENAMEX>) and chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3L</NUMEX> arm
            assemblies if the unfinished portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> was
            limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> short (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-10 kb</TIMEX>) regions of the
            clone but was high quality everywhere else. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGSC</ENAMEX>,
            regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence were used to produce
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chromosome X</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-11</ENAMEX>) and chromosome 3L <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> assemblies if
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones spanning these regions had not yet been
            identified. In regions of overlap between finished
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> and either unfinished or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACstitcher</ENAMEX> preferentially incorporated finished
            sequence.
          
        
        
          Sequence comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          In order to quantify the base-pair differences between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, we aligned the sequences using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MUMmer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v 2.1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. We searched for maximal exact matches
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least 100 bp</NUMEX>. From the list of exact matches, we
          generated a path of ordered and oriented matches that
          served as landmarks for subsequent analysis. In regions
          where discrepancies were detected, we compared <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> using Sim4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] to determine
          subintervals of high similarity within the sequence and
          to count the number of individual base-pair differences
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each subinterval</TIMEX>.
          Each unmatched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was classified according to the
          nature of the mismatch as follows: known gaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
          2 which are filled with sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>; newly
          discovered gaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> defined as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 bp</TIMEX> or more of
          sequence that does not align with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> using Sim4;
          and regions containing single nucleotide differences
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>, defined as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> of sequence that does not align with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> using
          Sim4.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> sequence was used to characterize the
          content of the known and newly discovered gaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The sequence content was annotated as: transposable
          element; homopolymer; simple repeats; tandem repeats;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misassemblies</ENAMEX>; unique; gross misassemblies; and unfilled
          for those gaps that remain in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. Transposable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were identified using a curated list described
          in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homopolymers</ENAMEX> and simple repeats were determined
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repeat-Masker</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> repeats were identified using
          Sim4 and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> gap sequence and the adjacent
          neighboring sequences. If the gap filling sequence showed
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> Sim4 similarity to the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, it was
          classified as a tandem repeat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> sequence that
          does not align with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> was compared using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sim4</ENAMEX> and
          the adjacent neighboring sequence. If the unaligned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> sim4 similarity to the neighboring
          sequences, it was classified as a misassembly. Any
          interval not falling into one of these categories was
          considered unique. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> gross misassemblies are
          described in Results and discussion.
        
        
          Modifications to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> assembler
          Between each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, the assembler was revised and
          improved. The basic algorithmic strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> is to
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> assemble the unique segments of the genome, and
          then resolve repeats. The assembler that produced WGS1
          and the precursor to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> used algorithms and code
          that had weaknesses with repeat resolution. Between WGS1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WGS2</ENAMEX>, we corrected an error in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of
          repeat assembly - placement of repeat traces that are
          paired with an end read that lies in unique sequence.
          This allowed us to remove the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step in the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembler</ENAMEX>'s repeat reconstruction strategy, in which
          repeat traces were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> even when they
          were not paired with a unique read. This step was the
          cause of most of the inaccurate repeat reconstructions in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>. In addition, the overlap step of the assembler
          no longer requires explicit knowledge of genome-specific
          repeats. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between WGS2 and WGS3</TIMEX>, the primary improvement
          was the introduction of a sequence error-correction
          algorithm that allowed us to improve the sequence quality
          of every read by examining its relation to all the other
          reads. This allowed us to tighten the stringency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlap</ENAMEX>, leading to improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, especially of
          repetitive regions.
        
        
          Sequence comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">WGS 1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> assemblies were compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> by
          first finding the best possible mapping of those sequence
          segments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> that represent portions of the
          finished sequence. This task is complicated by nearly
          identical repeats that appear to align a portion of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> to every copy of the repeat. We proceeded in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps. First, every contig was compared against the
          sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> using a local variation of MUMmer
          to produce a collection of significant aligned segments.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, all of the scaffolds for which there are
          competing matches and are either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 50</TIMEX> kb and do not
          have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 98%</NUMEX> of their sequence matching, or are over
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 kb</TIMEX> and do not have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 60%</NUMEX> of their sequence
          matching, were removed from consideration. What remains
          are scaffolds that clearly contain sequence belong to the
          euchromatin, with the exception of small scaffolds that
          were almost certainly entirely repetitive. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the
          remaining matched segments were then reduced by a greedy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, non-overlapping sequence
          of matches that was considered to be the relevant tiling
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> by each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. The set of scaffolds
          having a segment match in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tiling was
          considered to be mapped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. The heaviest weight
          common subsequence (HCS) between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>
          orders was computed where the weight of each match was
          its length; this order was taken as the correct order
          within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WGS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Matched segments in the
          assemblies that were not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCS</ENAMEX> were considered order
          and orientation errors. We focused on the maximal set of
          matched segments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> without regard to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> and position on the contigs and scaffolds of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Thus we will see any inconsistencies
          between our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX>. The content of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> in the WGS assemblies were identified using a repeat
          database and a tandem repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">finder</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] run with the
          default settings.
