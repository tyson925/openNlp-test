        Numerous diseases require treatment by systemic delivery
        of a therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Repetitive or continuous
        injections are the only delivery method used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>
        practice. As a mean of reducing the inconvenience of
        multiple injections or implantation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini</ENAMEX> pumps, gene
        transfer technology may offer certain advantages. In order
        to achieve a high plasma concentration, whatever the vector
        used, the transfection of a large tissue mass is required
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. liver</ENAMEX> or muscle). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>, intravenous injection
        of a non-targeted vector - viruses or plasmid preparations
        - induces mainly transfection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and the spleen [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, transfection of other large organs by
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> has not been accomplished in by way of
        systemic delivery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The main inconveniences of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intravenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generation adenoviral
        vectors are their immunogenicity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and hepatic toxicity
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . The muscle as a large tissue mass is a candidate
        for production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant protein</ENAMEX>, but the transfection
        is limited to the injection site. Intra muscular
        administration is an attractive option as it avoids liver
        damage, but the levels reached are not satisfactory [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        An alternative to transfection with adenoviral vector is
        the injection of naked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into the muscle followed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>. The electroporation setting that induced
        high blood levels of excreted encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were defined
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bettan et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mir et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . This
        setting of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 pulses of 20 ms</NUMEX> and 200 V/cm at a frequency of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> increased the plasmid expression <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 2</NUMEX> logs in the
        C57Bl<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In this study, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generation adenovirus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> and plasmid electroporation of the muscle were
        compared to determine which one is the most suitable for
        obtaining high plasma levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of interest,
        namely: mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> and endostatin. mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> is a newly
        designed chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has angiostatic properties
        and endostatin is an angiostatic undergoing clinical trials
        that was used for comparison. As these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        interfering with tissue healing, the luciferase gene was
        used to study the local tissue damage caused by the two
        transfection methods.
        Another application of electroporation is the
        transfection of tumours. Human as well as rodent tumours
        vary greatly in expressing the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenovirus</ENAMEX>. Consequently, the gene transfer with adenoviral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> is very low in tumours that poorly express those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> alone is not very efficient
        transfectant, therefore the electroporation offers a
        possibility to transfect tumours resistant to viral
        infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . In this study, the electroporation of
        a non-permissive adenocarcinoma of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> is compared to
        the adenoviral vector.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Electroporation</ENAMEX> enhances plasmid gene expression in
          muscle
          The luciferase activity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57Bl/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> muscle was
          compared when transfected with plasmid alone or with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> followed by electroporation at various voltage.
          As depicted on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1electroporation</ENAMEX> increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> to a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> logs which was attained at
          180 V/cm. There was no more enhancing effect when the
          voltage was lowered to 100 V/cm. It remained to be
          determined if the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> log increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression
          was enough to obtain high blood levels of a secreted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgenic protein</ENAMEX>. Therefore, plasmids encoding
          mhATF-BPTI or human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endostatin</ENAMEX> were injected into the
          muscle with and without electroporation and the plasma
          level of the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was monitored. To verify
          that the injection had been properly performed, an equal
          amount of pAdapt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luc</ENAMEX> was added to the plasmid preparation
          and the mixture was injected in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (with and without pLuc), showing
          similar expression levels of the secreted encoded protein
          were pooled. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fig 2the</ENAMEX> injection of plasmid
          alone - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pATF</NUMEX>-BPTI or pEndostatin - did not lead to blood
          levels above the background. In contrast, plasmid
          injection followed by electroporation resulted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detectable blood</ENAMEX> levels of mhATF-BPTI (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 ng / ml</ENAMEX>) and of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hEndostatin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">25 ng / ml</ENAMEX>). These concentrations are
          however, far below what one can achieve with low dose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenovirus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 9iu) injected intravenously which results
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Plasmid electroporation does not compete with
          adenoviral vectors
          The volume of injection limits the quantity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenovirus</ENAMEX> or plasmid that can be injected into the
          gastrocnemius of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> without overflow. The maximal
          volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼L</NUMEX> and the highest concentrations of the
          available batches of either recombinant adenovirus (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10iu / 50 Î¼l</ENAMEX>) or plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50 Î¼g / 50 Î¼l</ENAMEX>) were employed to
          compare the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene transfer methods. The following
          electroporation conditions i.e. 200 V/cm, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> pulses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          ms at a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hz</ENAMEX>, were employed. The luciferase
          activity was measured in the gastrocnemius muscle of
          C57BL<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after the gene delivery. As depicted
          on figure 3transgene expression was roughly the same with
          adenoviral vector as with plasmid electroporation. The
          leakage of adenovirus out of the muscle induces a
          significant luciferase activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spleen</ENAMEX>. This level corresponds to an intravenous virus
          dose that is far below that found to be toxic for the
          liver. In contrast, the electroporation of the muscle was
          not accompanied by any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression in the liver
          but a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> showed a very low luciferase activity in
          the spleen. It is noteworthy that the background of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luciferase</ENAMEX> is higher in the muscle than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>.
          This was always observed and considered to be inherent to
          the detection method. To further investigate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> capacity of the muscle, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB
          were injected in the gastrocnemius of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The plasma
          levels of mhAB, monitored for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> after the
          injection, showed a peak at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 Â± 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> /ml on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 10</TIMEX> after
          administration. In view of the variation, transduction of
          the muscle with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad 5</ENAMEX> is not
          significantly more efficient that with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Local injury caused by muscle
          electroporation
          The damage induced by the electroporation was assessed
          by clinical observation, histological examination of
          muscle sections, and determination of creatine kinase in
          the plasma. Clinical symptoms were not observed in any of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> during the observation period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX>. At
          autopsy, practiced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 7 and 14 days</TIMEX> after the
          electroporation, macroscopic examination of the treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> showed local abnormalities and an oedema of the
          whole gastrocnemius muscle. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 2</TIMEX> the muscles were
          just a bit pale whereas at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7 and 14</TIMEX> the site of
          electroporation was white / creamy and felt hard upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palpation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 4</ENAMEX>). Microscopic examination revealed
          severe muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">necrosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 5</ENAMEX>) that was accompanied by a
          severe polynuclear eosinophilic and mast cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infiltration</ENAMEX>. The quantification of the pathological
          changes was assessed by determining the percentage of
          necrotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> on transversal sections of the muscle at
          the site of electroporation as well as by measuring the
          creatine kinase (CK) concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.
          Histological scoring confirmed that the muscle damage was
          maximal at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> after the electroporation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 6</ENAMEX>).
          Since the creatine kinase levels are not decreasing
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> after electroporation, the muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> must have continued over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>. In
          contrast, after an acute muscle injury like an ischemic
          infarction, the peak of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CK</ENAMEX> occurs within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">few hours</TIMEX>. This
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> peak may have occurred after the electroporation
          but was not monitored. Thus the elevation of the CK
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between day 7 and 14</TIMEX>, probably reflect the slow necrosis
          of the muscle fiber occurring during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX>. More
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, the electric pulse delivery caused on its
          own a severe rhabdomyolysis and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior</TIMEX> injection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> significantly increased the muscle damage, but the
          addition of naked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> did not influence the muscle
          injury.
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression
          from injected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was correlated with the voltage
          intensity up to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 v/cm.</ENAMEX> Thus, to determine a
          therapeutic window for the electroporation procedure, the
          voltage intensity was gradually diminished and the
          corresponding muscle damage assessed as previously (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The degree of necrosis was indeed correlated with the
          voltage intensity and decreased to background at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-100 V
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/cm.</ENAMEX> Unfortunately the luciferase expression levels
          decreased as fast as the muscle damage, and no
          therapeutic window could be found with these
          settings.
        
        
          Intra-tumoral electroporation as compared to
          transfection with adenovirus
          The permissiveness to adenoviral vectors of rodent as
          well as of human tumours varies within a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> logs.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the reasons is that viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> are dependant on
          membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to enter the cells. Adenoviral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> can be dramatically impaired in tumours that
          lack the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Therefore, transfection
          of naked DNA using electroporation might offer a
          possibility to transfect adenoviral-resistant tumours.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> bronchial adenocarcinoma was selected from among
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> tumours of different histological origin, as
          being very poorly permissive to adenovirus. The standard
          plasmid electroporation was compared to adenoviral gene
          delivery in subcutaneously growing tumours. As depicted
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig 8the</ENAMEX> electroporation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼g</NUMEX> pAdapt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc</ENAMEX> and the
          injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.10</NUMEX> 9iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt Luc</ENAMEX> induce roughly similar
          luciferase expression. However, a non-negligible
          proportion of adenoviruses leaks out of the tumour and
          reaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. Such leakage is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> times higher with
          intra tumoral delivery than after intra-muscular
          injection as judged by the luciferase activity measured
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. In contrast, there is no leakage of the
          luciferase activity from the tumour after plasmid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>. In order to assess the toxicity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leakage</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, graded
          doses of luciferase and empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> were injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">iv</ENAMEX> in
          Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. The intravenous route was chosen on
          basis of its consistent reproducibility. The luciferase
          activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> was measured and pathological
          changes were scored in liver sections. To avoid
          interference by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>, the liver damage were
          determined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> injected with an empty vector.
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9shows</TIMEX> that the leakage associated with the
          intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumoral</ENAMEX> injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9iu and 10 10iu</TIMEX> is in the
          range of vector doses that induce a mild to moderate
          liver damage. In an attempt to assess the therapeutic
          window of the adenoviral vector in this poorly permissive
          tumour, the number of transduced cells in the tumour was
          determined by injection of vectors encoding the
          Î²-galactosidase gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). It is assumed that no
          significant effect is expected from a therapeutic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX> (e.g thymidin kinase, mhATF-BPTI or endostatin)
          if the percentage of transduced tumour tissue is below
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>. The intra <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumoral</ENAMEX> injection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 10iu</NUMEX> adenovirus
          resulted in the transduction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1-2%</NUMEX> of the tumour
          cells, mostly limited around the needle track (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          This vector dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10iu</ENAMEX> is already toxic for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Thus the margin between efficacy and
          toxicity of the adenovirus in non-permissive tumour is
          not wide enough for therapeutic applications.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have used electroporation
        procedures to increase the gene expression of naked DNA
        injected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents muscles</ENAMEX> or in tumours [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . There
        are basically two types of muscle electroporation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) high voltage / <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short pulses</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) low
        voltage / long pulses. The highest plasma levels of an
        encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were obtained with low voltage (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 V /cm</ENAMEX>)
        long pulses (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ms) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> pulses at a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hz</ENAMEX>,
        i.e. the blood concentration of human secreted alkaline
        phosphatase reached values around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼g / ml</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The
        plasmid preparations described by others are most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> endotoxin free and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> is under a CMV
        promoter without any nuclear transport signal. Using these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTX</ENAMEX> electroporation device, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression after intra muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid</ENAMEX> injection could be
        enhanced by a factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX>. This led to plasma serum levels
        of endostatin around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 - 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> /ml. The dose of plasmid
        per injected muscle could not be easily increased for
        technical reasons. Given the maximal achievable plasmid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, the injection volume would have become too
        large for the muscle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bettan et al.</ENAMEX> have shown that
        increasing the dose from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î¼g to 300 Î</NUMEX>¼g by multiple
        injections resulted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 to 10</TIMEX> fold higher plasma levels.
        Thus, the intra muscular injection of naked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> followed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX> is considered by some as a means to obtain
        therapeutic plasma levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However this range
        of plasma concentration can also be achieved by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intramuscular</ENAMEX> or systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">generation Ad5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX>. The toxicity of these vectors is
        well documented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 5</NUMEX> ] . Systemic delivery of adenovirus
        vectors induces mild liver damage at low dose (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 9iu</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>) and severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow necrosis</ENAMEX> at high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 11iu</NUMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Intramuscular</ENAMEX> injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        10iu induces moderate local inflammation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . However,
        the local and systemic toxicity of the adenoviruses can be
        dramatically reduced by using gutless viruses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Notably, we observed severe muscle damage after the
        electric pulse delivery, which was worsened by the pre
        injection of saline but was not influenced by the presence
        of plasmid. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> dealing with electroporation gene
        transfer did not investigate the toxicity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>. All differences between those published
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX> and our parameters were tested to verify if they
        were responsible for the toxicity observed in our hands,
        but that was not the case. Similar damage occurred after
        using a simple anaesthesia (hypnorm) or in combination with
        muscle relaxants during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">electroporation</TIMEX>. Different
        positions of the leg between the electrodes were tested
        with no influence on the toxicity. No difference in muscle
        damage was observed between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The
        influence of the type of electrodes-needle or calliper -
        was not tested in our experiments. However, there are
        indications from previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> that both electrodes
        would induce similar muscle damage. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gehl et</ENAMEX> al.
        established that the toxicity of electroporation was
        correlated with the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> permeabilisation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        and that these was similar when using needles or calliper [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . Thus, it may be assumed that the electrode type is
        not of crucial influence on the toxicity induced by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroporation</ENAMEX>. Therefore we conclude that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhabdomyolysis</ENAMEX> developed in those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was not influenced
        by other parameters than the electric pulse settings and
        the pre-injection of buffer. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have
        reported muscle damage after plasmid electroporation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathiesen</ENAMEX> described muscle necrosis after plasmid
        electroporation that increased with the cumulative duration
        of the pulses and that the necrotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> never expressed
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartikka et al.</ENAMEX> attributed the muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> to the presence of plasmid, but this conclusion is
        difficult to interpret since the elevation of serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPK</ENAMEX> was
        not influenced by the plasmid. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> described by
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and us have much in common with those induced
        by electrocution chocks. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        , in an attempt to mimic non-thermally mediated muscle
        injury in electrical trauma, used similar electric field
        strength and pulse length as for plasmid electroporation.
        This resulted in quantitatively and qualitatively very
        similar muscle damage to what we found with the
        electroporation procedure. Thus, there is strong evidence
        that muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">electroporation</ENAMEX>, as it usually performed, is
        severely damaging and reduces plasmid expression to the
        survival cells. Furthermore, even if electrical injuries
        generally involve much higher field strength [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , it is
        noteworthy that some pathologic changes found after
        electric shock resemble the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> observed in muscle after
        electroporation i.e. the decolouration in bands of the
        muscle fibbers described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morita et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau et al.</ENAMEX> have made attempts to improve the
        electroporation protocol by introducing new settings,
        consisting in the combination of high voltage and low
        voltages pulses, that are inducing less permeabilisation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Even if these combined protocols
        seems to be slightly less toxic, there is still much
        improvement needed to compete with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of
        adenoviral vectors as a method to transfect muscle in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        In contrast to intramuscular delivery, the
        electroporation of tumours seems to offer a wider
        therapeutic window. In case of tumours that are poorly
        permissive to adenovirus, it is difficult to transduce a
        large number of tumour cells with adenoviral vectors
        without inducing severe liver damage. In contrast, the
        systemic toxicity is not a risk with plasmid
        electroporation as it is with adenoviral transfection. The
        possible damage induced by the electroporation could not be
        easily determined due to the high background of necrosis in
        the tumour tissue, but if it occurs it could only add to
        the therapeutic effect. In our experiments the
        concentration of plasmid preparations limited the maximal
        dose that could be delivered into the tumour, but If this
        technical obstacle of producing highly concentrated plasmid
        was solved, electroporation would offer an applicable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transfection</ENAMEX> technique for viral-resistant tumours that are
        accessible with an electroporation device i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and
        neck or skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>.

          plasma creatin phosphokinase (CPK), hEndostatin, and
          mhATF-BPTI, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were anaesthetised with isoflurane, bled
          by tail vein cut and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was collected in EDTA
          tubes. All animal procedures were performed in accordance

          ATF-BPTI <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were constructed as described previously [

          All vectors were produced on PER.C6â„¢ using standard

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animal Health</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>). Rear legs and the flank
          skin were shaved for the muscle and tumoral

          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼g</NUMEX>) or of adenovirus (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu) were injected slowly
          to prevent back flow in the gastrocnemius with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> Gauge
          needle. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> plasmids were injected simultaneously, the
          volume of the mixture was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tumours</ENAMEX> had a

          contact. The distance between the electrodes were usually
          around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-6</ENAMEX> mm. The electrodes were applied on the muscle
          until they came in complete contact with the skin, but
          without compressing the muscle. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight 20</NUMEX>-ms pulses were
