        The identification of individual genes governing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> variation is crucial to understand the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanistic</ENAMEX> basis of quantitative inheritance and
        ultimately provide information about the design of optimal
        breeding strategies in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        Quantitative genetics based on new statistical and
        computational technologies has advanced to the point at
        which individual genes can be detected and mapped on
        chromosomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The underpinning for the detection
        and mapping of genes is founded on their particular
        segregation pattern. For a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pedigree</ENAMEX> derived from inbred
        lines, the segregation pattern of a gene can be exactly
        predicted. In this situation, quantitative genetic theory
        can lay a sufficient foundation for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene detection</ENAMEX> and,
        thus, the properties of a detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> can be adequately
        described by its effect and genomic location. However, for
        outcrossing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, such as forest <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, in which
        inbred lines are not available, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also display
        population genetic properties [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Hence, the foundation
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene detection</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> should be
        established on a combination of quantitative genetics and
        population genetics. The estimation of the population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> properties of genes, such as allele frequencies and
        the degree of disequilibrium, can not only enhance the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> and power of gene detection, but also is
        fundamentally important to our understanding of population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and evolution [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        We present a strategy for investigating the existence of
        genes in an arbitrarily complex progeny test based on
        phenotype data and estimating the effects of these genes on
        a quantitative trait and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> properties under
        the maximum likelihood framework. Only a limited number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> studies have been performed to detect genes
        based on the phenotypic data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] , and
        none of these studies have considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and
        evolutionary genetic properties of genes. Our study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> can be derived from a natural population instead
        of inbred lines as used for general agronomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">finite</ENAMEX> number of unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are randomly selected
        from a natural population and are mated to produce progeny
        tests under a mating design such as factorial or diallel.
        In a recent paper, we used such progeny tests to derive a
        model for detecting major genes affecting a quantitative
        trait [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . This model has power to estimate the effect
        of drift errors on genetic variation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hybridization</TIMEX>,
        thus providing information about dynamic changes of the
        genetic architecture of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> under artificial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. However, the estimates of population genetic
        parameters from the progeny test using the above model
        cannot be generalized to the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from which
        the mating design is derived. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we developed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hierarchical</ENAMEX> model for analyzing the pattern of gene
        segregation at both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and family levels, which
        thus can provide estimates of genetic parameters in two
        successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Estimates of
        population genetic parameters using this hierarchical model
        can reasonably infer the genetic structure of the original
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. A forest tree example is used to demonstrate
        the application of the new statistical model for gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX>.

          Mating design
          A finite number of unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are randomly
          selected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and male parents
          to generate a 
          I Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J</ENAMEX> factorial mating design. Based on
          sampling theory, these selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> have
          genotypes at the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> whose counts follow the same
          multinomial distribution as those in the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, with probability vector 
          
            p

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ). The segregation of progeny
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypes</ENAMEX> in the mating design depends on how the
          major-locus genotypes segregate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) among the selected

          J male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> having the same
          pattern as in the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is viewed as the

          Mendelian segregation ratio, viewed as the family-level
          segregation. To understand the genetic structure of the

          derived from this two-level segregation will not be

          for large designs with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or for the case where

        existence of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in the progeny test. For example,
        in the family derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clone-5 Ã— TA-1-68</ENAMEX>, the
        phenotypic distribution is a mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, showing the existence of a segregating gene.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1also</NUMEX> indicates different segregation patterns among
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, with some more smooth and others more waved,
        thus suggesting that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are heterozygous with
        their alleles segregating in the progeny.
        The effect and genotypic frequencies of the major gene
        are estimated using the hierarchical model assuming two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>. Since no significant difference is detected
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> locations, we only report the result based on
        pooled data. With probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one</NUMEX>, parents

        estimate of residual variance is = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">218.676</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.09</NUMEX>. Here,
        the estimates of standard errors for the parameter
        estimators are obtained based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX> information
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . We also fitted the model under the null
        hypothesis that there is no major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> with a single normal
        distribution. The likelihood ratio test has ( 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), suggesting the
        existence of a major gene for height growth. The ratio of
        the dominant to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> effect for this major gene is less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>, which implies that it affects the stem height
        growth in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> manner.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> genetic parameters of this major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> are
        estimated based on the genotypes of the parents detected.
        The genotype frequencies estimated are identical for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genotypes, i.e. 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> = 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> = 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/3</NUMEX>. In consequence, the allele
        frequencies are also same ( 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX>). Thus, the mixed breeding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of 
        P. tremulodes and 
        P. tremula is not at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equilibrium</ENAMEX>, because the genotype frequencies are not
        products of the corresponding allele frequencies. The
        coefficient of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> disequilibrium is estimated
        as . The estimate of allele frequencies and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disequilibrium</ENAMEX> using our hierarchical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be well
        generalized to the original breeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from which
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were sampled. However, one should be cautious
        about the accuracy of the estimator due to the small sample
        size.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Simulation</ENAMEX>
        The behavior of the EM estimators is evaluated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>

        measurement using a normal and log-normal distribution.
        The results from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> simulation study are
        summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of the plots is for
        the simulation where trait measurements are simulated from
        a normal distribution. The bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> corresponds to
        lognormal data. In each plot we graphed the ideal estimates
        of the parameter (assuming that we know the genotypes of
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>) versus our estimates based on the EM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>. Mean squared errors are also indicated in the
        plots. It is seen from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2that all four</NUMEX> parameters can
        be estimated quite accurately in the normal case while they
        are slightly biased for the lognormal data.
      
      
        Discussion
        We have derived a hierarchical model for detecting major
        genes affecting a quantitative trait based on progeny tests
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outcrossing species</ENAMEX>. The new model takes into account
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> genetic properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and is expected
        to enhance the accuracy, precision and power of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX>. The information about the population behavior of
        genes estimated from this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is fundamentally important
        to our understanding of the genetic architecture of a
        natural or experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and is also useful for
        the design of sound breeding strategies for agricultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> and forest <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        We used an example from interspecific <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">aspen hybrids</ENAMEX> to
        illustrate the application of our gene-detecting model. The
        model has successfully identified a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> with
        additive effects on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second year</TIMEX> stem growth in the hybrid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">aspens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> effect of genes on height growth in
        young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poplars</ENAMEX> was also observed in a molecular marker
        experiment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In this marker experiment, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
        quantitative trait locus was found to explain almost a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> of the total phenotypic variation in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> year
        height growth. The result from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">aspen hybrids</ENAMEX> was
        consistent with that from a simulation experiment based on
        a mating scheme analogous to that used in our real example.
        The consistency of the results from the simulation study
        suggests that the model proposed here can be adequately
        used to detect genes of large effect on the phenotypes.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> will have immediate applications for many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in which progeny tests have been established for a
        number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Most of these tests are maintained
        in different locations and measured <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, thus offering
        desirable opportunities to address <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important questions:
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) How does the genes interact with environment? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) What
        is the developmental plasticity of gene expression? In our
        real example, no evidence has been obtained for the change
        of gene expression at the major locus detected over the two
        field trials, despite their dramatic differences in
        climate, soil properties and silvicultural measures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        . If the stability of the expression of this gene over a
        range of environments is confirmed by more accurate
        genotype determination methods, e.g. based on genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. It will have a tremendous application in breeding
        for stable cultivars of forest tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        Our analysis and simulation is based on diallelic
        inheritance. But multiallelic inheritance can be similarly
        considered, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> parameters should be introduced.
        Also, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> assumes the segregation of a single gene in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progeny</ENAMEX> tests. The principle behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be
        extended to consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Modelling multiple
        genes may be closer to biological reality, because the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">linkage</ENAMEX>, epistatic interaction and genetic association
        among genes are considered. However, the consideration of
        these relationships needs to estimate an increased number
        of unknown genetic parameters. Finally, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is based
        on a balanced factorial design. For some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, like
        mammals, mating designs are frequently unbalanced because
        of limited resources or reproductive difficulties. It is
        very important to extend our analysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unbalanced</ENAMEX> mating design of any complexity. For all of
        these extensions mentioned above, maximum likelihood
        approaches may not be sufficient owing to an increasing
        dimension of parameter space. A more powerful computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tool</ENAMEX>, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Markov</ENAMEX> chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carol</ENAMEX> methods, may be needed
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] to make our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> more tractable in real
        applications.
