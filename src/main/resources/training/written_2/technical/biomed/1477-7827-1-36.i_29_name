        Estrogens affect a variety of tissues, including
        reproductive tissues, bone, liver, cardiovascular system
        and brain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> the classical and non-classical
        estrogen sensitive tissues and cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Although
        several previous studies have shown that human placenta
        binds estradiol (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E2</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] , and estrogens influence
        various aspects of placental function and fetal development
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and primates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] , the placenta
        as a target for estrogens is missing. The reason might be
        an inability of former studies to detect expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and its immunoreactivity in
        placental components [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Yet, forms of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estradiol</ENAMEX> receptor of differing stability have been
        detected in human placental tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . This indicates
        that some determinants of placental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> may possibly
        undergo denaturation during tissue processing and become
        undetectable, e.g. in paraffin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>.
        On the other hand, we have recently shown ERÎ± expression
        in human term placenta by western blot analysis. ERÎ±
        immunoreactivity was confined to villous and cultured
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotrophoblast</ENAMEX> (CT) cells but not syncytiotrophoblast
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>). We also localized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in villous
        vascular pericytes and extravillous (amniotic) fibroblasts
        but not in villous endothelial cells, amniotic epithelium,
        extravillous trophoblast (EVT) or decidual cells. In tissue
        culture, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> stimulated trophoblast differentiation into
        syncytial aggregates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . To our knowledge, no attempt
        has been so far made to study placental expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        beta (ERÎ²).
        Although it was first believed that estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        were predominantly cytoplasmic, it was later proposed that
        they are located exclusively within the nucleus. It is now
        clear that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can be found in both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> and nucleus, with the ratio dependent upon the
        cell type and physiological conditions. Some studies also
        indicate that estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors reside</ENAMEX> on the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and modulate cellular activity without directly
        associating with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human ERÎ²</ENAMEX> is encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">477</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~52 kDa</NUMEX>) and has substantial homology to ERÎ±
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66 kDa</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . Although both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptors</ENAMEX> (ERs)
        can be expressed in various estrogen-sensitive tissues and
        cells, evidence is accumulating that their expression
        varies during cellular proliferation and differentiation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . It appears quite clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> has biological
        roles that are distinct from those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>, and certain
        results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> can have effects opposite to
        those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Although some in vitro studies suggest both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> may play
        redundant roles, a dissimilar tissue distribution indicates
        otherwise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> (Î±ERKO) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> knockout (Î²ERKO) female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        possess a normally developed reproductive tract and
        maintain expression of the opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The Î±ERKO
        female is infertile and exhibits a hypoplastic uterus that
        is refractory to estrogens. The ovaries of the Î±ERKO female
        are consistently polycystic and lack evidence of
        spontaneous ovulation. In contrast, the Î²ERKO female
        exhibits a hormonally responsive uterus and grossly normal
        ovaries, but is subfertile in terms of the frequency and
        size of litters. Double <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER knockout</ENAMEX> (DERKO) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infertile</ENAMEX>, possess the expected reproductive tract
        structures, but exhibit a remarkably distinct ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> characterized by postnatal loss of oocytes and
        redifferentiation of the remaining somatic cells to
        Sertolilike cells. This "sexreversal" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DERKO</ENAMEX> ovary is
        accompanied by the ectopic expression of testisspecific
        genes (reviewed in reference [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ).
        A recent study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Î²ERKO mice</ENAMEX> has shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> is not
        required for the normal prepubertal development of the
        mammary gland but for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and adhesion of
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> during pregnancy and hence for
        differentiated tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . These
        observations indicate a possibility of complementary
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">sequential</NUMEX>) roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> appears to be
        required for the basic development of estrogen sensitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> seems to be required for their functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX>.
        Besides the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>, additional related forms have
        been identified at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> level, often denoted as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> B".
        They would generate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~56</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61 and 63</TIMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        . Recently developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> made to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human ERÎ²</ENAMEX> hormone binding domain have been shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identify ~</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional ~62-64</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from granulosa cells of several mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunohistochemical</ENAMEX> studies with these antibodies
        revealed nuclear-specific localization of the ERÎ² protein
        in granulosa cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat ovary</ENAMEX> and in epithelial and
        some stromal cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat epididymis</ENAMEX>. Epitope
        mapping studies indicated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E12 and F12</TIMEX> antibodies
        recognize overlapping peptide sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        region of the hormone-binding domain, a region that is
        highly conserved among species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villous</ENAMEX> CT cells are a type of stem cell which divides
        during pregnancy including the term placenta [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        However, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> is symmetric, i.e., resulting in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> identical cells, both cells should either proliferate
        or differentiate. The former situation might result in
        placental site trophoblastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> or choriocarcinoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        ] , the latter in the loss of the ability of the villous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trophoblast</ENAMEX> to proliferate. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biologists</ENAMEX> began to gain insight into the cellular
        mechanisms by which a cell divides into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells of
        different developmental potentials, a process known as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asymmetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> is a fundamental
        means of generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> diversity and may involve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extrinsic</ENAMEX> or intrinsic factors. With extrinsic factors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">daughter cells</ENAMEX> are equivalent after separation but adopt
        different fates due to their interactions with the
        environment. With intrinsic factors, unequal amounts of
        cell-fate determinants are distributed into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells
        prior to their separation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Among the intrinsic
        factors underlying asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, the interactions of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Numb</ENAMEX> differentiation-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notch</ENAMEX>
        proliferation-associated signaling is the model most widely
        studied, ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Mammalian cells known to exhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> include diverse cell types such as
        neuronal cells, thymocytes, and satellite cells involved in
        myogenesis, and the list is growing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] .
        The aim of present study was to investigate expression
        and localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> in normal term placentae as
        compared to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>. Our data indicate that virtually
        all cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX> of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placenta</ENAMEX> express
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>, or both. In addition, we identified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetric</ENAMEX> ERÎ± segregation in dividing villous CT
        cells.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Tissues
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> normal placentae from deliveries <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 36</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 weeks</TIMEX> of pregnancy were investigated. The source of
          placental tissue was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with normal pregnancies
          admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Tennessee Medical Center</ENAMEX>.
          Excluded were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood transferable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, and apparent
          ascendent placental infections. The study was approved by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Tissue processing
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processing</ENAMEX> started within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-60 minutes</TIMEX> after
          delivery. Tissue blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placental samples</ENAMEX> were frozen

          Dual color immunohistochemistry for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thy</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of
          mesenchymal cells and cytokeratin of epithelial
          cells
          To determine a relationship between placental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchymal</ENAMEX> and epithelial components, the slides were
          subjected to dual color immunohistochemistry for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thy</ENAMEX>-1
          and cytokeratin (CK) immunoreactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1/CK</ENAMEX>). The
          slides were first immunostained for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> differentiation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of mesenchymal cells (placental fibroblasts,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pericytes</ENAMEX> and decidual cells) as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] , but without hematoxylin counterstain and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydratation</ENAMEX>. Briefly, specimens were washed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffered saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) and incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-anti human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thy-1</ENAMEX>, clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F10-44-1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) reacting with placental villous pericytes,
          extravillous fibroblasts, and decidual cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          After extensive washing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, specimens were incubated
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> peroxidase conjugate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SwAM; SEVAC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czech Republic</ENAMEX>) diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX> and
          preabsorbed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat kidney homogenate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antigen-antibody</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were detected by standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diaminobenzidine</ENAMEX> technique (brown color).
          After extensive washes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, the slides were
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> with mouse anti-human
          cytokeratin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, clone DC10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO Corporation</ENAMEX>,
          Carpinteria, CA) diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX> and peroxidase-coupled
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> as above. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antigen-antibody</ENAMEX> complexes
          were detected by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DABNi</ENAMEX> detection kit according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplier</ENAMEX>'s manual (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>,
          CA), giving the substrate dark blue color. This
          contrasted with the brown color resulting from the first
          sequence of immunoreagents (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">immunostaining</ENAMEX>). The
          slides were dehydrated and mounted, without hematoxylin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterstain</ENAMEX>. A control procedure consisted of dual color
          immunohistochemistry as above, but both primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>.
          Since the diaminobenzidine reaction product masks the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> and catalytic sites of the first sequence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreagents</ENAMEX> and thus prevents interaction with the
          reagents of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , a possibility of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expression in the same cell types has been
          investigated. Therefore, another set of slides was
          similarly processed, with the opposite order of primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CK/Thy-1</ENAMEX>). In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of slides
          were immunostained for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> or CK expression alone,
          followed by hematoxylin counterstain (not shown).

          Peroxidase immunohistochemistry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and

          Tissue sections were processed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and ERÎ²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoexpression</ENAMEX> using indirect single color
          immunoperoxidase immunohistochemistry [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>,

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSAB</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> (DAKO). The slides were dehydrated and
          mounted, without hematoxylin counterstain. Sections
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> without the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> but with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> were
          used as negative controls. Images were captured and
          processed as indicated above. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERÎ±/ERÎ²</ENAMEX> dual color
          immunohistochemistry for co-localization of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX>.
          Specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was confirmed

          placental membranes (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and 2</NUMEX>)
          We used dual color immunohistochemistry without
          hematoxylin counterstain to show placental mesenchymal
          cells and epithelial structures (left column, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Parallel sections were investigated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid</TIMEX> column)
          and utilized for controls, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> was used instead of
          the ERÎ² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (right column). Mesenchymal cells
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (brown color)
          were represented by pericytes (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D) and decidual cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1J</ENAMEX>). Epithelial structures expressing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokeratin</ENAMEX> (blue color) were represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> (s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1A) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Dand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1J</ENAMEX>). Strong ERÎ²
          immunoreactivity was detected in villous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) and
          weaker staining was apparent in villous sinusoids
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">arrowheads</NUMEX>).
          In placental membranes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1E), strong ERÎ²
          immunoreactivity was confined to amniotic epithelium (e)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>). Weak staining was associated with connective
          tissue cells and decidual cells (compare with control,

          There was, however a variability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> expression in
          amniotic epithelium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2ANote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+ (solid arrow) and
          ERÎ²- nuclei (white arrow). In the basal plate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX> also
          exhibited strong (solid arrow) and diminishing ERÎ²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (white arrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Placental
          vessels showed ERÎ² immunoreactivity restricted to the
          endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>, during

          immunoreactivity was apparent (solid arrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D).
          However, nuclei of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">differentiated ST</ENAMEX> were unstained
          (white arrow). Decidual cells occasionally (a few cells
          in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">placentae</ENAMEX> investigated) exhibited nuclear ERÎ±
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> E, compare with control, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> F). Strong ERÎ²
          immunoreactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX> (positive control) is shown in
          panel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and a lack of immunoreactivity on a parallel

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We observed that dividing
          CT cells prior to separation (arched arrow) show strong
          ERÎ± expression in the parental cell (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>; distant from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>)
          and weak expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) merging with very
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrow ST</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2</NUMEX> Î¼m, yellow arrows; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). Note that the
          dividing cell exhibits a perpendicular (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 degrees</NUMEX>) long
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">axis</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the ST layer (see discussion for
          importance and comment). Additional differentiating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> CT cells (d') show brown/blue color contrasting
          with dark blue of differentiated syncytium (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">st</ENAMEX>). There
          were also isolated CT cells in the villous stroma
          (quiescent, q; or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ), which showed very weak nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>.
          Another strongly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+ parental CT <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in the villous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stroma</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Differentiating daughter</ENAMEX> CT
          cells associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> showed gradual diminution of ERÎ±
          and increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> (brown and blue arrows) merging with
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+ (blue) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST. Note</ENAMEX> that single color staining in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Dindicates that the CT cells merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> (solid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>) exhibit nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>. We also occasionally detected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symmetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CT</ENAMEX> resulting in two parental cells
          with strong nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3CNote the
          parallel long axis of dividing cells to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>
          and relatively wide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~8</NUMEX> Î¼m, orange arrows). Panel D is
          a control for dual color immunohistochemistry, where both
          primary antibodies were replaced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>.
          Quantitative evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quiescent</ENAMEX> (q), parental (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3E. The ERÎ±
          immunoreactivity was lowest in quiescent cells and
          highest in parental cells during asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>.
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells showed significant diminution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> when compared to parental cells. Statistical analysis
          indicated overall ANOVA 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>, and differences
          between all columns

          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in
          cultured trophoblast (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4and 5</NUMEX>)
          To determine an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> and ERÎ±
          immunoreactivity with differentiation of mononucleated
          trophoblast cells into syncytial aggregates, we
          investigated isolated cytotrophoblast cells and young and
          mature syncytial aggregates in tissue cultures. The
          trophoblast cultures showed a lack of ERÎ²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in isolated trophoblast cells (white
          arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). However, strong staining accompanied
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">young</ENAMEX> (small) syncytial aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>, panels A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>).
          Cytotrophoblast cells associated with small aggregates
          showed an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity (arrowhead,
          panel B). Development of mature ST aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>, panel
          C) was associated with gradual diminution of nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> (solid > white arrows), but persisting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic ERÎ²</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity. Panel D shows control
          staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-goat</ENAMEX> secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. In
          contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity was detected in isolated
          cultured trophoblast cells (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> persisted in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syncytial</ENAMEX> aggregates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">panels E</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) but diminished in mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>, panels F
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). Panel D shows control staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and
          anti-mouse secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          Quantitative evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and ERÎ²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in late tissue cultures is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity was highest in isolated CT cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>), moderate in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syncytial</ENAMEX> aggregates (yST) and
          virtually undetectable (not significantly different from
          background values) in mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">syncytia</TIMEX> (mST). However, ERÎ²
          immunoreactivity was virtually undetectable in isolated
          CT cells, highest in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syncytial</ENAMEX> aggregates, and
          moderate expression persisted in mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">syncytia</TIMEX>.
          Statistical analysis has shown overall ANOVA 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), and differences
          between columns with different superscripts

          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² proteins</ENAMEX> in vivo and in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
          We used western blot analysis in order to evaluate
          overall expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² proteins</ENAMEX> in vivo and in
          cultured trophoblast. Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> proteins
          was detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>, isolated trophoblast cells at time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          (t:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>), and early (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>) and late trophoblast cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> showed higher expression in time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and
          early cultures when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> and late trophoblast
          culture.
          We also tested the specificity of primary antibodies
          in western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was pre-absorbed
          with blocking peptide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA/ERÎ²</ENAMEX>), no bands were detected
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> bands in original <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> extracts

          Our observations from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> show nuclear specific

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Avs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7C</TIMEX>). The immunoreactivity of F12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was similar, but the nuclei of cytotrophoblast
          cells associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> were also stained (white arrows,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B). Both, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E12</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7D, vs.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7E) showed nuclear immunoreactivity
          specifically localized in amniotic fibroblasts (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> (full arrowhead) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX> (white

          Western blot analysis with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E12 and F12</TIMEX> antibodies
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A) showed an abundant expression of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~64</NUMEX> kDa ERÎ²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein variant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">64Î²</ENAMEX>) in trophoblast cultures. The F12
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> also revealed a distinct ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">68Î²</ENAMEX>),
          above the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">66 kDa ERÎ±</TIMEX>. The expression of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          higher in time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and cultured trophoblast (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 6-8</ENAMEX>), as
          compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> also specifically
          identified a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 kDa</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">35Î²</ENAMEX>), probably ERÎ² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fragment
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ), higher in trophoblast cultures (lanes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 8</NUMEX>). However, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> and
          trophoblast cultures from this placenta, no prominent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~52 kDa</NUMEX> was detected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E12 and F12</TIMEX> antibodies
          (lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A).
          For comparison, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> shows a distinct single band
          revealed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ² N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~52 kDa</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">52Î²</ENAMEX>)

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h-151</ENAMEX>) indicates a distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">66 kDa</NUMEX> (green
          arrowhead, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66Î±</NUMEX>), not interfering with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~64</NUMEX> band
          identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E12 antibody</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~64 and 68</NUMEX> kDa bands
          identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibody</ENAMEX>. Note higher molecular weight
          narrow bands (open arrowheads), probably nonspecific

          Figure 8Bshows western blot analysis of another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placenta</ENAMEX>. The expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~64</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> is most prominent
          in early culture (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from chorionic

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8C) shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> fold increased
          expression in trophoblast cultures as compared to the CV
          and time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX>. Overall ANOVA was 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>, post test revealed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> differences between
          columns with different superscripts. The data indicate
          that the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~64</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² protein</ENAMEX> with hormone
          binding domain significantly increases in early cultures
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>) and high expression persists in late

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~52 kDa</NUMEX>) immunoreactivity in various
          placental cell types is summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. From
          trophoblast cell types, the villous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> expressed ERÎ±
          only, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX> showed ERÎ². However, CT cells
          merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">syncytial</ENAMEX> aggregates showed
          expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX>. Other epithelial, mesenchymal or
          vascular cell types showed either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> (pericytes) or ERÎ²
          (endothelial cells, amniotic epithelium, decidua). Rare
          decidual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> showed nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, nuclear
          and/or cytoplasmic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> varied depending on
          the cell type/stage (see superscripts in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> were also detected in some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the extravillous
          connective tissue. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2also</ENAMEX> shows that expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> with hormone binding domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~64 kDa</NUMEX>) is exclusively
          nuclear, associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX>, and amniotic epithelium
          and fibroblasts. Therefore, these placental cell types
          appear to be responsive to estrogens via the nuclear ERÎ²
          hormone binding domain.
        
        
          Expression of the cell cycle-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          the placenta and derived cultures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>)
          To understand better the role of other proteins
          involved in the regulation of trophoblast proliferation
          and differentiation in vivo and in vitro, we also
          compared expression of some cell cycle-related proteins
          in vivo and in vitro. In normal placentae, the expression
          of cyclin E (cE), which is involved in the stimulation of
          cell cycle progression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , was low, as was that of
          p27 (cE antagonist) promoting terminal differentiation of
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lane 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A). This is in agreement with
          occasional trophoblast proliferation in normal term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentae</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , apparently not prevented by high p27
          expression. In early cultures, expression of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> increased significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lane 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A; see
          also panel B for quantitative evaluation). During
          culture, initially high expression of cE significantly
          decreased at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 and 70 hours</TIMEX>, and remained low at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. However, moderate expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> in early
          cultures significantly increased at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 hours</TIMEX> and remained
          extremely high till the end of the culture. These trends
          were observed in all cultures from normal placentae
          investigated. Such observations indicate that the p27
          antiproliferative effect may play an important role in
          the prevention of cultured trophoblast proliferation and,
          therefore, promote an overall tendency of cultured
          trophoblast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> toward terminal differentiation (see
          also Discussion).

        To our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study showing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placental ERÎ²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression by western blot analysis
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity in placental cell types. We also
        show a comparison of placental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> protein
        expression and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX>. Our observations
        indicate that various cellular components of human placenta
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> or ERÎ². Furthermore, we show in vivo and
        in vitro that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+/ERÎ²- CT cells differentiate into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±+/ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+ young and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±-/ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+ mature ST aggregates.
        In situ hybridization and immunolocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> in a variety of reproductive tract tissues in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> have shown that in most instances either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> or ERÎ²
        is expressed in a particular cell type, although some cell
        types, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leydig</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, ovarian surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelium</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelial</ENAMEX> and stromal cells of the uterus and breast, may
        show expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . However, since
        only a proportion of cells were detected to express <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> in a single color immunohistochemistry [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , such an
        approach cannot demonstrate coexpression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> in a
        particular cell, nor indicate eventual transition from one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> subtype to another during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">differentiation</TIMEX>.
        However, recent double color immunohistochemistry
        experiments indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the mouse proximal
        efferent ductule epithelium can be separated into three
        types with distinct expression of ERs: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">+/ERÎ²-</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±+/ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+ and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±-/ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> did not
        provide any functional explanation of these observations.
        Nevertheless, our study also shows that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> expression can be detected in villous trophoblast.
        Moreover, our data indicate that there is a switch in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        expression from type (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+/ERÎ²- to type (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±+/ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+
        and finally to type (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±-/ERÎ²</ENAMEX>+ during trophoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> in vivo, and this observation was confirmed
        by the study of trophoblast differentiation in vitro.
        As mentioned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>, recent studies of the
        functional significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Î²ERKO mice</ENAMEX> show that ERÎ±
        is sufficient for basic differentiation of
        estrogen-sensitive tissue. However, a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> results
        in a defect in terminally differentiated tissue morphology
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> expression is required for
        terminal differentiation of estrogen-dependent cells. Our
        study concurs with such observations, since we show that
        ERÎ² expression is associated with terminal differentiation
        of trophoblast. Moreover, we show a switch from nuclear to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> ERÎ² expression in terminally differentiated ST
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX>. In addition, the decidual cells, which are known
        to exhibit degenerative changes at term [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , show
        marked diminution of cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX>. This suggests that
        terminal aging and degeneration of estrogen responsive
        cells are accompanied by a progressive loss of ERÎ²
        expression.
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> single and dual color
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> experiments show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> CT
        cells derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>+ parental cells coexpress both ERs
        during early stages of differentiation, and lose ERÎ± during
        their terminal differentiation into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ST. The</ENAMEX>
        differentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> was associated with very narrow (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~2</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼m) ST</ENAMEX>, which may need complementation by additional CT
        cells to function. However, the parental and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells
        showed in vivo differences in nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity
        prior to their complete separation. While the parental cell
        showed high nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cell associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> showed marked diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> immunoreactivity and an
        increase of differentiation-associated ERÎ² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        These observations parallel recent studies that
        postmitotic cells may exhibit asymmetric distribution of
        the differentiation-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> prior to their
        separation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asymmetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> may involve extrinsic
        (influence of adjacent cells) or intrinsic factors. Among
        the intrinsic factors underlying asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interactions of the Numb</ENAMEX> differentiation-associated protein
        with Notch proliferation-associated signaling is the model
        most widely studied, ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> to mammals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . When the neuronal progenitor
        cells undergo asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> in neuronal tissue
        cell culture) they produce neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells to which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Numb protein segregates preferentially</ENAMEX>, and such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
        cells show an enhanced differentiation of neuronal
        processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Numb</ENAMEX> is firstly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with one pole of the plasma membrane of a
        dividing cell, and subsequently with one of the two
        resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nuclei</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 45</NUMEX> ] . Our study indicates that
        preservation of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> postmitotic cells
        is associated with the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> to replicate and
        diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> and appearance of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> dictates a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cell that is committed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differentiate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10can be used to explain, at
        least in part, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> in proliferation and
        differentiation of other estrogen-dependent cell types.
        However, it has to be considered that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> are certainly not
        the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which are involved in decisions of
        estrogen-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to proliferate or differentiate.
        At least cell cycle related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, either suppressors or
        facilitators, and growth factors and cytokines produced by
        stromal cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 46 47 48 49</NUMEX> ] should be considered in
        addition to the promitotic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2 mediated</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX>.
        Figure 10may not be applicable for transformed cells with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">abnormal ER variants</ENAMEX>, or cells exhibiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> type of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>. For example, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> only may indicate that
        differentiation but not proliferation is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen-dependent.</ENAMEX>
        Former studies also indicated that the decision between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symmetric</ENAMEX> and asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> in vivo depends on the
        mitotic spindle orientation. During fly neurogenesis, the
        neuroblasts delaminate from a monolayer of ectodermal
        cells. The ectodermal cells at the surface of the
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> divide with the axes of their mitotic
        spindle parallel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the ectodermal monolayer.
        In contrast, a neuroblast divides along the apical-basal
        axis, so that the axes of its mitotic spindles are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perpendicular</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the ectodermal layer. Thus,
        the mitotic spindle of the neuroblast has to reorientate by
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 degrees</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the ectodermal layer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ]
        .The orientation of the mitotic spindle correlates with the
        asymmetric distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Numb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Ashows</TIMEX> that similar perpendicular orientation,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 degrees</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ST layer</ENAMEX> (toward the
        villous core), applies for asymmetrically dividing villous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>. Hence, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>, one pole of dividing CT cells is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> and the other with the
        mesenchymal villous core (stroma). It is possible to
        speculate that the poles of dividing CT cells are
        influenced differently - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the juxta</NUMEX>-syncytial pole toward
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and juxta-mesenchymal toward proliferation.
        Therefore, the extrinsic factors (type of neighboring
        cells) may dictate asymmetric segregation of intrinsic
        factors determining the fate of dividing cells. In other
        words, asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> in vivo may be a result of the
        influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. If so,
        the extrinsic factors should be viewed as inducers and
        intrinsic factors as effectors of asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>.
        Based on available data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 45 50 51 52</NUMEX> ] and our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX>, a possible sequence of events involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of villous CT cells is given in Figure
        11A. Note an involvement of stromal (stimulation of CT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>) and ST signaling (stimulation of cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>). Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11Bindicates</TIMEX> that symmetric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division of ST</ENAMEX> may result from the presence of stromal and
        absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ST signaling</ENAMEX>.
        However, perpendicular orientation of dividing
        trophoblast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in vivo cannot be achieved in vitro,
        because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex villous structure</ENAMEX>, and the villous core
        in particular, is absent. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> > ERÎ² transition
        was also observed during trophoblast differentiation in
        culture, the cultured trophoblast cells are expected to
        undergo symmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> toward the differentiated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> rather than asymmetric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. Indeed, early
        cultures show proliferating CT cells, which are gradually
        transformed into the differentiating CT cells and syncytial
        aggregates during the culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , possibly due to the
        prevalence of differentiation signals in the absence of
        stromal signaling (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11C</NUMEX>). This view is supported by
        gradual diminution of promitotic cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> and an increase
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antimitotic p27 proteins</ENAMEX> during trophoblast culture
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Finally, regarding the placenta, it is important
        to consider the stage of pregnancy. For early pregnancy,
        the scheme in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10can</NUMEX> possibly be extended to other
        cell types (decidua, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVT</ENAMEX>), in contrast to the term placenta
        where only villous CT cells are dividing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        We recently showed that exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2</ENAMEX> markedly stimulates
        development of large syncytial aggregates in trophoblast
        cultures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . We also observed that this effect can be
        abolished with pure anti-estrogen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICI 182,780</NUMEX> (unpublished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>). These data indicate that trophoblast differentiation
        is estrogen-dependent. Since trophoblast differentiation is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with transition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> expression, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporary</ENAMEX> co-expression of both, one may assume that both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> are involved in estrogen stimulated trophoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. Since production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placental hormones</ENAMEX> is
        characteristic of mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">syncytium</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 9 11 53 54</NUMEX> ] , which
        shows in vivo cytoplasmic ERÎ² expression only, one may also
        assume that estrogens stimulate production of placental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST.</ENAMEX>
        Studies on localization and expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> hormone
        binding domain recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E12 and F12</TIMEX> monoclonal
        antibodies in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placenta</ENAMEX> are of particular interest.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunohistochemical</ENAMEX> studies with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> by Choi
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] revealed nuclear-specific localization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² protein</ENAMEX> in granulosa cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat ovary</ENAMEX> and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelial</ENAMEX> and some stromal cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epididymis</ENAMEX>. Specificity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E12 and F12</TIMEX> monoclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> was verified by western blot analysis using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baculovirus</ENAMEX> expressed form of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">53 kDa</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were also reported to identify an
        additional ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62-64</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> from
        granulosa cells of several mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, in addition
        to the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Our observations on human placenta show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E12</ENAMEX> and F12
        antibodies exhibit nuclear-specific reactivity with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placental ST. Therefore</ENAMEX>, cytoplasmic reactivity in mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, which recognizes a
        single ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, might not be related to the ERÎ²
        variant with a hormone binding domain. Indeed, in human
        trophoblast cultures, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E12</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibodies</ENAMEX> are shown
        to exhibit virtually no reactivity with the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa variant
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> shows no reactivity at ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa</ENAMEX>. Therefore, one may speculate that the placental ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa ERÎ²</ENAMEX> variant is not necessarily a hormone binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may also assume that the placental ERÎ² hormone
        binding variant recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E12</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibodies</ENAMEX> does
        not contain or expose epitopes which are recognized by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-19 ERÎ²</ENAMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> which shows reactivity with
        trophoblast cultures. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E12</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibodies</ENAMEX> have been
        shown to react with baculovirus expressed ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> kDa form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human ERÎ²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Yet, it is possible that
        mammalian cells naturally expressing ERÎ² produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein variants</ENAMEX>, with and without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² hormone</ENAMEX> binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, resulting from (post-) translational modifications
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, villous cytotrophoblast cells merging
        with syncytium showed nuclear-specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F12</TIMEX>, but not E12
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX>. Hence, the epitope associated with the
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> kDa ERÎ² hormone binding variant recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E12</TIMEX> and
        F12 can be excluded, but the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> kDa variant recognized by
        F12 might be considered to be involved in early trophoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibody</ENAMEX> also failed to
        recognize a distinct ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in human granulosa cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein extracts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E12 antibody</ENAMEX> did not show
        any reactivity at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~68 kDa</NUMEX>, one may speculate that the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>
        kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> might be another ERÎ² <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein variant</ENAMEX>. Indeed, it
        has been indicated that it is unlikely that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E12</NUMEX> and F12
        antibodies recognize exactly the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the epitope
        since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibody</ENAMEX> was much more efficient in
        immunoprecipitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native ERÎ² protein</ENAMEX> generated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . We also show that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E12 antibody</ENAMEX> identifies
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">~56</ENAMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in trophoblast cultures barely visible in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extracts</ENAMEX> analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">F12 antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B).
        Nevertheless, as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> and time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> protein
        extracts, trophoblast differentiation in early and late
        tissue cultures was associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> fold
        increase of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² hormone binding variant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        8C), while the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> showed a tendency to decline in late
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A). Therefore, the ERÎ² hormone binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> appears to play a dominant role in the
        hormone-stimulated terminal differentiation of trophoblast,
        while the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² protein</ENAMEX> might be somehow related to
        the non-hormonal regulation of early stages of trophoblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> (see proposed role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> in asymmetric
        division of estrogen-dependent cells discussed above). The
        importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² hormone binding variants</ENAMEX> in stimulation
        of terminal trophoblast differentiation is supported by our
        observation on the stimulatory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2</ENAMEX> for the
        formation of large syncytial aggregates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        From the above it appears that in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placenta</ENAMEX>, there
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERÎ² proteins</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the cytoplasmic and
        nuclear ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> kDa ERÎ² with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal related epitopes
        recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and lacking a
        hormone binding domain recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E12</TIMEX> and F12
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the nuclear-specific ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> kDa ERÎ² with a
        hormone binding domain recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E12 and F12</TIMEX> antibodies
        and lacking epitopes recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> polyclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The existence of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct ERÎ² proteins
        is particularly supported by their different expression in
        trophoblast cultures (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8Aand 8B</ENAMEX>). A
        possibility exists that there is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional ~68</NUMEX> kDa ERÎ²
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is recognized exclusively by the F12
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">8B</ENAMEX>) and expressed in the nuclei of
        early differentiating trophoblast cells merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
      
      
        Conclusion
        In conclusion, our observations concur with recent views
        on the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> in the proliferation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> in
        the maturation of estrogen-dependent cells. Asymmetric
        segregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ±</ENAMEX> in dividing villous CT cells,
        accompanied by appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> in differentiating
        daughter cells, suggests a unique role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> in asymmetric
        division of estrogen-dependent cells. Significantly
        enhanced expression of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> kDa ERÎ² hormone binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX> in differentiating trophoblast cells and
        stimulation of trophoblast differentiation by estrogens
        indicates a unique role of the ERÎ² hormone binding domain
        in the regulation of placental function. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> is a
        major source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">placental hormones</ENAMEX>, which ensure optimal
        conditions for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERÎ²</ENAMEX> expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>
        may be involved in stimulation of placental hormonal
        production by estrogens.
