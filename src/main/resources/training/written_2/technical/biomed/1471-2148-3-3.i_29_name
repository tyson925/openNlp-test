        Epistatic interactions between mutations in different
        genes, or different sites within the same gene, can
        substantially influence the dynamics of evolving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Although adaptation by natural selection
        depends on occasional beneficial mutations, in fact most
        mutations are neutral or deleterious. Therefore, if
        mutations are randomly added to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s genome (as
        opposed to incorporated by natural selection), then fitness
        tends to decline with mutation number. Mutations whose
        effects are independent of one another are termed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplicative</ENAMEX> . If mutations
        interact so that their combined effect on fitness is
        greater than expected from their individual effects, then
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epistasis</ENAMEX> is said to be 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synergistic</ENAMEX> . For deleterious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, synergistic epistasis means that the decline in
        average fitness accelerates as more random mutations are
        added (such epistasis is termed 
        negative by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ).
        By contrast, if deleterious mutations interact so that
        their combined effect is smaller than expected under the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplicative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, then epistasis is called 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonistic</ENAMEX> (or 
        positive in the terminology of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips et al.</ENAMEX>). Antagonistic epistasis therefore implies
        unexpected robustness to the effects of multiple
        deleterious mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The predicted effects of these various types of
        mutational interactions on population dynamics are well
        studied (for reviews, see [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] ), but in most models
        the types of interactions are ad hoc because it is not
        known how well the assumed interactions reflect reality. In
        particular, the question of what kinds of interactions are
        typical, and under what conditions, is addressed only
        rarely.
        Recent work has shown that epistatic interactions can be
        interpreted as curvature in the fitness surface [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ,
        which implies that geometry imposes limitations on the
        types of epistasis that can be observed for any given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX>. Closely related to this geometric approach is the
        realization that epistasis must be studied with respect to
        a particular reference sequence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] , and that
        the forms of epistatic interactions change when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> is changed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adami</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] proposed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhomogeneities</ENAMEX> in the distribution of genotypes give rise
        to directional epistasis (directional epistasis is the net
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epistasis</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over many</NUMEX> pairs of mutations) among
        deleterious mutations, and that the sign of directional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epistasis</ENAMEX> provides information about the density gradient
        of high-fitness sequences within a cluster. Hence,
        evolutionary hypotheses that depend crucially on the sign
        of epistasis, including certain theories on the evolution
        of recombination [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] and on the speed of
        mutation accumulation in asexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] ,
        will also depend on the density distribution of fit
        genotypes, and on the topology of those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of genotype
        space into which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> move under the pressures of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and selection.
        The argument relating directional epistasis to the
        distribution of high-fitness sequences within a cluster of
        fit sequences goes as follows (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Consider a
        sequence that lies near the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of a dense cluster of
        high-fitness sequences. Such a sequence is surrounded by
        many other high-fitness genotypes, and the average harm
        done by a single mutation is therefore relatively low. But
        as more random mutations are added, high-fitness genotypes
        become less common, and the average harm of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> is stronger than what the effect of single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> indicated. This increasingly harmful effect of
        mutations at greater distances away from the original
        sequence corresponds to 
        synergistic epistasis. By contrast,
        if a sequence is located at the periphery of a high-fitness
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>, or in a region of low density of high-fitness
        sequences, then this synergistic tendency is lessened, and
        we might even observe antagonistic epistasis for this
        sequence. One prediction of this hypothesis of density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhomogeneities</ENAMEX> is that the average fitness effect of
        single mutations must be correlated with the strength and
        direction of epistatic interactions at larger mutational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. This prediction was confirmed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> secondary
        structure folding and in digital organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . A
        similar effect was observed for quantitative trait loci in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        While the hypothesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adami</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] explains
        some of the variation within the observed range of
        epistatic interactions, it fails to predict whether we
        should always expect an excess of synergistic epistasis, or
        whether antagonistic interactions might dominate in certain
        situations. Recent experiments indicate that synergistic
        and antagonistic interactions are both common when pairs of
        mutations are considered, but that, overall, the two types
        of interactions either roughly cancel each other out or
        perhaps even produce an excess of antagonistic interactions
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> study of this
        type reported an excess of synergistic interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        . Moreover, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> simple systems with computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landscapes</ENAMEX>, self-replicating computer programs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> secondary structure folding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , both exhibited a
        clear excess of antagonistic interactions.
        What factors may explain a tendency toward antagonism?
        Here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> possible explanations, and there may be
        others:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Biased recovery: In some experimental systems, it is
        difficult to isolate genotypes with very low fitness,
        including non-viable ones. By allowing random mutations to
        accumulate only in surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lineages</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> may
        inadvertently bound mean fitness away from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, and
        thereby bias the shape of the fitness function versus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mutation</ENAMEX> number from synergy toward antagonism.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Multiple hits: To the extent that multiple mutations
        hit the same gene or pathway, subsequent mutations will
        more likely be neutral than initial ones, because the same
        function cannot be destroyed twice. In effect, one mutation
        may convert <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into pseudo-genes, or junk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, in which subsequent mutations have no further harmful
        effect.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Intrinsic or evolved form of interaction: The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of metabolic pathways and gene regulation might be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inherently</ENAMEX> structured to produce more antagonistic than
        synergistic interactions. Even if there is no necessary
        biochemical tendency in this direction, it is possible that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> and their regulation have evolved to promote such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. While this explanation is vague, a failure to
        identify any other explanation for observed patterns of
        mutational interaction would suggest a closer examination
        of models of metabolic pathways and gene regulation with
        this issue in mind.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Compensatory mutation: Consider a genotype that is on
        a peak (or plateau) in a fitness landscape, such that all
        mutations are either deleterious or neutral. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> moves
        away from this genotype by adding mutations, imagine that
        the ratio of deleterious to neutral mutations stays
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>, as does the average effect of a deleterious
        mutation. But as the distance away from this peak
        increases, a portion of the mutant distribution may move
        into the vicinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> other fitness peaks,
        separated from the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by a valley of deleterious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. Mutations that lead out of the valley onto a new
        fitness peak are, of course, beneficial mutations. If a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> is beneficial because it restores some previously
        existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or function, then we can call it a
        compensatory mutation. If the frequency of compensatory
        mutations increases as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> moves out from the original
        peak, this effect will slow down the decay of mean fitness
        with increasing mutational distance, even without 
        selection for compensatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we focus on a fairly simple system (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        secondary structure folding), which avoids the first
        explanation above because of complete information, and
        avoids the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> explanations because there is
        only a single gene with dichotomous fitness (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX>) in the
        system. Thus, we can focus on whether, and to what extent,
        compensatory mutations that precisely restore the
        previously existing folding structure contribute to an
        excess of antagonistic interactions.
        In order to analyze the topology and structure of
        fitness landscapes, and assess their effect on epistasis,
        we need a system where each sequence in a well-defined
        space is assigned a unique fitness that is independent of
        the frequency of other genotypes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        secondary structure folding is a well-studied model system.
        In this system, the secondary structure of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecule
        is taken as a predictor of the fitness of the underlying
        sequence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA folding</ENAMEX> has the
        advantage that all genotypes can be separated naturally
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> classes, the viable ones (those that fold
        into a particular target structure) with fitness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and the
        non-viable ones (those that fail to fold into that exact
        structure), which are assigned fitness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. Such a
        classification permits a precise mathematical analysis,
        while at the same time many important properties of
        high-dimensional fitness landscapes are retained [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
        The set of all viable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> can be decomposed into
        smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> called neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> viable
        sequences belong to the same neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> if one
        sequence can be transformed into the other through a series
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX> point mutations, without passing through a
        sequence with lower fitness along the way. If no such
        series of mutations exists, then the two viable sequences
        belong to different neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
        As discussed in previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 11 25</ENAMEX> ] , the
        average fitness 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) at a Hamming distance 
        d from a particular reference
        sequence can be used for studying directional epistasis in
        a large number of genotypes. The value of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) is obtained by averaging over the
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fitnesses</ENAMEX> of all sequences that can be obtained
        from the reference sequence by introducing 
        d mutations. By definition, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>) is the fitness of the reference
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and we have always 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The value of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) is given by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> minus the mean
        effect of single mutations and, in general, the value of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) is given by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> minus the mean
        effect of 
        d mutations. Moreover, since we
        assume in this study that all individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fitnesses</ENAMEX> are
        either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) corresponds also to the fraction
        of viable sequences at distance 
        d from the reference sequence. We
        will make use of this property repeatedly throughout this
        paper.
        We expect that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) decreases roughly exponentially
        as 
        d increases, for the following
        reason. If the sequences are sufficiently long that any
        back mutations can be neglected, then genotype space can be
        visualized as a tree (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). If the number of neutral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neighbors</ENAMEX> (the neutrality, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î½</ENAMEX>) of all viable sequences is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same</TIMEX>, and the fraction of neutral
        mutations of a viable sequence is on average much larger
        than the probability that a completely random sequence is
        viable, then 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) can be approximated by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">[Î½</ENAMEX>/( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L Îº-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> )] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> is sequence length and Îº denotes
        the number of different bases that can occur (Îº = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>). Thus, we can write 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exp</ENAMEX>(-Î± 
        d ) with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î±</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - Î½/</ENAMEX>( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L Îº-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ). The condition that the fraction
        of neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mutants Î½</ENAMEX>/( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L Îº-</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ) is much larger than the total
        fraction of viable mutants among all possible sequences is
        crucial for the exponential decay of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). Consider by contrast the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Roulette</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gavrilets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gravner</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , in which
        all sequences are randomly assigned a fitness value of
        either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The total fraction 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> of viable sequences in this model
        is equal to the expected fraction of neutral mutants of any
        sequence with fitness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) â‰ˆ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> for 
        d <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0</NUMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
        In the general case, Î½ is not constant. If Î½ changes
        systematically with increasing 
        d , then 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) will decay slightly faster or
        slower than a perfect exponential. We incorporate this by
        writing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exp</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-Î±d Î²</ENAMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        The parameter Î² represents the 
        deviation from the exponential
        expectation. Because an exact exponential decay means that
        the average effect of a new mutation is independent of how
        many mutations have accumulated previously, Î² is a measure
        of the net effect of epistatic interactions. In the
        following, we refer to this net effect as directional
        epistasis, and to Î² as the epistasis parameter. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î² > 1</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to synergistic epistasis, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î² < 1</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to antagonistic interactions.
        Consider the fitness landscape depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, in
        which circles represent viable sequences while crosses are
        non-viable ones. This particular landscape contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX>
        separate neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (indicated by bold
        solid lines) is connected to the reference sequence at
        distance 
        d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. At 
        d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>, a
        compensatory mutation leads onto a second neutral network
        (shown as bold dashed lines). For such "fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>"
        anchored at particular reference sequences, we can measure
        both the decline in average fitness with mutational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), as well as the change in the
        average neutrality as we increase 
        d . The average neutrality at
        distance 
        d simply reflects the connectedness
        of the neutral network at that distance. Average neutrality
        at mutational distance 
        d is defined as the average number of
        neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of a sequence that is separated by 
        d mutations from the reference
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and that is part of the neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> under
        investigation. As per the arguments by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adami</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        ] , we expect the connectedness to decrease with 
        d as we move away from a reference
        sequence in the center of a high-fitness cluster. By
        contrast, we expect connectedness to increase (or at least
        decrease more slowly) if the reference sequence is on the
        fringe of such a cluster. Figure 3shows 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) and average neutrality for
        examples of "fringe" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>" reference sequences. The
        fringe sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a) has strongly antagonistic net
        epistasis, and neutrality increases with distance. By
        contrast, the center sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b) shows a slightly
        synergistic tendency and declining neutrality with
        distance. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> agrees with our expectation that
        more antagonistic curves 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) are caused by an increase in the
        density of neutral sequences with 
        d , whereas more synergistic curves
        result from a corresponding decline.
      
      
        Results
        For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> randomly chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sequences of length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>, we measured both the fraction
        of neutral mutants 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) as well as the average neutrality
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> of neutral mutants as a function of the
        distance 
        d . We determined Î± and Î² from
        fitting exp(-Î± 
        d Î²) to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). Moreover, we performed a linear
        regression on the average neutrality to quantify the change
        in neutrality with distance from the reference sequence,
        for each of the random sequences serving as a reference.
        Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> reference sequences that we studied, the
        change in neutrality was sufficiently linear to make the
        slope 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> an excellent indicator of the
        general trend (increasing or decreasing neutrality with
        distance 
        d ), even if the true relationship
        was not always precisely linear.
        Figure 4shows this measured slope 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> versus the fitted epistasis
        parameter Î² for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> reference sequences. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quantities are very strongly correlated (correlation
        coefficient 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.960</NUMEX>, 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). However, the
        distributions of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m and Î²</ENAMEX> differ in an important
        respect. The values of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> are distributed roughly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symmetrically</ENAMEX> around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, meaning that the average
        neutrality increases as often as it decreases with distance
        from the reference sequence. The epistasis parameter Î², on
        the other hand, lies almost entirely below unity. Even when
        the average neutrality decays quickly as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> moves away
        from the reference sequence, the corresponding value of Î²
        indicates at most a very slight tendency toward synergistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epistasis</ENAMEX>. This is precisely the pattern of excess
        antagonistic epistasis that demands an explanation.
        If compensatory mutations were responsible for the shift
        of Î² to values below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, then by adjusting the function 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) to 
        remove their contribution we should
        find a distribution of Î² symmetrical around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. As
        described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section, it is possible to
        separate the contribution to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) of neutral mutations that lie on
        the same network 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) from the contribution 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) that reflects compensatory
        mutations from neighboring neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> onto the
        reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Figure 5shows 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), estimated using method <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M2</TIMEX>, for a
        typical example. The contribution of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) dwindles as the mutational
        distance 
        d increases, while 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) becomes increasingly dominant. In
        other words, at large distances 
        d , most of the viable sequences
        arise through compensatory mutations.
        After partitioning the contributions of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> functions 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), we determined Î± and Î² for the
        functions 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) in the same way as was done for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). The functions 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) can be thought of as the decay
        functions without "contamination" by compensatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. Thus, the differences in Î± and Î² for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) must be ascribed to compensatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6shows Î±</TIMEX> versus Î² for both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), shown as triangles, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), calculated by method <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M2</TIMEX>, shown
        as circles. The removal of compensatory mutations causes a
        pronounced upward shift of Î² toward more synergistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epistasis</ENAMEX>. The average decay parameter Î± is largely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unaffected</ENAMEX>. For 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), average <Î²> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.893</NUMEX> Â±
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.006</NUMEX> (standard error of the mean), while for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) the average <Î²> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.983</NUMEX> Â±
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.004 by M2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.046 Â± 0.005</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M1</TIMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7shows</TIMEX> that the
        removal of compensatory mutations yields a distribution of
        Î² that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> symmetric around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, in contrast
        to the pronounced excess of antagonistic epistasis (Î² <
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) when compensatory mutations are included.
      
      
        Discussion
        The correlation between average mutational effects (Î±)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">directional epistasis (Î²</ENAMEX>) described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilke</ENAMEX> and Adami
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] implies that whether a reference sequence shows
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synergistic</ENAMEX> or antagonistic epistasis depends on whether it
        lies near the center of a dense cluster of high-fitness
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in genetic space, or on the fringes of such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hansen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagner</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] independently suggested
        that the relative frequency of synergistic and antagonistic
        interactions depends on the distance of the genotype in
        question from the optimum, and thus from the center of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>.
        In this study, we demonstrated a very strong correlation
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between Î²</TIMEX>, which governs the net direction of epistasis,
        and the mean change in neutrality per added mutation away
        from the reference sequence, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This correlation is fully
        consistent with the hypothesis that directional epistasis
        depends on the location of the reference sequence relative
        to other high-fitness genotypes. Yet, this correlation does
        not explain the overall preponderance of antagonistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">epistasis</ENAMEX> observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> computational systems [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 11</ENAMEX> ] ,
        nor the absence of overall synergistic epistasis in most
        biological systems that have been carefully studied in this
        regard. Although we found wide variation in the epistasis
        parameter for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> secondary structure folding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> reference sequences showed an excess of antagonistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">epistasis (Î² < 1</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> exhibited more synergism (Î²
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">> 1</ENAMEX>). We demonstrated that this overall excess of
        antagonistic interactions results from compensatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>), which are evidently important
        for the shape of the fitness function whether or not a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is in the middle of a dense cluster.
        The trajectory for mean fitness as random mutations
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accumulate</ENAMEX> is generally one of decay because many more
        mutations are deleterious than are beneficial. The decay
        function is therefore sometimes loosely discussed as if it
        depended only on deleterious mutations (or only deleterious
        and neutral mutations). This focus on declining fitness
        tends to ignore compensatory mutations because they are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX>, albeit conditionally. But compensatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> cannot be ignored if their frequency varies
        systematically in genetic space. In particular, if
        compensatory mutations are an increasing fraction of all
        viable mutations as the distribution moves away from a
        local fitness peak, then they will affect the shape of the
        decay function (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) and the resulting epistasis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 6, 7</ENAMEX>).
        In the present paper, we have used the term
        "compensatory mutation" for all mutations that are not on
        the main neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, irrespective of their distance to
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. This is a broad definition of compensatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, because it encompasses not only those mutations
        that directly counteract a particular deleterious mutation,
        but also mutations that establish a new neutral network far
        away from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. The latter type of mutations
        could also be called advantageous mutations. Here, we have
        lumped both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> together, because in this way the
        presentation of our results is less cluttered, and the
        mathematics of separating 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) into the various contributions is
        easier to follow, than if we were distinguishing three
        different types of mutations. An additional argument for
        calling all these mutations compensatory is that they can
        produce a fitness gain only in association with one or more
        mutations that would otherwise be deleterious, that is,
        none of the mutations that could be termed advantageous is
        accessible directly from the main neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. On the
        other hand, our definition excludes mutations that restore
        a genotype to the main neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> (even mutations that
        are not reversions in the strict sense). Again, we chose
        this definition for mathematical precision and clarity. The
        definition is not as important as the substantive
        conclusion: The fact that it is possible to restore a
        previously existing structure by many non-trivial
        mutational pathways is sufficient to cause pronounced
        antagonistic directional epistasis.
        A high abundance of compensatory mutations implies
        considerable flexibility in the genotype-phenotype map,
        such that fit phenotypes can be found widely distributed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">genotype</ENAMEX> space. For the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> secondary structure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">folding</ENAMEX>, this property of the genotype-phenotype map has
        been demonstrated analytically using graph theory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ,
        and it has been verified in extensive numerical simulations
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX> graph theory predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> secondary
        structures can be classified into common structures, which
        can be found almost anywhere in sequence space, and rare
        structures. Only a very small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> fold into
        any given rare structure. The common structures satisfy the
        shape-covering theorem, which states that within any sphere
        of a certain radius 
        r , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> sequence can be
        found that folds into a given common structure. Since we
        have chosen the reference sequences randomly in our
        analysis, we can safely assume that the majority of the
        sequences that we have studied fold into a common
        structure, and that therefore the shape-covering theorem
        applies. For sequences of length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>, we have 
        r â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 10</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ).
        That means that any common structure can be found at least
        once within a distance of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-12</NUMEX> mutations
        from any arbitrarily chosen sequence. In other words, even
        in the empty regions of sequence space, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> out of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 6-10</NUMEX> 7sequences will be viable. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> prediction from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> graph theory is that the common <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> should
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">percolate</ENAMEX> through sequence space. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Percolation</ENAMEX> means that it
        is possible to find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences with almost no sequence
        identity which fold into the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, and which are
        connected by a path of mutant sequences that also fold into
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. However, this percolation property
        holds only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of a pair in
        paired regions of the secondary structure is considered as
        a single-mutation event, which runs counter to the standard
        biological meaning of mutation. Most of these double
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> will be classified as compensatory mutations
        according to our definition (because each individual
        mutation of such pairs will most likely destroy the
        secondary structure), and therefore a single neutral path
        according to random graph theory will appear as several
        independent paths linked together by compensatory mutations
        in our analysis. This fact, combined with the
        shape-covering theorem which we discussed previously, is
        probably the source of the large number of compensatory
        mutations that we observe.
        A major difference between the fitness landscapes we
        have studied here and more natural fitness landscapes is
        that we restricted fitness values to either one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>,
        whereas in nature fitness is certainly not a binary
        variable. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sequences that fold into the same structure
        may bind to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> with different efficiencies, and a
        sequence that folds into a slightly different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may
        also bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, albeit less efficiently. We
        chose here binary fitness values for mathematical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplicity</ENAMEX> and clarity in our analysis. With a continuous
        fitness scale, apart from neutral and inviable sequences,
        we would have to keep track of slightly and strongly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deleterious</ENAMEX> as well as advantageous sequences, and would
        consequently need a much more elaborate mathematical
        procedure to account for the contributions from these
        different fitness classes. Nevertheless, it would certainly
        be desirable to address in a future study the effect of
        compensatory mutations on epistatic interactions in a
        system with a continuous fitness scale, for example with a
        fitness measure similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancel</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontana</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] or, alternatively, using digital organisms [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] .
        The present study does not exclude the possibility that
        antagonistic epistasis in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> could be caused by
        effects other than compensatory mutations. However, our
        findings do indicate that compensatory mutations can play a
        major role in producing antagonistic epistasis and thus
        slowing the decay in mean fitness under random mutation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>. Moreover, in the present study, only
        mutations that re-created exactly the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA folding</ENAMEX> as
        the wild-type were deemed compensatory, while in nature
        even a modified secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may have a tertiary
        structure that is sufficiently close to the wild-type that
        no fitness loss is incurred [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , which means that
        compensatory mutations in natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> may be
        even more frequent that in our computational model.
        Compensatory mutations have been reported for rRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tRNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , and mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] structures, and it is
        certainly not surprising that we should find a high
        frequency of compensatory mutations in the present study.
        What is important and novel in this study is that we have
        explained the overall excess of antagonistic epistasis by
        these compensatory mutations. This connection suggests that
        evidence for one of these phenomena may provide evidence
        for the other in more complicated systems.
        In the remaining paragraphs, we discuss to what extent
        our results can be applied to systems other than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        secondary structure folding. We begin with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Several studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> folding 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">silico</TIMEX> indicate that widespread
        neutral networks exist, comparable to the situation for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, decay functions similar
        to the function 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) studied here have been measured 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52</NUMEX> ] by making fitness
        a binary variable (e.g., a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binds to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> or
        not) and then screening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of sequences with varying
        average numbers of mutations for the relevant property.
        These experiments found that average fitness initially
        decayed exponentially with increasing mutations, but the
        rate of decay tended to decelerate at higher mutation
        numbers. This deceleration may be attributed to suppressor
        mutations that stabilize parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> against
        further mutations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] , which in essence is a form of
        compensation. For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the M182T</TIMEX> mutation in
        Î²-lactamase compensates for locally destabilizing mutations
        in a loop near the active site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . Unfortunately,
        no study has yet investigated explicitly the decay function
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that carry such a suppressor mutation.
        Therefore, it is unclear whether the decelerating decay
        rates seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daugherty et</ENAMEX> al.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] are a consequence of compensatory suppressor
        mutations or, alternatively, indicate that the reference
        sequences happened to be located outside a dense cluster of
        fit sequences.
        Using whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and viruses, several studies have
        sought to measure the mutational decay function for fitness
        and the overall direction of epistatic interactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 56</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of these studies found net
        synergistic interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . Several other studies
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and viruses have documented widespread
        compensatory mutations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58 59</NUMEX> ] , although these
        studies all used selection to find compensatory mutations
        rather than directly estimating their frequency. Taken
        together, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of studies are largely consistent
        with the main conclusions of the present paper, that
        synergistic interactions do not generally dominate the
        fitness function and compensatory mutations are common.
        Moreover, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the studies on compensation, it was
        shown that the compensatory mutations had occurred outside
        the gene that was debilitated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, the
        observed patterns of epistasis and compensation do not
        merely reflect the robustness of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and protein
        molecules to multiple mutations (as described above), but
        must indicate more general features of their genomes.
        Of course, it is possible that more complex patterns of
        gene regulation in eukaryotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] might predispose them
        to synergistic effects between mutations. In fact, studies
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruitflies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 61</NUMEX> ] and a unicellular alga [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] (but
        see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ) reported net synergistic epistasis, which
        might reflect fitness landscapes in which peaks are few and
        far between. But other studies with eukaryotes, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and fungi [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 29</NUMEX> ] , found no tendency
        toward synergistic epistasis. Hence, the overall direction
        of epistasis for fitness, and the possible role of
        compensatory mutations in pushing toward net antagonistic
        epistasis among random mutations, will require more study
        in higher organisms. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zuckerkandl</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] recently
        proposed that complex regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> may often evolve
        via a process of drift decay followed by selection for
        compensatory mutations. Such an interplay would complicate
        the overall pattern of directional epistasis relative to
        regulatory complexity.
      
      
        Methods
        We predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> secondary structure using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> package, version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3.1</NUMEX>, with the default set-up [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ]
        . We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> randomly chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sequences of length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> as reference sequences, by
        randomly drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, C, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> from a uniform
        distribution in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">base</ENAMEX> has a probability <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> of
        being drawn at any position. For each reference sequence,
        we determined its secondary structure, and measured the
        fraction of mutant sequences at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamming</ENAMEX> distances 
        d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,...,8</NUMEX> that folded into the
        same structure, by calculating the secondary structure of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 10</NUMEX> 6mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> at each Hamming distance. We
        used the fraction of neutral mutants at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamming</ENAMEX> distance 
        d as the function 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) for the particular reference
        sequence. (The fraction of neutral mutants at distance 
        d is equivalent to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) under the assumption that mutant
        sequences which fold into the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> as the
        reference sequence have fitness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and all other mutants
        have fitness <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>.) In addition, to distinguish neutral from
        compensatory mutations, we recorded at each Hamming
        distance 
        d , for all viable sequences as well
        as a random sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1,000</NUMEX> non-viable sequences, the
        average number of viable sequences after an 
        additional one-step mutation. In the
        following analyses, we denote the average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
        viable sequences that are one mutation away from a viable
        sequence at distance 
        d as 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). Similarly, we denote as 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) the average fraction of viable
        sequences that are one mutation away from a 
        non-viable sequence at distance 
        d .
        As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , we fitted functions exp(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-Î±d Î²</ENAMEX>) to
        the measured 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), in order to obtain a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-parameter description of the average effect of single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations, Î±</ENAMEX>, and the directional epistasis, Î². We also
        fitted functions 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">md</ENAMEX> + 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> to the average neutrality as a
        function of 
        d , in order to identify whether
        neutrality was increasing or decreasing with mutational
        distance 
        d .
        We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods to separate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) into contributions from viable
        sequences that lie on the same neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> as the
        reference sequence at 
        d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> [ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d )], and from viable sequences that
        lie on other neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d )].
        The first method, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M1</TIMEX>, uses the information contained in
        both 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) and 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). As explained below, this method
        tends to overestimate the contribution of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). Let Î³ ( 
        d ) = 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d )/ [ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) + 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d )], which is the fraction of viable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> belonging to the reference neutral network at
        distance 
        d . Then, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) is simply given by
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î³</NUMEX> ( 
        d ) 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
        Estimating 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) is more complicated. First, we
        must take into account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> contributing to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) that are not part of the neutral
        network of the reference sequence. This contribution is
        given by [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 - Î³</NUMEX> ( 
        d )] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). We must then obtain the
        contribution of additional compensatory mutations at
        distance 
        d + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. These are given by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), the number of non-viable
        sequences at distance 
        d , multiplied by the probability
        with which these non-viables turn into viable sequences
        after a single mutation, 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). Hence, we arrive at
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) = [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 - Î³</NUMEX> ( 
        d )] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) + [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d )] 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
        With relations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), we can recursively calculate
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) for all 
        d for which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) and 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) are known.
        In general, we expect 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) â‰ˆ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) + 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). However, method M1 has the
        problem that some of the mutations counted in 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) may actually lead back onto the
        network of the reference sequence rather than onto a
        separate neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. (While this can be seen as a sort
        of compensatory mutation, it is not the kind investigated
        here.) Such sequences would then be counted twice, so that
        in reality 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) < 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) + 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ).
        To avoid this double-counting, method <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M2</ENAMEX> uses instead of
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the expression
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) = 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
        In this case, the quantity 
        x 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) drops out, which insures that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) + 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) is always identical to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). M2 does not suffer from double
        counting viable sequences, but it uses less information
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M1</TIMEX> and depends on an additional assumption. In
        particular, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M2</TIMEX> assumes that the viable sequences at
        distance 
        d that belong to the neutral network
        of the reference sequence have the same neutrality as those
        that do not belong to that network. Given these
        considerations, it seems prudent to use both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">M1</ENAMEX> and M2
        rather than rely entirely on either one.
        Both methods <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M1 and M2</TIMEX> are based on the assumption that
        the fitness landscape can be represented as a tree, and
        that back mutations can be neglected. With a sequence
        length of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">228</NUMEX> possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> is a back mutation, and therefore the neglect of
        back mutations is justified. The representation of the
        fitness landscape as a tree is potentially more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">problematic</ENAMEX>, because there may exist several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> from the
        reference sequence to a particular sequence at mutational
        distance 
        d , whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> approximation
        assumes that there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> such path. For example,
        consider the wild type aa, with neutral mutants aA, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aa</ENAMEX>, and
        AA, Then, at mutational distance one, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neutral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> (aA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aa</ENAMEX>), and at distance <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, there is only one
        (AA). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> approximation counts the mutant at distance
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two twice</NUMEX>, once as a mutant of aA, and once as a mutant of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aa</ENAMEX>. This double counting means that our methods have the
        tendency to overestimate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). This overestimation, however, is
        not problematic in the context of the present paper,
        because - as we emphasized in the results - our main
        conclusions are based on the large contribution of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ). A correction for the
        overestimation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neut</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ) would increase the contribution
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comp</ENAMEX> ( 
        d ), and would therefore make our
        conclusions even stronger.
