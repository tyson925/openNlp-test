        The complete sequencing of several genomes, including
        that of the human, has signaled the beginning of a new era
        in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are becoming increasingly interested in
        functional genomics; that is, uncovering both the
        functional roles of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and how these genes
        interact with, and/or influence, each other. Increasingly,
        this question is being addressed through the simultaneous
        analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of unique genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> with microarrays. Already, analytical strategies
        have subdivided into distinct 'omic' domains, such as
        genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This enables
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to examine not only genetic elements, but also
        the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolites</ENAMEX> derived from
        these genes. All 'omic' technologies share the need for
        fresh, innovative looks at data analysis. To date,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptomics</ENAMEX> is the most widely studied molecular
        approach, enabling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to examine subtle
        differences in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of mRNA levels between
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, medical biopsies, 
        etc . Although mRNA is not the end
        product of a gene, the transcription of a gene is both
        critical and highly regulated, thereby providing an ideal
        point of investigation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Development of microarrays
        has permitted global measurement of gene expression at the
        transcript level and provided a glimpse into the
        coordinated control and interactions between genes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presently</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> technologies dominate the field of
        high-density microarrays: cDNA arrays and oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. The cDNA array has a long history of development [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] stemming from immunodiagnostic work in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>;
        however, it has been most widely developed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> depositing
        cDNA tags onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides, or chips, with precise robotic
        printers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Labeled cDNA fragments are then hybridized
        to the tags on the chip, scanned, and differences in mRNA
        between samples identified and visualized using a variation
        of the red/green matrix originally introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eisen</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The light-generated oligonucleotide
        array, developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, CA),
        involves synthesizing short <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-mer oligonucleotide probes
        directly onto a glass slide using photolithographic masks [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Sample processing includes the production of
        labeled cRNA, hybridization to a microarray, and
        quantification of the obtained signal after laser scanning.
        Regardless of the array used, the output can be readily
        transferred to commercially available data analysis
        programs for the selection and clustering of significantly
        modified genes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes will be defined herein as
        gene data determined to be statistical outliers from some
        standard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and which can not be ascribed to chance or
        natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variabilty</ENAMEX>. Various creative techniques have been
        proposed and implemented for the selection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes; however, none have yet
        gained widespread acceptance for microarray analysis.
        Despite this, there remains a great impulse to develop new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> analysis techniques, partly driven by the obvious need
        to move beyond setting simple fold change cut-offs which
        are out of context with the rest of the experimental and
        biological data at hand [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . This has been the
        case for many studies, where the selection of differential
        gene expression is performed through a simple fold change
        cut-off, typically <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 1.8 and 3.0</NUMEX>. There is an
        inherent problem with this selection criterion, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of
        low absolute expression have a greater inherent error in
        their measured levels. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will then tend to
        numerically meet any given fold change cut-off even if the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is not truly differentially expressed. The inverse
        also holds true, where highly expressed genes, having less
        error in their measured levels, may not meet an arbitrary
        fold-change cut-off of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> even when they are truly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, selecting
        differentially regulated genes based only on a single fold
        change across the entire range of experimental data
        preferentially selects lowly expressed genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This
        commonly used approach does not accommodate for background
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noise</ENAMEX>, variability, non-specific binding, or low copy
        numbers- characteristics typical of microarray data which
        may not be homogeneously distributed. Other approaches
        entail the use of standard statistical measures such as a
        student's 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test or ANOVA for every individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. However, due to the cost of repeating microarray
        experiments, the number of replicates usually remains low,
        leading to inaccurate estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variance</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, due to the low number of replicates, the power
        of these "gene-by-gene" statistical tests to differentiate
        between regulated and non-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also remains very
        low.
        The present article describes a model that considers
        both expression levels and fold changes for the
        identification of significant differentially expressed
        genes. This simple model allows the experimenter to
        estimate the relationship between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters in
        the absence of large numbers of experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replicates</ENAMEX>,
        where the inherent error of measures cannot be accurately
        estimated. Subsequently, gene transcripts determined to be
        outliers from the trend can be considered differentially
        expressed genes. An added strength to the model lies in its
        ease of application to any data set. This model should be
        considered a progressive and cyclical process, where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> can quickly and globally identify a list of
        potentially <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> regulated genes with confidence,
        based on the inherent qualities of the data set under
        evaluation.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> presented herein was developed with a data set
        from a nutritional experiment in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model using
        Affymetrix <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Mu11K</NUMEX> chips, where the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> diets
        were compared in a number of organs (pool of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for
        each sample in each organ): (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) control diet A in duplicate
        from the same pool; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) diet B; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) diet C; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) diet D.
        Details of the dietary treatments will be reported
        elsewhere. The present article will take only the data from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> as an example for the development of a gene
        selection model. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was validated by real-time
        polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indicates good
        concordance between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experimental techniques.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Selection of differentially regulated genes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> analysis
          The method developed herein includes: (A)
          determination of the upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX> of highest fold changes
          within narrow bins of absolute expression levels in order
          to generate a limit fold change (LFC) function; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)
          subsequent ranking of genes by a combined fold
          change/absolute expression calculation. The following
          discussions describe the development of the model within
          the context of our nutritional study; however, a generic
          protocol can be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and Methods
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          (A) Selection of the upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX> of highest fold
          changes within binned absolute expression levels
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> parameter for gene expression data
          stemming from a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> experiment is the
          average difference intensity (ADI), which is a
          representation of the absolute expression of a gene. As
          indicated in the literature, it is common practice to
          establish a minimal expression threshold below which data
          are considered to be noise. In the case of Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, it is often necessary to discard minimal and
          negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADIs</ENAMEX>, as these data are both biologically and
          mathematically difficult to interpret.
          A number of previous reports have used an ADI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX> ( 
          A 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           ) value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> in the standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> range [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">i.e.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>'s of less
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> would either be rejected or set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> as
          meaningful differences in gene expression can purportedly
          be evaluated above this level. Although empirically
          supported, an 
          A 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> is essentially an arbitrary selection and not
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> select the same threshold value. The exact
          setting of this lower 
          A 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           is not inherent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> modeling process, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> is encouraged to set the 
          A 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           value based on additional criteria, such as that
          previously published by Gerhold 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and Dieckgraefe 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . However, an 
          A 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
           of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> will be used in the present work, for which
          the selection of differentially expressed genes in the
          context of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> dependent variance is the central focus.
          Therefore, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 20</NUMEX> were set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> and any
          probe set with a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> across all dietary
          treatments were discarded. After eliminating the probe
          sets which met these criteria there remained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9391</TIMEX> genes
          out of the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13179</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> represented on the Mu11K
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX>.
          An additional parameter, highest fold change (HFC),
          was then applied to these remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> is defined
          as:
          
          where A, B, C, and D represent the individual
          microarray results for each gene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> is inherently a
          ratio metric of the maximum change in measured gene
          expression between any combination of experimental
          treatments. The present experiment has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> dietary
          conditions with microarray data; however, it should be
          noted that the HFC equation could be expanded to any
          number of conditions or experimental treatments.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> is highly influenced by
          absolute expression, and trends can be readily observed
          in our data set where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> is negatively correlated with
          absolute expression (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). For example, with
          absolute expression values greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> it is of low
          probability to observe an HFC greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. However,
          with absolute expression values near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>, an HFC of
          greater than 2 is readily seen. Although not shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>, this trend could be observed for any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> or
          triplet of experimental comparison in the current data
          set, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.e. AB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC, AD</ENAMEX>, BC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCD</ENAMEX>.
          It has also been observed across multiple experiments
          examined in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consistancy</ENAMEX> can be explained by the fact that there are
          very few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> out of the entire transcriptome which are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed due to treatment. Therefore,
          most measured gene transcripts display a typical
          coefficient of variation independent of treatment. The
          few genes which are differentially expressed do not
          unduly affect the overall trend. Therefore, the trend
          lends itself to characterization and may be used as a
          metric for determining differential gene expression
          across multiple experiments.
          This empirically implies that natural variation,
          expressed here as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX>, tends to be much greater at low
          expression levels. This concept is supported in the
          literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and questions the appropriateness of
          using a linear fold change cut-off in a system
          characterized by heterogenous variance.
          As stated previously, the selection of differentially
          expressed genes is essentially a search for outliers, 
          i.e. gene data lying outside some
          standard distribution of differences relative to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control state</ENAMEX>, and which cannot be ascribed to chance or
          natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variabilty</ENAMEX>. To determine those genes which are
          outliers, it is necessary to measure either the
          variability of the system or to make valid assumptions
          regarding the distribution of variability. In the present
          model we assume that: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) as mentioned above, variability
          in the measurement of gene expression is related to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) if a broad sampling of the transcriptome is
          measured, only a small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will actually be
          outliers even in the harshest of experimental conditions.
          Assumption (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) is a fairly general analytical concept, 
          i.e. the closer data is to the
          measurement threshold, the higher the variability is in
          that measurement [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 19</NUMEX> ] . Assumption (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) appears to be
          empiricaly valid when surveying the literature for
          high-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments which evaluate severe
          biological events, from caloric restriction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . In these experiments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX>
          ] , regardless of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection method used, less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the total number of genes probed were
          differentially regulated. Therefore, to develop the
          present model of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection, the validity of
          selecting outliers was evaluated for a range of highly
          variable genes using the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> as a benchmark. Model
          trends were then examined from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1% to 10%</NUMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was developed by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> binning gene
          expression data into tight classes across the entire
          range of absolute expression values, where genes with an
          equal absolute expression value were randomly ordered,
          and then selecting the upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> values for further
          consideration. Binning was carried out to divide the
          entire range of absolute expression values into bins
          containing an equal number, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> , of genes, where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>. Therefore, bin widths
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>) were not necessarily equal, yet the number of genes
          contained in each bin was equivalent. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round
          of analysis, the upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">95 thpercentile</NUMEX>, of HFC
          genes in each bin were selected for further consideration
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). It was possible to search separately for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of genes with the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFCs</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>;
          however, in order to simplify the overall selection, we
          plotted the relationship between absolute expression,
          defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">min ADI</ENAMEX> (A,B,C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX>, in order to set
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> function. Herein, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">min ADI</ENAMEX> (A,B,C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) will
          simply be referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">min ADI</ENAMEX>. This relationship was
          then modeled using a simple equation of the form 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> = a + (b/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX> ADI) , which is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitted</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> thpercentile of each bin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>) to
          produce the LFC curve that best models the expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. This modeled LFC curve (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.74</NUMEX> +
          91.55/min <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>) fit the data well (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>) and further
          analysis indicated the residuals were randomly
          distributed (data not shown). The equation for the line
          of best fit contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters that have various
          repercussions on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection, both of which can be
          defined in commercially available software using common
          "solve" functions ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX>). First, 
          a sets the asymptote, which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the minimum HFC value that can be observed
          at any given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, 
          b raises/lowers the limit function
          at a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>, and is therefore highly influenced by
          this latter value. For example, the smaller the ADI the
          greater the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX>, and vice versa. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1bshows</TIMEX> that as
          the selection criteria becomes more strict (top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% â†’ 1%</NUMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), the curve shifts (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.43</NUMEX> +
          166.12/min <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>) and becomes more restrictive in the
          selection of differential genes, 
          i.e. at any given absolute
          expression level a higher fold change must be observed
          for a gene to be considered differentially expressed. The
          opposite is true when the selection criteria becomes less
          strict (top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% â†’ 10%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), where the curve shifts
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.59</NUMEX> + 69.47/min <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>) and results in a
          more permissive selection of differential genes.
          Using the aforementioned equations the selection of
          genes for further consideration becomes simple and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'global'</ENAMEX> ( 
          i.e. across the entire range of
          expression levels); where a gene is selected with the HFC
          approach if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">max ADI/min ADI ></ENAMEX> a+(b/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX> ADI). After
          applying the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> gene filter, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">869</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> remained in
          the list out of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9391</TIMEX> candidate genes selected from
          the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13179</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX>. When interested
          in the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% and 1%</NUMEX> of significant genes, the total
          number of genes that meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LFC</ENAMEX> requirements is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">471</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX>, respectively.
          Lastly it should be noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX>, 
          i.e. the modeled trend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> vs.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">min ADI</ENAMEX>, is based on binned data of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of genes
          across multiple conditions leading to a highly powerful
          characterization of a given threshold. In other words,
          there is a large amount of data available in order to
          accurately characterize the trend. The same argument
          holds for the generation of a modeled confidence interval
          based on low numbers of replicates, as will be described
          below. This is in contrast to the relatively low
          statistical power of conventional "gene-by-gene" tests
          such as the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test or ANOVA, often used for
          the selection of differentially expressed genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) Assignment of gene rank
          Following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection, a rank of 'importance' or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'interest</ENAMEX> level' was assigned to each selected gene. It
          should be noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> is not dependent on the rank
          calculation; rather rank simply lends relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'importance</ENAMEX>' to selected genes by incorporating both the
          magnitude of fold change and absolute expression values.
          The rank number (RN) for each gene was determined by
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> calculating a rank value (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>), which can be defined
          as: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> * (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">max ADI - min ADI</ENAMEX>). After calculation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>, gene lists were sorted and then assigned a simple RN
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,4...</NUMEX>, where a gene with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RN</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> corresponds to
          the gene with the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> is an arbitrary
          value that simply lends importance to selected genes with
          both high fold changes and high differences in absolute
          expression. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RN</ENAMEX> aid in the discussion of
          differential gene effects by adding the concept of
          relative weight or importance amongst selected genes.
          This concept aids in the choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for validation
          or follow-up studies, as detailed below.
        
        
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C) Model</ENAMEX> validation
          
            Validation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model via characterization
            of measurement variability
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hess</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have recently examined the
            concept that variability and absolute expression are
            related; however, they examined only the variability of
            replicate spots on a single slide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Herein, we
            extended this concept to examine the variability
            between genes on different microarrays. Measurement
            variance was examined following the development of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, and was therefore used simply as a
            confirmation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. To further understand the
            nature of measurement variability within the current
            study, duplicate Mu11K <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> microarrays for the
            controls were examined (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and Methods
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX>). A pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sample</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) fed the control diet was
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different chips, and the data was
            analyzed to characterize measurement variability. It
            was apparent from the trend that as absolute expression
            levels (ADI) increase, the coefficient of variation
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>= <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD/MAE</ENAMEX>) decreases. The trendline was calculated as
            detailed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section. This
            trendline was overlayed on the entire data set, in
            addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> selected data (shown in red), in
            Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1c</TIMEX>. By overlaying the trendline of the within
            variability data on those genes determined to be
            significantly regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the CV upper
            confidence limit for these selected genes had a 
            p value â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.001</NUMEX>. Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
            LFC-selected data lies outside the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> confidence
            interval surrounding measurement variability,
            reinforcing the validity of the results.
          
          
            Real-time polymerase chain reaction
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>)
            The results obtained from a microarray experiment
            are influenced by each step in the experimental
            procedure, from array manufacturing to sample
            preparation and application to image analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
            The preparation of the cRNA sample is highly correlated
            to the efficiency of the reverse transcription step,
            where reagents and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> alike can influence the
            reaction outcome. These factors affect the
            representation of transcripts in the cRNA sample,
            necessitating the need for validations by complementary
            techniques. Analyses by northern blot and RNAse
            protection assays are commonly reported; however, the
            emerging 'gold-standard' validation technique is RT-PCR
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Microarrays</ENAMEX> tend to have a low dynamic range,
            which can lead to small yet significant
            under-representations of fold changes in gene
            expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> has a greater dynamic
            range, it is often used to validate the observed trends
            rather than duplicate the fold changes obtained by chip
            experiments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 28 29</NUMEX> ] .
            Having chosen genes that lie across the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RN</ENAMEX>,
            and therefore the range of model selection criteria,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was performed in triplicate for each
            experimental condition (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet</ENAMEX> A,B,C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) using the same
            pooled stocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> per experiment).
            Genes were compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">endogenous</ENAMEX> controls Î²-actin
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX>, which did not significantly change across
            the dietary treatments. As determined by our LFC
            selection model, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> microarrays indicated no
            significant differences amongst the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> diets for either
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-actin</NUMEX>. Subsequent confirmation that both
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> and Î²-actin did not change was provided by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, where a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test with a predefined nominal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> indicated no significant differences
            between the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diets</ENAMEX> (B,C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) and the control
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet A. RT-PCR</ENAMEX> provided a means to confirm the effects
            of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> dietary treatments on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and
            the concordance between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> microarray and RT-PCR
            results was examined. Perfect concordance was not to be
            expected due to the inherent differences in sensitivity
            and dynamic range between the two techniques. However,
            a good overall concordance of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.7%</NUMEX> for differential
            gene expression was observed, 
            i.e. the fold change for a given
            gene seen by microarray was directionally consistent
            with that seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, regardless whether the
            results were significant by either the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model
            (for microarray data) or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>test (for RT-PCR
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>). When examining only those genes considered
            significantly changed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (Î± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, starred
            values in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), concordance increases to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.7%</NUMEX>.
            Therefore, the value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.7%</NUMEX> indicates the overall
            concordance between significantly changed genes seen by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and those microarray pairwise comparisons
            (treatment vs. control) that meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criteria (Â§</ENAMEX> values in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
            What is noticeable through the color scheme (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is genes with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RN</ENAMEX> (low <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>) have relatively less
            concordance between the two techniques; where red
            indicates no concordance and blue indicates only one or
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>) of the results agreed. However, the
            majority of genes are colored in green, indicating
            perfect directional concordance. When specifically
            examining fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid synthase</ENAMEX> (FAS), a highly expressed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> fold changes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 2</NUMEX> can be
            corroborated between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experimental techniques,
            reinforcing the strength of this fold change model.
            Furthermore, it is clear from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data that at
            very low expression levels, high fold changes are still
            problematic to verify and remain questionable. The
            present model takes this into account by raising the
            criteria appropriately at the low expression range, 
            i.e. a higher fold change at low
            expression levels is required for a gene to be
            considered differentially expressed.
            As the selection criteria with microarray data was
            that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> must be greater than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model limits,
            the expectation was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> function could be
            validated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (underlined values in Table
            1indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFC</ENAMEX> for each gene). This is predominantly the
            case across the full dynamic range of data selected by
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.7%</NUMEX> / <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.7 %</NUMEX> concordance), except for very
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lowly</ENAMEX> expressed genes such as the RAS oncogene. For
            genes with a slightly lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RN</ENAMEX> (higher <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX>), such as
            ABC1 member <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, some concordance is seen, indicating
            confidence is gaining as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> increases. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with
            an RN lower than 130 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RV</ENAMEX> > <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1156</TIMEX>; 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USF-2</ENAMEX>) concordance quickly
            approaches <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, indicating high confidence when
            discussing gene trends or individual gene results.
            These results reinforce the concept that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RN</ENAMEX> is
            correlated with confidence and validity when discussing
            the gene set produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
            Interestingly, one might expect that genes with an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RN</ENAMEX> lower then 130 would be concentrated only at higher
            expression levels; however, when the spread of genes
            with an RN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> were examined, these genes
            were found to lie across the entire range of absolute
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expressions</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This indicates that a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is confidently selecting differentially
            regulated genes across the full range of absolute
            expression. Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> appears to be
            an appropriate selection criteria for the present
            experimental data set; however, the fold change
            percentage could easily be varied to meet other
            acceptable levels of risk, as is done with conventional
            hypothesis testing ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g. Î±-,</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -</ENAMEX>, and Ï‡ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-values). The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX>
            selection criteria should then be re-evaluated for
            other experimental data sets in relation to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> and validation data at hand.
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The analysis of microarray data is a developing field of
        study aimed at enabling the biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to cope
        with the waves of large microarray data sets. Already, an
        evolution can be observed with respect to the methods for
        selecting significantly changed genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> are
        moving away from simple fold change cut-offs and
        incorporating the use of robust statistical concepts. The
        conclusion that highly expressed genes will rarely have a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold change in mRNA levels and that lowly expressed genes
        will commonly have a greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold change led to the
        development of a model that would accommodate for this real
        biological characteristic of gene expression measurements.
        The fold change model presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> considers
        both the absolute expression level and fold change of every
        gene across the entire range of observed absolute
        expressions. In addition, the concept of increased
        variation in lowly expressed genes is incorporated into the
        selection <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> through the higher fold change requirements
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differential gene</ENAMEX> selection at low expression levels.
        Following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection using an initial criterion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX>,
        gene rank was introduced as a basis for choosing genes to
        validate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a limited but judicious
        choice of model parameters to select genes across a broad
        range of gene rank can then be used to reset the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX> in
        order to correspond with the data at hand (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
        variance data characterizing measurement variability
        supports the selection model, indicating that selected
        genes lie outside measurement variability at very high
        confidence limits (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>). Further validation of
        this model in the current data set by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> confirmed
        these relationships, reinforcing that genes with fold
        changes even less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> can be measured, assuming
        adequate absolute expression levels. This demonstrates that
        biological changes in sample concentration of mRNA, even at
        low fold change levels, can be confidently determined.
        In summary, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> model enables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to define
        experiment specific selection stringency while maintaining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplicity</ENAMEX> and ensuring global coverage for the detection
        of differential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection.

            cRNA preparation
            Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î¼g</NUMEX>) was used as starting material for
            all samples. In all cases, a "test chip" provided by
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> was run prior to using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Murine</ENAMEX> 11k
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX>. In each case this confirmed that sufficient
            high quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was present to detect gene expression
            in the various tissue samples. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and second

            together with unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTP</ENAMEX>'s in the reaction.
            Following the

            visualization
            Overall, the values of all genes are compared across
            any number ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ) of experimental conditions.
            The absolute expression value of the

              kj 
             . When considering any given gene, the following
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-handling rules are applied:
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€¢ All</ENAMEX> values below an ADI threshold ( 
            A 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             ) are set to 
            A 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             .
            â€¢ If the values for gene 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> are 
            A 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
             for all 
            p treatments, the gene is defined
            as not expressed and isn't considered further.
            â€¢ The absolute expression value for gene 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is defined as 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> ( 
            Z 
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , ..., 
            Z 
            
              kp 
             ).
            â€¢ The highest fold change (HFC) of gene 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is defined as the
            following:
            
            When visualizing all genes on a bivariate plot
            according to absolute expression and fold change, one
            obtains a data distribution similar to that of Figure
            1a.
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Modeling a discrete limit fold change
            model
            The goal is to select the upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX> of genes with
            highest fold change across the entire range of
            expression levels. Therefore, the following rules are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>:
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€¢ Genes</ENAMEX> are ordered according to their absolute
            expression value 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> ( 
            Z 
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , ..., 
            Z 
            
              kp 
             ), where equally expressed genes are randomly
            ordered.
            â€¢ The overall expression range is divided into bins
            of different width, but containing an equal number 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> of genes.
            â€¢ In each bin, the (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1-X</NUMEX>)-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">percentile</ENAMEX> fold change
            corresponding to a fold change that is exceeded by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X%</NUMEX>
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the bin is determined. For <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X% between 1%</NUMEX>
            and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> appears to be
            suitable.
            When visualizing the (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1-X</NUMEX>)-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">percentile</ENAMEX> fold change in
            each bin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> obtains a data distribution similar to
            that seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>.
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Modeling a continuous limit fold change (LFC)
            model
            A continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is derived from the discrete one
            by relating the mean expressions of each bin with the
            corresponding (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1-X</NUMEX>)-limit fold change, using a least
            squares fit of the equation:
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1-X</NUMEX>)-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> = 
            a + 
            b /<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX> (minimum expression)
            This equation appears to fit the data very well and,
            the interpretation of the parameters ( 
            a and 
            b ) is straightforward:
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢ Parameter</ENAMEX> 
            a represents the asymptote of the
            curve. For very large expressions, the (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-</ENAMEX> 
            X )-limit fold change tends to be
            equal to parameter 
            a .
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢ Parameter</ENAMEX> 
            b is proportional to the
            difference between the (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1-X</NUMEX>)-limit fold change of small
            and high expressions.
            When visualizing this continuous limit fold change
            model, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> obtains a curve similar to that observed in
            Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>. In addition, increasing the (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1-X</NUMEX>)-percentile
            fold change shifts the curve up the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -axis and results in an
            increased stringency for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection, 
            i.e. fewer genes meet the LFC
            requirement (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>).
          
          
            Validation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coefficient</ENAMEX> of Variance
            For experiments that are performed without
            replicates, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX>-model selects genes with the
            highest between-treatment variability (previously
            defined as fold change) at any expression level. If
            replicates are available, the inherent error of
            measures, the within-treatment variability, can be
            estimated. Therefore, it becomes possible to select the
            genes with the highest ratio of
            between-treatment-variability /
            within-treatment-variability.
            In the data set that was used for illustrating the
            development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX>-model, duplicate measures were
            available for one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> treatments. The
            within-treatment-variability appears to be highly
            dependent of the expression level of the gene,
            confirming the findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hess</ENAMEX> 
            et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
            In order to estimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> without taking into
            account extreme values of the duplicate we used a
            robust estimator, represented by the following
            equation:
            
            where the Ï‡ 
            
              inverse 
             function returns the inverse of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed
            probability of the Ï‡-squared distribution.
            Applying the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CV</ENAMEX> derived from replicate sample data (
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eqn</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) to the quadruplicate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diet</ENAMEX> data enabled the calculation of the CV upper
            confidence level (by bins of absolute expression level)
            using the following equation:
            
            where the Ï‡ 
            
              inverse 
             function returns the inverse of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed
            probability of the Ï‡-squared distribution.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqn</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to identify
            genes with a variance above measurement variability.
            This greater variability arose due to combined pool
            (biological) and treatment variabilities.
            This confidence level could be raised or lowered
            according to the level of confidence desired by
            altering the 
            p value. Therefore, modeling the
            variance data provides a complimentary method for
            examining the variation of genes across the complete
            range of absolute expression values.
            The upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> confidence limit (CL) of a robust
            estimation of the coefficient of variance (CV) for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX> (within-treatment variability) has been
            modeled as a function of absolute minimum expression of
            all treatments using the following model:
            Upper <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> = 
            c + 
            d /mean expression
            The selected genes are now those for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> of
            treatment expressions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-treatment variability)
            is larger than this limit (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>). By overlapping
            those genes selected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (red dots) on the
            graph indicating the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> (blue line), one observes
            that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is considerably more restrictive
            when selecting lowly expressed genes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>).
          
          
            Validation by real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (RT-PCR)
            A subset of differentially expressed genes were
            selected to confirm the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
            selected across the range of absolute expressions and
            with varying fold changes. Although not discussed in
            the present manuscript, a good description of the
            technique and an example of an excellent experimental
            design can be found in previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 30</NUMEX> ]
            , respectively. In brief, all genes were amplified in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5700</TIMEX> instrument using SYBR
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â®green</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>), a dye that binds
            double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> represented means of
            triplicates for each experimental treatment using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pooled RNA samples</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Amplification was
            performed using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ABI 5700</ENAMEX> machine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) with a hot start at
            95Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">95Â°C</ENAMEX> for
            15 s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">60Â°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> for denaturation, annealing and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX>. Genes were normalized to either Î²-actin or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX>, and then experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diets</ENAMEX> (B,C,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) were
            compared to the control diet (A). All fold changes were
            subjected to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test (Î± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>) to ensure fold
            changes observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> were statistically
            significant. Comparisons between microarray data and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> were then performed.

        Average Difference Intensity
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX>): average measure of intensity of hybridization
        for a series of match and mismatch probe pairs tiled across
        a particular gene transcript. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADI</ENAMEX> is an indicator of the
        absolute expression of a gene.
        
        Concordance: state of agreement between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complementary measurement techniques which is
        directionally consistent, 
        e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> techniques determine that
        values are statistically significant and that they are both
        either positive or negative.
