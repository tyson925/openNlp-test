        The ability of 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria
        to infect and replicate inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> mononuclear phagocytes
        is key to its ability to establish an infection and cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX>. To elucidate the mechanisms used by tubercle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacilli</ENAMEX> to survive in macrophages, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> at several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> are studying mycobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> specifically
        expressed during growth in macrophages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> specifically expressed during intracellular
        growth are genes encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two extracytoplasmic</NUMEX> function
        sigma factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SigE (Ïƒ E</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SigH (Ïƒ H</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>
        factors play critical roles in the recognition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>. In several systems, individual sigma
        factors are known to regulate the differential expression
        of sets of genes involved in specific processes, such as
        genes involved in the heat-shock response or those required
        for sporulation in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Identifying a differentially expressed sigma factor can
        provide a means to identifying other differentially
        expressed genes - genes whose expression are controlled by
        the sigma factor. To identify sigma factor-regulated genes,
        we developed a method, termed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX>, for the 
        i dentification of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ranscriptional 
        r egulator 
        a ctivated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> romoters. I-TRAP takes advantage
        of the fact that some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be differentially
        expressed in the presence and absence of a transcription
        regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. To identify transcription
        factor-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, a genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is
        generated in a promoter-trap plasmid containing two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reporter genes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is transformed into strain
        expressing the transcription factor, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmids</ENAMEX> containing an active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> are selected by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">virtue</ENAMEX> of expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> genes. The
        plasmids are recovered and transformed into a strain that
        does not express the transcription factor. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Promoters</ENAMEX>
        dependent on the expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> are
        differentiated from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> by screening for lack
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> not expressing the
        regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. To illustrate the development and use
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> approach, we describe here the construction
        of the vectors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> strains, and library necessary to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">identify Ïƒ E-</ENAMEX>regulated genes of

          Experimental strategy
          The basic I-TRAP approach (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) uses a genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> in a plasmid vector containing a promoterless
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'operon</ENAMEX>' with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> genes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene, the 
          aph gene which confers resistance
          to kanamycin, allows for selection of active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          and a second <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene, the 
          xylE gene which encodes catechol
          2,3 dioxygenase, allows for screening for loss of
          promoter activity. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX>
          approach, the recombinant plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is transformed
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> expressing the transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Transformants</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmids</ENAMEX> with active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          are isolated by selection on kanamycin-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.
          A subset of the active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> will be those whose
          expression depends on the transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>. To
          differentiate between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> dependent on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from a pool of
          the kanamycin-resistant transformants is transformed into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that do not express the transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>. The hygromycin B-resistant transformants are
          screened for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XylE</ENAMEX> expression by spraying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catechol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> arise from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that
          contain a plasmid with a transcriptionally active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. White <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> arise from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that contain
          a plasmid with a promoter that is inactive in the absence
          of the transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>.

          To recover <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmids</ENAMEX> containing active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, the
          plasmid library <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was electroporated into

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1.9%</NUMEX> of transformants contained an active
          promoter fragment. When the initial pool of
          kanamycin-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> sprayed with catechol, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were light to dark yellow indicating a wide

          plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated and electroporated into

          sigE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, in which the wild
          type copy of the 
          sigE gene had been disrupted with
          the gentamicin-resistance gene. Transformants were plated
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hygromycin</TIMEX> B and assayed for catechol 2,3 dioxygenase
          activity by spraying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> catechol. About
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were sprayed with catechol, and a range
          of color intensity from white to bright yellow was
          observed. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX> white and light yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          were recovered. Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1.8%</NUMEX> of hygromycin
          B-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were white or light yellow.
          To confirm the phenotypes of plasmids recovered in
          this two-step procedure, plasmids were recovered from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and individually transformed into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LR222</ENAMEX>::<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEint</ENAMEX>.2
          (SigE-expressing) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LR222</ENAMEX>::Î” 
          sigE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> plasmids
          generated only white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> when transformed into the Ïƒ
          E-mutant strain. However, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 18</NUMEX> plasmids
          generated yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> when transformed into Ïƒ
          E-expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, some plasmids produced a mixture
          of white and yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. These white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were
          consistently white on retesting and their plasmids
          usually contained deletions that removed the cloned 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis sequence. Replating
          of the yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> produced a mixture of white and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the expression of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xylE</ENAMEX> or 
          aph <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SigE</ENAMEX>-expressing
          strain may be detrimental to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and may lead to
          plasmid instability.
          A preliminary analysis of the sequences of the inserts
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> clones identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> inserts that had matches
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SigE</ENAMEX> consensus sequence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Interestingly,
          none of these genes were identified as being SigE-induced
          genes in microarray studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , although the
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the genes, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rv3223c</TIMEX> ( 
          sigH ), is thought to be
          SigE-regulated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A key feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> method is that it allows two
        degrees of promoter analysis, i.e., with and without a
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step allows selection
        of all active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> under one condition, and the second
        step sorts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> by activity dependent on a second
        condition. In the study reported here, we used this method
        to identify potential Ïƒ <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-induced</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The basic I-TRAP
        approach might also be used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> repressed
        by a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The transformation steps are
        reversed so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> are selected in the mutant
        background <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (i.e., no repressor) and then screened for
        loss of activity in the presence of the repressor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> method might also be used to characterize
        promoter activity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> environmental conditions in a
        manner similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVET</ENAMEX> approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . This is useful
        because, in some cases, the factor necessary for
        transcriptional activation during a particular
        environmental condition is unknown. In this case, after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exposing bacteria</ENAMEX> containing the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> to an
        environmental condition (e.g., a heat shock or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> shock
        or growth in medium A), antibiotics could be added to the
        medium to kill any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that had not expressed the
        antibiotic resistance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene during the exposure.
        For mycobacteria, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> treatment with kanamycin would
        be sufficient to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that had not expressed the
        kanamycin-resistance gene during the stress. The resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> would then be grown in a second medium or in the
        absence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> scored for lack of
        promoter activity in the second condition by expression of
        the 
        xylE <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene. White <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
        would contain a plasmid with a promoter that is active only
        during the first condition. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> for this purpose
        may provide a means to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> dependent on any
        of several regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that may be active during
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and to obtain a global overview of gene
        expression during the stress.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> method, the recipient strain can be the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native bacterium</ENAMEX> or a surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. We used 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> because it
        grows much more rapidly than does 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> time of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hrs</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24 hrs</NUMEX>), does not require BSL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and is
        more easily manipulated genetically than 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible
        advantage of using a surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is that studies could
        be focused on one particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> which might avoid
        complications due to other regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the cell
        that may be able to recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. Of
        course, the surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> must not have a regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that recognizes the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> as the regulator
        being studied. In our studies, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis Ïƒ Eprotein</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>
        homology with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis Ïƒ Eprotein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        While this suggests that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis Ïƒ Eprotein</ENAMEX> should be
        able to interact properly with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>, it also
        suggests that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis Ïƒ Ehomolog</ENAMEX> might be able
        to recognize 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis Ïƒ</ENAMEX> E-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. Because of this, we constructed an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis host strain that lacked
        any functional Ïƒ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eprotein</ENAMEX>.
        An assumption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> approach is that the
        sequences cloned in the plasmids will be recognized by
        transcriptional regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the same manner as
        the intact sequences in the genome. The cloning process
        might generate false-positive or false-negative results
        because of the cloned sequences being recognized out of the
        context of the surrounding genomic sequences.
        Another assumption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> approach is that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of a transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> will be
        sufficient to induce gene expression from its regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. This suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PhoP</ENAMEX>, that
        require activation to promote transcription may not be
        approachable with this method unless the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed
        regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can also be activated. Also, certain
        regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may not be suitable for study in a
        surrogate host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that require
        the presence of additional factors, such as Ïƒ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, or
        interaction with host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to be active, such as Ïƒ
        Ewith <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>, use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native bacterium</ENAMEX> or
        closely related surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> may be required to ensure
        the presence of the necessary interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Some of these additional factors, however, may only be
        expressed or active under a particular growth condition and
        therefore may also need to be conditionally expressed along
        with the transcription factor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Promoters</ENAMEX> that require both
        a positive transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> and the absence of a
        repressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may be missed because expressing the
        positive transcription factor alone may not be sufficient
        to induce transcription at such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. Another
        limitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> method is that some transcription
        factors may not be stably maintained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> or
        may be lethal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> when over-expressed. To
        avoid this problem, an inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> could be used to
        promote transcription of the gene encoding the
        transcription factor.
        Another possible complication of this approach is that
        expressing a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may turn on the stress
        response of the host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>. Transcription factors
        mediating the stress response to the expressed foreign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may be able to recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> and promote transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> genes,
        thus producing the false positives in the two-step
        screen.
        Because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> method involves
        selection for active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, one could easily begin with
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinants</ENAMEX> representing all possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in a bacterial genome. Unfortunately, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> used in this study contained only
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of the genome in the correct orientation upstream of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> genes, which will limit the number of
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> we can recover using this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. For
        the screening step, we used the 
        xylE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> because catechol 2,3
        dioxygenase activity is easily measured by spraying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> with catechol and the amount of color produced is
        a rough measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In our
        screen, white, pale yellow, and bright yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were
        observed, indicating a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> activity.
        Pale yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> may represent weak Ïƒ E-independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that are recognized by another sigma
        factor in addition to Ïƒ E, providing a low level of
        constitutive expression. These possibilities could be
        distinguished by transformation of plasmids from individual
        clones into the Ïƒ E-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressing strain and directly
        comparing of XylE activity in the presence and absence of Ïƒ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Unfortunately</ENAMEX>, it appears that expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XylE</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis</ENAMEX> may be detrimental and
        may lead to plasmid instability and loss of the inserted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. This raises the possibility that some white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
        may arise in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> by loss of a
        promoter fragment from a plasmid recovered in the first
        step. Nonetheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> method should greatly enrich
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> with the desired activities. As is generally
        true for genetic screens, it is essential to study any
        identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in their native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to understand
        the regulation of their expression.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TRAP</ENAMEX> method is a versatile and useful method for
        characterizing promoter activity under a variety of
        conditions and in response to various regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        In our study, we isolated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX> clones that may contain
        plasmids carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SigE</ENAMEX>-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> genes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis . The analysis of
        these clones will be reported elsewhere.
