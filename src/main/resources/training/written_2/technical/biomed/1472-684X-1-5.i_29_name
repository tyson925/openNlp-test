        A wide range of symptoms produce considerable suffering
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at the end of their lives. This monograph aims
        to summarize the core competencies in symptom control
        needed by any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, no matter his or her specialty.
        Many of the approaches will apply much earlier in the
        course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, not just at the end of life.
        The monograph does not purport to summarize specialist
        knowledge. While some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> will have specialist
        palliative care services upon which to call, most in the
        world will need to provide the initial approaches to
        symptom control at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end-</TIMEX>of-life. This is not a fringe
        activity, but a core competency for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>. After an
        overview of the approaches to whole patient assessment, we
        summarize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of several of the more common
        symptoms that occur at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end-</TIMEX>of-life.
        However, to focus on symptom control skills alone will
        miss the mark. To be effective in end-of-life care,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> must also have a broad conceptualization of
        end-of-life care and the legal issues that support it [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        and they must be competent in communication,
        decision-making and relation-building skills [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . While
        we hope each pearl can improve a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s practice, the
        complete 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education for Physicians on End</ENAMEX>-of-life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> (EPEC) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curriculum</ENAMEX> should be mastered in order to
        be fully effective. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
      
      
        Methods
        To increase physician knowledge of new developments in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palliation</ENAMEX> and their level of clinical competence in
        end-of-life care, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for Ethics</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>, with support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Wood</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Foundation</ENAMEX>, embarked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Physicians on End-of-life Care</ENAMEX> (EPEC) Project. The overall
        goal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPEC Project</ENAMEX> is to teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> how to
        provide better care to terminally ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The overall
        method is to use a "train-the-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX>" dissemination model.
        The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is that a core curriculum designed,
        written and taught by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> using state of the art
        clinical knowledge and education theory, can be effective
        in reaching a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> tier of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> by having the newly
        trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> return to their work settings and seek
        to engage and educate a growing number of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> using
        and adapting the provided educational materials. The
        project aims to improve end-of-life care through a ripple
        effect as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trainers</ENAMEX> educate a growing number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>.
        A key tool of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPEC Project</ENAMEX> was the development of
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPEC Curriculum</ENAMEX>. It sets out the core
        competencies that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> should have in palliative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. It was not intended to define or describe the
        specialty skills of a palliative medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>. Two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advisory Boards</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert physicians</ENAMEX> in ethics, hospice,
        and palliative care initially recommended the curricular
        content and format. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> with considerable
        clinical and research experience and expertise in physician
        education then developed the curriculum. Finally, it was
        modified based on the opinions of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        and other health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> trained to teach
        end-of-life care using the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">EPEC Curriculum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPEC Trainers</ENAMEX>). The
        final 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPEC Curriculum</ENAMEX> represents a
        synthesis of the ideas of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and clinicians. The
        information in the present manuscript is extracted from
        this curriculum

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whole Patient Assessment</ENAMEX>
          Management strategies to relieve suffering in
          end-of-life care begin with a comprehensive assessment of
          the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. This approach
          to assessment may be quite distinct from familiar history
          taking and physical examination techniques. Whole patient
          assessment examines a range of issues that may cause
          suffering. It forms the basis for setting goals of care
          rather than seeking problem-based solutions. The
          assessment process itself can be a therapeutic tool. It
          acknowledges the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and conveys
          compassion. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ]
          During the assessment, ask about each of the possible
          symptoms and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s functional activities, rather
          than about organ systems or anatomy. Because symptoms are
          inherently subjective, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> self-report is the gold
          standard for assessment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Validated symptom
          assessment tools may assist the clinician to gain
          consistent insight into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s perception of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symptom</ENAMEX> (eg, its severity, etc). When considering
          diagnostic tests, assess their potential to assist relief
          of suffering rather than diagnosis for its own sake.
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with an advanced life-threatening illness
          experience situational and possibly pathological changes
          in their affect and cognitive function, and a range of
          emotions and fears. Fear of loss of control and dignity,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abandonment</ENAMEX>, being a burden, and physical suffering can
          be so strong that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> desire hastened death.
          Screening questions to assess for depression, anxiety and
          cognitive impairment, and inquiries about coping
          responses and fears, are all important since these issues
          can be redressed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] .
          While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> may not have the skills of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, he or she should be able to make an
          initial assessment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s social and practical
          needs. Unresolved relationships or financial, legal, or
          practical matters may be sources of distress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          Because <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> spend their life savings and/or
          lose a source of income in order to care for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
          it is important to know about financial status and health
          insurance coverage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The need for practical help
          must be addressed; even the best of care plans may fail
          if the chores of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> living are not attended to [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] .
          Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has a spiritual dimension to his or her
          life. Whether it is understood in frankly religious
          terms, or in terms of personal meaning and the mystery of
          life, studies suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> welcome inquiry about
          their spiritual issues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . While a chaplain or
          skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pastor</ENAMEX> usually administers spiritual care, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> must consider the possibility that spiritual
          pain also manifests itself as physical, mental, or social
          distress.
          Equipped with a full assessment of the nature and
          context of the issues that are causing suffering for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> can then address each
          issue in turn. The following addresses some of the most
          common physical issues and some touches on some of the
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or social issues they raise.
        
        
          Pain
          Pain occurs frequently in end-of-life care. It can be
          acute or chronic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          Pain can be nociceptive or neuropathic in origin. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s description, physical findings, and the results
          of laboratory tests and imaging studies will usually be
          sufficient for a provisional diagnosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          Nociceptive pain involves direct stimulation of intact
          mechanical, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, or thermal nociceptors, and
          transmission of electrical signals along normally
          functioning nerves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> may describe this as sharp,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aching</ENAMEX>, and/or throbbing pain that is easily localized.
          Visceral nociceptive pain (eg, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX>, lung, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GU</ENAMEX>)
          results from stimulation of the autonomic nervous system
          and may be difficult to describe or localize.
          Neuropathic pain is presumed to result from disordered
          function of the peripheral or central nervous system due
          to any of many potential causes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> tend to
          describe neuropathic pain with words like burning,
          tingling, numbness, shooting, stabbing, or electric-like
          feelings.
        
        
          Management
          Effective pain management requires a clear
          understanding of the etiology and neuropathophysiology of
          each pain, and the pharmacology of analgesics.
          Nociceptive pain generally responds well to opioids
          and/or coanalgesics. Although neuropathic pain may
          respond well to opioids, adjuvant analgesics (tricyclic
          antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, etc)
          are often required in combination with opioids to achieve
          adequate relief.
          Although research is not yet conclusive, unmanaged
          pain itself may lead to changes in the nervous system
          that could reduce its responsiveness to treatment. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] Equally important, unrelieved pain can have a
          devastating psychological effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and
          family [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . As there is no reason to delay the use of
          analgesics, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] initiate analgesic interventions while
          completing investigations and providing therapies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> against the cause of the pain (eg, radiation for
          a neoplasm).
          Placebos have no role to play in the assessment or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of pain outside of clinical trials [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
          Neither is there rationale for concerns that appropriate
          doses of analgesics will "mask" signs that will prevent
          accurate diagnosis and treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] .
          Frequently, pharmacological and non-pharmacological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX> and an interdisciplinary plan that includes
          other health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pharmacists</ENAMEX>, chaplains, physiotherapists, occupational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapists</ENAMEX>, child life <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>, etc) are required to
          manage pain effectively. Plans must be tailored to the
          expectations and needs of each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and
          family. Flexibility and ongoing education of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
          family, and all caregivers, ongoing assessment of
          treatment outcomes, and regular review of the plan of
          care are all essential [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . When a plan does not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s pain in a timely manner, ask for help
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> with more expertise.
        
        
          WHO <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-Step Model</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide Analgesic</ENAMEX> Dosing
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> (WHO) developed
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-step conceptual model to guide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> pain (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . It provides a simple,
          well-tested model to guide the initial selection,
          administration, and titration of analgesics to manage the
          pain associated with any serious illness. When initiating
          or titrating analgesics, it is not necessary to traverse
          each step of the model sequentially; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with
          severe pain (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7-10/10</NUMEX> on a numerical or visual analogue
          scale - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAS</ENAMEX> or VAS) may need to have step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> opioids from
          the outset.
        
        
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Analgesics
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acetaminophen</ENAMEX> and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASA</ENAMEX>) have an important role in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symptom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. However, all have a ceiling effect to
          their analgesia (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">See</ENAMEX> table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . All step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          analgesics have a risk of adverse effects that are
          potentially life-threatening.
          The mechanism of action of acetaminophen is still
          unknown (although it is known that it does not have a
          peripheral anti-inflammatory effect). Typically, it is
          used alone or combined with other analgesics (as a
          coanalgesic for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> or synergistic analgesic
          effects). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who may think more is better should be
          cautioned that toxicity can ensue at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">> 4 gm</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">acetaminophen/24</NUMEX> hr, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          hepatic compromise.
          NSAIDs work, at least in part, by inhibiting
          cyclo-oxygenase, the enzyme that converts arachidonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to prostaglandins. They act directly at
          neuro-synaptic junctions and by reducing inflammation.
          They can be used alone, or as coanalgesics.
          Extended-release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>, or those with long half-lives
          (eg, piroxicam), are likely to enhance adherence.
          Intravenous formulations are also available (eg,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketorolac</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> must be taken to anticipate the
          potentially adverse effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX> (eg, gastropathy,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX> and inhibition of platelet aggregation) that
          are independent of the route of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The newer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> specific to the isoenzyme cyclo-oxygenase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> may
          have fewer adverse effects, but are less potent and more
          expensive than other possible choices. There is no reason
          not to start with the least expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for a
          clinical trial before moving to more expensive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> Analgesics
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> analgesics include the pure agonist
          opioids, eg, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone,
          hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone. Those suggested
          for step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dosing</ENAMEX> combine a pure agonist opioid with
          either acetaminophen or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> to limit the amount of
          opioid that can be used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          All of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opioids</ENAMEX> except fentanyl follow
          first-order kinetics. They reach their peak plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cmax</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 60 to 90 minutes</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oral</ENAMEX> (including enteral feeding tube) or rectal
          administration, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> after subcutaneous or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intramuscular</ENAMEX> injection, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 minutes</TIMEX> after intravenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">injection</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dosed</ENAMEX> once every half-life,
          steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-5 half-lives.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analgesia</ENAMEX> appears to track with plasma
          concentration. They are eliminated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> at a
          fixed rate irrespective of the dose. The liver first
          conjugates them, then the kidney excretes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90% to 95%</NUMEX> of
          the metabolites. Except for the demethylation of codeine
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">methylmorphine</NUMEX>) to its active metabolite, their
          metabolic pathways do not become saturated.
          Based on these pharmacological principles, if an
          immediate-acting oral opioid is selected and the pain is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continuous</ENAMEX>, or nearly so, give the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication q 4h</ENAMEX> on a
          routine schedule (not "as needed"). The best possible
          pain control for the dose will be achieved within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, once steady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has been reached.
          To control any extra or "breakthrough" pain, provide
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with "as needed" rescue doses of the same
          immediate-acting opioid. Each rescue dose should be about
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-20%</NUMEX> of the total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 hour</NUMEX> dose, offered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">q 1h prn PO</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">q 30 min prn SC</TIMEX> or IM, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">q 10-15 min prn</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>.
          If pain remains uncontrolled after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>, increase
          the routine dose by an amount at least equal to the total
          dose of rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> used during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 24</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. If pain is mild or moderate, an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in the total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose should be expected. If pain
          is severe or uncontrolled, an increase of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50% to 100%</NUMEX>
          should be expected. In fact, if pain is severe and
          uncontrolled after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> doses (eg, crescendo pain), do
          not wait for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> to pass before increasing the
          routine dose. There is no maximum dose for a pure agonist
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opioid</ENAMEX>. Follow the patient closely and titrate the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analgesics</ENAMEX> until the pain is relieved or adverse effects
          are encountered.
          Increasingly, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-24 hours</TIMEX> sustained-release
          formulations of the opioids are becoming widely available
          for routine usage, either as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> or granules. They
          must be ingested whole, not crushed or chewed. A fentanyl
          transdermal patch is also available that can deliver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 72 hours</TIMEX>. Use of these preparations
          is likely to improve patient adherence. Extended-release
          formulations are not indicated for rescue dosing. For
          this purpose, use a concurrent dose of an
          immediate-release formulation of the same opioid.
          Methadone, although the least expensive oral opioid,
          has a long and variable half-life (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>). Only those with
          additional training should use it for pain control.
          Not all opioid analgesics that are commonly available
          are recommended for acute or chronic dosing. Meperidine
          is poorly absorbed orally and has a short half-life of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 2-3 hours</TIMEX>. Its principal metabolite,
          normeperidine, has no analgesic properties of its own,
          has a longer half-life of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 6 hours</TIMEX>, is renally
          excreted, and produces significant adverse effects when
          it accumulates. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Propoxyphene</ENAMEX> is typically administered at
          doses that produce relatively little analgesia. The mixed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opioid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agonist-antagonists</ENAMEX> such as pentazocine,
          butorphanol, nalbuphine, and dezocine are not recommended
          as routine analgesics. Their dosing is limited by a
          ceiling effect, and they have a high risk of adverse
          effects. They must not be used if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is already
          taking a pure agonist opioid, as competition for the
          opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may cause a withdrawal syndrome.
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have good pain control on stable doses of
          an opioid, and are not experiencing adverse effects
          (especially drowsiness), it is safe to drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> in pain may have much poorer reaction times and
          may be a much greater risk.
          If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is unable to ingest an oral analgesic an
          alternate route of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> or an alternate opioid
          may be preferable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intramuscular</ENAMEX> injections are not
          recommended. Intermittent subcutaneous doses are just as
          effective, and much less painful.
          When changing routes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> or opioids, an
          equianalgesic table is a useful guide for initial dose
          selection. Significant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-pass metabolism necessitates
          larger oral or rectal doses to produce analgesia
          equivalent to parenteral doses of the same opioid.
          Equivalence dosing recommendations represent consensus
          from limited available evidence, so they are guides only.
          Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may require doses to be adjusted by
          more than a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to achieve effective analgesia
          without adverse effects (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          Opioids have common and uncommon adverse effects
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). While several may be a problem initially,
          pharmacological tolerance typically develops to all of
          the adverse effects except constipation within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
          Always caution <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to anticipate nausea
          and drowsiness for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few days</TIMEX> until tolerance
          develops. Provide antiemetics as needed. Prophylactic
          routine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stimulant laxatives</ENAMEX> should be prescribed.
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> misperceive that respiratory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> is a significant risk when prescribing opioids
          for pain. In fact, it is rare: pain is a potent stimulus
          to breath, somnolence always develops <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and
          pharmacological tolerance to respiratory depression
          develops quickly.
          The cost of opioid analgesics varies considerably.
          Adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analgesia</ENAMEX> can be achieved for the majority of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the least expensive opioids such as
          immediate-release preparations of morphine.
        
        
          Addiction
          It is a prevalent myth that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
          opioid analgesics for pain management causes addiction [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . Confusion about the differences between addiction,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tolerance</ENAMEX>, and physical dependence is in part
          responsible.
          The hallmark of opioid addiction is psychological
          dependence manifested by a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">behavioral syndrome</ENAMEX> of
          continued, compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, despite harm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> must be taken to differentiate a true addiction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> use disorder) from pseudo addiction due to
          under treatment of pain or other aberrant drug-related
          behaviors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          Pharmacological tolerance to analgesics (ie, the
          reduced effectiveness of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>), is not evidence of addiction, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and is rarely
          significant clinically. After an initial titration
          period, doses may remain stable for long periods (months
          to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>) if the pain stimulus remains unchanged. An
          increasing need for more analgesics more likely reflects
          progression of the symptom and underlying disease. On the
          other hand, tolerance to opioid adverse effects is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commonly</ENAMEX> observed, and is favorable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          Physical dependence, evidenced by the development of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">withdrawal syndrome</ENAMEX> when a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> is suddenly
          withdrawn, is not evidence of addition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Similar
          outcomes occur in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous hormones</ENAMEX> and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> that act through cellular receptors
          (eg, estrogens, beta-blockers, alpha-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> agonists,
          caffeine, etc.). Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will experience less pain,
          either spontaneously, or with changes in their underlying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. If the pain stimulus decreases or disappears,
          opioid doses usually can be reduced in decrements of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          or more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 2 to 3 days</TIMEX>, and finally stopped without
          causing a withdrawal syndrome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Depression
          It is a myth that persistent feelings of helplessness
          and hopelessness are inevitable and permanent
          consequences of advanced life-threatening illness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
          . Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a serious illness experience periods
          of intense situational sadness and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> accompanied by
          depressive symptoms. These feelings are usually present
          for a relatively short period (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>), and then
          resolve. However, in a variable number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, these
          feelings persist.
          The earlier depression is diagnosed, the more
          responsive to treatment it may be [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The most
          reliable symptoms of major depression in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          advanced illness are persistent dysphoria, anhedonia,
          feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and
          worthlessness, and loss of self-esteem [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . The
          somatic symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> (such as changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weight</ENAMEX>) are unreliable as they may reflect the underlying
          illness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The screening question, "Do you feel
          depressed most of the time?" is a highly sensitive and
          specific question in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Thoughts of
          suicide and requests to hasten death may be a marker of
          undiagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>.
          Treatment for depression may help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> feel better
          and have the energy and interest to achieve their final
          goals before they die. Approaches that combine supportive
          counseling and psychotherapy with antidepressant
          medication work best. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the health care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> can provide invaluable assistance to support the
          depressed patient, and his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
          When reversal of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> is an immediate short-term
          goal, a rapid-acting psychostimulant (such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylphenidate</ENAMEX>) is the best choice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . If a
          response in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 4 weeks</TIMEX> is acceptable, an atypical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antidepressant</ENAMEX> or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSRI</ENAMEX>) may be an appropriate choice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Tricyclic
          antidepressants have limited usefulness due to their long
          time to achieve therapeutic levels and risk of
          anticholinergic adverse effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . If the diagnosis
          is unclear, or the expected therapeutic response delayed,
          consult with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> with expertise.
        
        
          Anxiety
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> facing a life-threatening illness commonly
          experience anxiety over their fears and uncertainties
          about their future [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Compassionate exploration of
          the specific issues that are causing or exacerbating
          anxiety may be complex. Issues of grief and loss may be
          important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX>. Differentiate between primary
          anxiety and delirium, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, bipolar disorder, and
          medication side effects. Look for insomnia and other
          reversible causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> due to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, caffeine, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Input from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the interdisciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> may be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invaluable</ENAMEX>.
          Like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> often
          requires a combination of supportive therapy and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. Concerns about finances, family conflicts,
          future disability, dependency, and existential concerns
          will not resolve with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>. When it appears that
          pharmacological therapy will be beneficial,
          benzodiazepines are generally the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> class of
          choice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Intermediate</ENAMEX> half-life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (eg,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lorazepam</ENAMEX> or clonazepam) are commonly used.
          Benzodiazepines may worsen short-term memory,
          particularly in the elderly, or cause confusion in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with preexisting cognitive impairment. A few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will experience a paradoxical reaction to
          benzodiazepines, and their anxiety will get worse. When
          discontinuing benzodiazepines, taper them slowly to
          prevent rebound anxiety.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breathlessness</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyspnea</ENAMEX>)
          Breathlessness may be one of the most distressing
          symptoms for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and caregivers.
          Believing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s self report is the best way to
          assess it. Where possible, the underlying cause should be
          treated to at least provide symptomatic relief when the
          burden of the therapy does not outweigh the benefit.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> widely used medical approaches for the
          symptomatic relief of breathlessness: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, opioids,
          and anxiolytics. Nonpharmacological interventions may
          also contribute significantly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s and
          family's sense of well-being, and their ability to
          cope.
          The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who report breathlessness are
          not hypoxemic. Measures of hypoxemia (eg, pulse oximetry,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gas</ENAMEX> determination) do not correlate with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s self-report [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . This is not to
          say that such measurements may not be useful in
          understanding pathophysiology. However, the measurements
          frequently do not correlate with symptom relief. In
          addition, such measurements may be uncomfortable,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frightening</ENAMEX> and/or expensive, and divert the focus away
          from the symptom.
          While <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> will not reverse the cause of the
          breathlessness, a therapeutic trial of supplemental
          oxygen by nasal prongs may be beneficial. This may have a
          placebo effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . In addition, its effectiveness
          may be explained by the observation that cool air moving
          across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s face (eg, from compressed air by
          nasal prongs, or from a fan) may provide equal relief due
          to the stimulation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> cranial
          nerve [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] .
          Opioids may provide significant relief of the sense of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">breathlessness</ENAMEX> without having a measurable impact on
          their respiratory rate or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gas</ENAMEX> concentrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ]
          . Through both central and peripheral effects, doses
          lower than those used to relieve pain may be effective in
          opioid naïve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, subjective
          relief may also be associated with a measurable increase
          in exercise tolerance and mobility [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX> ] .
          Concerns that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> usage to manage symptoms will
          cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory depression</ENAMEX> or hasten death (ie, an
          unintended effect), or cause addiction are not relevant.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Opioid</ENAMEX> treatment for dyspnea is consistent with good
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>, ethical when the intent is to relieve
          suffering, widely accepted when standard dosing
          guidelines are followed, and very unlikely to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with abuse behaviors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . As with pain
          treatment, pharmacological tolerance is not a clinically
          significant issue.
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are breathless and anxious may also
          need treatment for their anxiety. Benzodiazepine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medications</ENAMEX> may be combined safely with opioids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Nausea</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vomiting</ENAMEX>
          A thorough assessment of the etiology and
          pathophysiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and vomiting is crucial as
          different causes will require very different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> organ systems - the gastric lining of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> tract, and the area postrema (the chemoreceptor
          trigger zone), the vestibular apparatus, and the cortex
          of the brain are important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] .
          The neurotransmitters dopamine, histamine,
          acetylcholine, and serotonin are important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of
          this symptom complex. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> can be demonstrated in the
          area postrema. Although all are present in the lining of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> tract, serotonin is particularly important.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acetylcholine</ENAMEX> and histamine are important in the
          vestibular apparatus. Nausea and vomiting that is
          mediated by the cortex is more complex and not associated
          with specific neurotransmitters (eg, the anticipatory
          nausea associated with chemotherapy).
          Dopamine-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> is probably the most
          frequently targeted for initial symptom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, even
          when the precise mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> is not known.
          Dopamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antagonist medications</ENAMEX> used to control nausea
          include the phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine) or
          butyrophenone neuroleptics (eg, haloperidol). Both have
          the potential to cause drowsiness and extrapyramidal
          symptoms, particularly in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] .
          Commonly used antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxyzine</ENAMEX>) also have anticholinergic properties. They
          may do "double duty" as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and cover both
          etiologies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opioids</ENAMEX> and anesthetics can trigger
          acetylcholine-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> in the vestibular
          apparatus. A pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticholinergic medication</ENAMEX> may be added
          to other antiemetics in empirical therapy, particularly
          when the vestibular apparatus is implicated (eg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scopolamine</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serotonin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> have been very effective in
          treating chemotherapy-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> (eg, ondansetron)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . They have been reported to be useful for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">refractory nausea</ENAMEX> of diverse types but are typically
          tried only when other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> have failed. They are
          expensive and should be promptly stopped if they are not
          effective after a short therapeutic trial.
          A "sluggish" or dyskinetic gut that does not empty
          properly (due to carcinomatosis, opioid therapy, other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medications</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> mellitus etc.) may be a source of
          nausea and vomiting in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advanced disease [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> ] . Constipation, a large liver producing a "squashed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stomach</ENAMEX>," ascites, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peritoneal disease</ENAMEX> may be causing
          pseudo-obstruction. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Medications</ENAMEX> with prokinetic effects
          (eg, metoclopramide) or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stimulant laxatives</ENAMEX> (eg, senna,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bisacodyl</ENAMEX>) may be effective at moving gut contents
          forward, and relieving the associated nausea [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] .
          Hyperacidity, with or without gastroesophageal reflux
          and/or gastric or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal erosions</ENAMEX>, may produce nausea,
          heartburn, acidity, or bitter taste that may be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with vomiting. Antacids, H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, or proton pump
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> may relieve the hyperacidity and/or reflux.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytoprotective</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (eg, misoprostol) may be effective
          in treating the nausea associated with mucosal erosion
          secondary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDs</ENAMEX>.
          Heterogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> that have unclear
          mechanisms of action, but uncontested benefits in some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> include glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cannabinoids</ENAMEX> (eg, tetrahydrocannabinol), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzodiazepines</ENAMEX> (eg, lorazepam) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61 62 63</NUMEX> ] .
          With complete obstruction, accumulation of
          intraluminal fluid from epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> is principally
          responsible for the symptoms of bloating, crampy
          abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Octreotide, a
          synthetic analog of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatostatin</ENAMEX>, selectively inhibits
          secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> and electrolytes into the gut lumen
          and may relieve these symptoms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64 65 66</NUMEX> ] .
          Refractory cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and vomiting often require
          combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> from different classes.
        
        
          Constipation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constipation</ENAMEX> is "the discomfort associated with
          reduced frequency of bowel movements" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] . If left
          unmanaged, it can lead to abdominal pain, bloating,
          nausea and vomiting, overflow incontinence, tenesmus,
          fecal impaction, or even bowel obstruction.
          As there is a wide range of "normal" in bowel habits,
          begin by assessing what the patient considers normal
          bowel function. Tailor examination, investigation, and
          treatment to the presentation, stage, and context of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. For most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> near the end of
          life, correction of the underlying pathophysiological
          cause of constipation is often not possible or
          appropriate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constipation</ENAMEX> should be expected during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">opioid</ENAMEX> treatment and prophylactic measures always be
          initiated from the outset as the condition is easier to
          prevent than treat [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] . Opioids cause constipation,
          but they are not the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> to do so. Other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> that may cause or exacerbate the problem are
          those with anticholinergic adverse effects (eg, tricyclic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antidepressants</ENAMEX>) and calcium-channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blockers</ENAMEX> (eg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verapamil</ENAMEX>).
          As a general measure, have the patient toilet
          regularly at the same time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>. Take advantage of
          the gastrocolic reflex that occurs after eating - the
          strongest peristalsis occurs in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Cathartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> classes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ]
          . For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, poor mobility, and
          decreased oral intake, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stimulant laxative</ENAMEX> (eg, prune
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX>, senna, casanthranol, or bisacodyl) is appropriate
          front-line therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX> ] . Osmotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laxatives</ENAMEX> (eg,
          magnesium salts, lactulose, sorbitol) may be added.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Detergent laxatives</ENAMEX> (eg, docusate) at conventional doses
          are only stool softeners, and are rarely effective when
          used alone for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end-</TIMEX>of-life. Prokinetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (eg, metoclopramide) added to the regimen may
          assist the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> whose constipation is
          refractory. A lubricant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stimulant</ENAMEX> (eg, mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>) may
          assist a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to defecate if the rectal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vault</ENAMEX> is full.
          Large-volume enemas that work by distending the colon to
          induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peristalsis</ENAMEX> and soften are not well tolerated by
          debilitated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          A frequent mistake is the failure to dose-escalate a
          particular cathartic. This leads to the sense that
          "nothing works" when, in fact, nothing has been tried to
          its maximal therapeutic dose. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habituation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at
          the end-of-life is rarely an important clinical
          concern.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fatigue/Weakness</ENAMEX>
          Fatigue/weakness is the most frequent distressing
          symptom associated with advanced illness and end-of-life
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> frequently focus on the
          symptom rather than its underlying cause. Many believe
          that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s strength is under his or her control, and
          feel that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is "giving up," "not fighting," or
          "not eating enough."
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> can play an instrumental role by educating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> about the nature of the symptom,
          and by giving the patient "permission" to rest. They can
          help decrease the pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or others
          exhorting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to be more alert, energetic, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conversant</ENAMEX>. Assistance from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may be
          instrumental.
          There are many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> approaches to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
          fatigue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . Help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to adapt
          activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living to promote energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiotherapy</ENAMEX> and occupational therapy can
          help with assessment, teaching, and assistive devices.
          Discontinue routine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> that are no longer
          appropriate near the end of life that may be making the
          fatigue worse (eg, antihypertensives, cardiac
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medications</ENAMEX>, diuretics, etc.).
          While fatigue/weakness is not easily treated
          pharmacologically, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> respond to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glucocorticoids</ENAMEX> (eg, dexamethasone) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 71 72</NUMEX> ] . While
          they can be continued until death, the effect may wane
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 to 6 weeks</TIMEX>. As long-term adverse effects are not
          a factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are at the end of their lives,
          there is no need to taper the dose if it remains
          effective. The psychostimulants (eg, methylphenidate) may
          also be effective [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symptom Management</ENAMEX> During <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Last Hours Of</ENAMEX>
          Life
          There are a variety of physiological changes that
          occur in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last hours</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of life. Each can be
          alarming if it is not understood. The most common are
          summarized here.
        
        
          Weakness and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatigue</ENAMEX>
          Weakness and fatigue usually increase as the patient
          approaches death. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may become almost
          completely still, and this need not be resisted. Most
          treatment to alleviate it can be discontinued. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joints</ENAMEX> may
          become uncomfortable if they are not moved [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] .
          Continuous pressure on the same area of skin,
          particularly over bony prominences, will increase the
          risk of skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemia</ENAMEX>, and pain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] . As the patient
          approaches death, provide adequate support and cushioning
          on the bed to lessen the need for uncomfortable
          turning.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessation of Intake</ENAMEX>
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> completely lose their appetite and stop
          drinking [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79 80</NUMEX> ] . This may heighten <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">onlookers</ENAMEX>'
          distress. However, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> feel that dehydration in
          the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last hours</TIMEX> of living does not cause distress and may
          stimulate the release of endorphins and anaesthetic
          compounds that promote the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> being
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81 82 83</NUMEX> ] . Low blood pressure or weak pulse is part
          of the dying process and not an indication of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydration</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who are not able to be upright do
          not get light-headed or dizzy. Meticulous oral, nasal,
          and conjunctival hygiene help to allay concerns overt
          patient thirst [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with peripheral edema or ascites have excess
          body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and are not dehydrated, though their
          intravascular volume may be contracted due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoalbuminemia</ENAMEX>. Parenteral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>, delivered either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intravenously</ENAMEX> or subcutaneously by hypodermoclysis, are
          sometimes considered, particularly when the goal is to
          reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delirium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX> ] . However, parenteral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> may
          have adverse effects that are not commonly considered.
          Intravenous lines can be cumbersome and particularly
          uncomfortable when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is cachectic, or has no
          discernible veins. Excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parenteral fluids</ENAMEX> can lead to
          fluid overload with consequent peripheral or pulmonary
          edema, worsened breathlessness, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>, and
          orotracheobronchial secretions, particularly if there is
          significant hypoalbuminemia.
        
        
          Loss of Ability to Swallow
          Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is unable to swallow, cease oral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>. Warn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregivers</ENAMEX> of the
          risk of aspiration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scopolamine</ENAMEX> or glycopyrrolate will
          effectively reduce the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . They will minimize or eliminate
          the gurgling from mucous buildup in the pharynx and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trachea</ENAMEX> and may be used prophylactically in the
          unconscious dying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anecdote</ENAMEX> suggests that the
          earlier treatment is initiated, the better it works, as
          larger amounts of secretions in the upper aerodigestive
          tract are more difficult to eliminate. However, premature
          use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who is still alert may lead to
          unacceptable drying of oral and pharyngeal mucosa. While
          atropine may be equally effective, it has an increased
          risk of producing undesired <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> and/or CNS excitation
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX> ] .
          If excessive fluid accumulates in the back of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">throat</ENAMEX> and upper airways, it may be cleared by
          repositioning or postural drainage. Oropharyngeal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suctioning</ENAMEX> is likely to be ineffective as secretions are
          usually beyond the reach of the catheter. Continued
          efforts to suction may only stimulate an otherwise
          peaceful patient, and distress family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who are
          watching.
        
        
          Neurological Changes
          The neurological changes associated with the dying
          process are the result of multiple concurrent
          irreversible factors. These changes may manifest
          themselves in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different patterns that have been
          described as the "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> to death" (See figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>
          ] . Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> follow the "usual road" that presents
          as decreasing level of consciousness and leads to coma
          and death.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terminal Delirium</ENAMEX>
          An agitated delirium may be the first sign to herald
          the "difficult road to death." These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> frequently
          present with confusion, restlessness, and/or agitation,
          with or without day-night reversal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX> ] . To the family
          and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregivers</ENAMEX> who do not understand it,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agitated</ENAMEX> terminal delirium can be very distressing.
          Although previous care may have been excellent, if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX> goes misdiagnosed or unmanaged, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          will likely remember a horrible death "in terrible pain"
          with cognitive impairment "because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>."
          It may be appropriate to evaluate and try to reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treatable</ENAMEX> contributing factors. However, if the patient
          is in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last hours</TIMEX> of his or her life with other
          concurrent signs of the dying process, the condition is
          by definition irreversible. Management appropriately
          focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the symptoms associated with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal delirium</ENAMEX> in order to settle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX> ] .
          When moaning, groaning, and grimacing accompany the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">agitation</ENAMEX> and restlessness, they are frequently
          interpreted as physical pain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90</NUMEX>). However,
          uncontrollable pain rarely develops or worsens during the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last hours</TIMEX> of life. Look for tension in the forehead,
          particularly for furrowing of the brow, as a clue that
          pain may be present.
          While a trial of opioids may be beneficial in the
          unconscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who is difficult to assess,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> must remember that opioids may accumulate and
          add to delirium when renal clearance is poor [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91 92</NUMEX> ] .
          If the trial of increased opioids does not relieve the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">agitation</ENAMEX>, or makes the delirium worse by increasing
          agitation or precipitating myoclonic jerks or seizures
          (rare), then pursue alternate therapies directed at
          suppressing the symptoms associated with delirium.
          Benzodiazepines are used widely to treat terminal
          delirium as they are anxiolytics, amnestics, skeletal
          muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">relaxants</ENAMEX>, and antiepileptics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">93</TIMEX> ] .
          Pre-dissolved oral lorazepam can be administered against
          the buccal mucosa and dose escalated to effect.
          Infusional benzodiazepines may be a rapidly effective
          alternative.
          Benzodiazepines may paradoxically excite some patients
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neuroleptic medications</ENAMEX>
          to control their delirium. Haloperidol given
          intravenously, subcutaneously, or rectally may be
          effective [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> ] . A more sedating alternative is
          chlorpromazine given intravenously or rectally [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbiturates</ENAMEX> or propofol have been suggested as
          alternatives for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who is particularly
          difficult to control [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 98</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Family <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Suffering Over Physiological Changes</ENAMEX>
          Changes in breathing patterns are frequent and can be
          distressing to the onlooker. Warn family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and
          caregivers about the breathing patterns that they may
          observe.
          Loss of sphincter control in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last hours</TIMEX> of life
          may lead to incontinence of urine and/or stool. Cleaning
          and skin care are important. A urinary catheter may
          minimize the need for frequent changing and cleaning,
          prevent skin breakdown, and reduce the demand on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregivers</ENAMEX>. However, it is not always necessary if urine
          flow is minimal and can be managed with absorbent pads or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surfaces</ENAMEX>. If diarrhea is considerable and relentless, a
          rectal tube may be similarly effective.
          Eyes that remain open can be distressing to onlookers
          unless the condition is understood. Advanced wasting
          leads to loss of the retro-orbital fat pad, and the orbit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">falls</ENAMEX> posteriorly within the orbital socket [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] . As
          eyelids are of insufficient length to both extend the
          additional distance backward and cover the conjunctiva,
          they may not be able to fully appose. Maintain moisture
          by using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ophthalmic lubricants</ENAMEX>, artificial tears, or
          physiological saline [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">100</ENAMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        A host of physical symptoms are common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        advanced life-threatening <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. If assessed, many can be
        relieved. We have summarized the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few</NUMEX>.
        The interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> will want to seek additional
        advice from some of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of information
        available. Symptom control is an essential, but not a
        complete, part of the core competencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in
        end-of-life care [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
