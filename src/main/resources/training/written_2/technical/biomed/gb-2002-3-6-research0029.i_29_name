        The scientific community has recently witnessed the
        publication of several large eukaryotic genomes in various
        stages of completion, including the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>],
        the nematode 
        Caenorhabditis elegans [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> fly 
        Drosophila melanogaster [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and the
        model plant 
        Arabidopsis thaliana [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Each of
        these genomes contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>
        attempt to study these genes more closely, the need for
        accurate gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> becomes increasingly apparent. For
        high-throughput genome sequencing projects, equally rapid
        high-throughput genome annotation is necessary, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioinformaticists</ENAMEX> use a variety of computational methods to
        generate this annotation. Despite many improvements in
        recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, these computational methods still fall short
        of producing correct models for every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>. In order to
        improve the annotation and facilitate further research, it
        is essential that we develop methods to identify genes
        correctly.
        Annotation of a gene model should include a precise
        description of where the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX> is
        transcribed into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">messenger RNA</ENAMEX>, the positions in the mRNA
        of any and all introns, and the translated protein sequence
        of the gene. If alternative splice variants are present,
        these should be annotated as well. Computational methods
        for genome annotation have several shortcomings that result
        in the following errors in annotation.
        Gene prediction programs predict exon boundaries
        correctly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 80%</NUMEX> of the time, even for the most
        intensively studied organisms [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. Thus a gene with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> will be completely correct <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of
        the time, and genes with more exons will be even less
        likely to be correct. Gene prediction programs also tend to
        merge and split gene models. Thus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> real genes may be
        merged into one predicted transcript, or vice versa. In
        addition, programs to align genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> often miss small exons, especially when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous proteins</ENAMEX> are not well conserved. Annotation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX> also tend to miss short genes. For example,
        recent work has shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encodes a short
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-120 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) protein similar to a secreted
        polypeptide ligand for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-like kinase that
        functions in meristems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Most of these were missed in
        the original, automated annotation of the 
        Arabidopsis genome. Alignment
        programs also make mistakes when genes occur in tandemly
        repeated copies. Finally, alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence to
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cannot predict untranslated regions (UTRs), and
        the leading 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio gene prediction programs
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genscan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GlimmerM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genemark</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]) have
        great difficulty predicting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>; most of them predict only
        the coding portion of a transcript.
        The solution to many of these problems is to identify
        the complete sequence of the transcribed portions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. Sequencing the mature transcripts (spliced mRNA)
        solves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major problems: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, it permits accurate
        identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, in
        conjunction with complete genomic sequence, it enables
        alignment software to identify the precise locations of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, it aids in the discovery of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX>-annotation of the Arabidopsisgenome
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> generated from the cDNA sequences were
          used to create new gene models for the corresponding
          genes in the 
          A. thaliana genome. Many of the
          genes have been manually curated, but many others were
          created by automated scripts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Manual curation is
          still ongoing.
          We used the cDNA alignments to create new gene models
          automatically according to the following criteria. As
          described above, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,918</NUMEX> cDNAs for which all
          alignment programs agreed on the positions of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX>. Using a majority voting scheme for the remaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> did not always give a correct answer, as
          discussed above, therefore we used these only after
          manual inspection. We assume the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding region is
          the longest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> on the forward strand, and required it to
          span <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 40%</NUMEX> of the cDNA length. This allowed us to
          create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,809</NUMEX> gene models automatically, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> cDNAs
          that were inspected manually to determine if they
          represent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA genes</ENAMEX>, pseudogenes or other types of
          sequence. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceres</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">104289</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding region was actually on the opposite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX>, corresponding to expressed protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">At2g23670</ENAMEX>, and
          Ceres: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20125</ENAMEX> matched the correct strand, supporting the
          gene annotation. (This could be explained in several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>: as an example of antisense-mediated translational
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on opposite strands,
          perhaps expressed in different cell types, or simply
          erroneous data.) In most of the other cases, the
          problematic cDNA is either an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA gene</ENAMEX> or a likely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogene</ENAMEX>.
          Using the alignments from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,809</NUMEX> gene models, we
          updated the annotation of the genome, and evaluated how
          this had changed the previous annotation. For the vast
          majority of genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> had not been annotated
          previously, and these were added with the incorporaton of
          the cDNA data. More interesting is how the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
          regions changed. Of the gene models, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,978</NUMEX> contained
          identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding regions to what had already been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> and required only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> refinements, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,591</NUMEX>
          were adjusted, yielding more accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>.
          Some of these contain very short 'micro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX>' that are
          usually missed by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio gene prediction programs.
          Perhaps most significant was the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>
          completely novel genes not previously included in the 
          Arabidopsis genome annotation. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX> novel genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> have significant homology to
          known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and the rest do not match any previously
          described <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In summary, we found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> of the
          matching gene models further validated the existing
          exon-intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for the gene, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> needed to be
          corrected, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> represented previously undiscovered
          genes.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro</ENAMEX>-exons
          We also used the cDNA alignments to detect
          'micro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX>', very short exons that are typically missed
          by both gene-finding programs and alignment algorithms.
          Using new software protocols we developed, we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro-exons</ENAMEX>, ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 25</TIMEX> base pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) in
          length, distributed evenly across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX>
          chromosomes.
          To find micro-exons, we analyzed the results of sim4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 5,016</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ceres</ENAMEX> cDNAs. Sim4 identified
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> cDNAs encoding exons of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 bp or less</NUMEX>. In an effort to
          identify additional micro-exons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sim4</ENAMEX> alignments
          containing imperfect intron-exon boundaries were
          examined. We selected only those cases with near-perfect
          alignments, requiring that all but one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> have
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> identity. We then checked to see if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-2</ENAMEX> exons
          with slightly lower identity were misaligned as the
          result of the presence of a small, undetected, exon. We
          used the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 bp</TIMEX> segments at the boundaries of the exon as
          probes. If these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> bp probes mismatched in the original
          alignment, we searched the adjacent intron (that is, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> identified by the initial alignment) for short
          exons that would produce a perfect match with the cDNA.
          We also required that any new exon would generate introns
          with a standard GT-AG consensus on either end. This
          procedure therefore yielded valid exon-intron structures
          that always improved the identity of the alignment
          between cDNA and genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Figure 1shows an example of
          the cDNA alignments before and after inserting a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>-exon.
          Using this method, we were able to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          additional micro-exons, all shorter than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 bp</TIMEX>. An
          extraordinarily short exon of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 3 bp</NUMEX> was identified,
          corresponding to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of disease-resistance gene 
          RAR1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">At5g51700</NUMEX>). A listing of
          these micro-exons from all chromosomes is shown in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Note that in some cases the length of the micro-exons
          is not a multiple of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>; for these, one of the
          preceding or following exons had its boundary realigned
          to maintain the reading frame. In comparison to the other
          alignment programs examined, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GeneSeqer</ENAMEX> proved to be
          highly competent in identifying micro-exons; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>-exons were identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneSeqer</ENAMEX> using the
          default settings. After lowering the minimum exon length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cut-off</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 bp</NUMEX>, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> were identified.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> indication that these micro-exons are correct (in
          addition to the identity with the cDNA) is that many of
          them are homologous to exons in other 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. For example, a
          search of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2001</TIMEX> revealed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>-exon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceres</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">118038</ENAMEX> is homologous to exons from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different cDNAs (accession numbers gi: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">15028118,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi:6683111, gi:14517549, gi:15027838</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gi</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">16974574</ENAMEX>).
          The consensus sequence of these exons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCCTAA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T/C</ENAMEX>)<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, has
          been previously characterized as a micro-exon in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato invertase gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Splicing anomalies
          Analysis of cDNA sequences can help to estimate the
          frequency of alternative splicing in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          Alternative splicing appears to be relatively common in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]; in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> this phenomenon has been
          less frequently observed, possibly as a result of the
          smaller collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> compared with mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Recently, some reports have appeared documenting
          a small number of cases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. We examined the
          alignments of cDNAs to the genome, looking for examples
          where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> aligned to overlapping locations
          on the same chromosome in such a way as to predict a
          different splicing pattern. The working hypothesis was
          that if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cDNAs mapped to the same locus, but presented
          distinct sets of exons, this would constitute evidence of
          alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX>, or possibly another type of
          splicing anomaly. We broadened the search for splicing
          anomalies by including in this protocol all the complete
          cDNAs available from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for</ENAMEX>
          Physical and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Research</ENAMEX> (RIKEN) collection
          described below. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,515</NUMEX> Ceres transcripts
          overlapped another transcript, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,129</NUMEX> overlapped
          a sequence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIKEN</ENAMEX> set.
          This protocol identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with apparent
          splicing anomalies, each of which was inspected manually.
          They fall into many different classes, representing
          different genetic events, as follows: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> alignments
          indicate an alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3</ENAMEX>' acceptor site for an intron;
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 alignments</TIMEX> indicate an alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> site for
          an intron; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> indicate that one or more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> remained unspliced. In some cases more than one
          intron was unspliced; for example, in one interesting
          case <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> intron was spliced in the RIKEN transcript
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi: 15146259</ENAMEX>), whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> were spliced from
          the corresponding Ceres transcript (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceres</ENAMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3992</TIMEX>,
          corresponding to gene At2g35520). These unspliced
          transcripts may arise from nuclear rather than mature
          cytoplasmic mRNA sequences. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six alignments</TIMEX> indicate that
          an internal exon is missing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> isoform; presumably
          the adjacent introns are spliced as a single intron
          containing the exon sequence. Fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> alignments
          suggest possible alternative transcription initiation
          sites. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of these transcripts, the putative
          initiation site was shifted far enough in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          direction to move past the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>, making it
          impossible to splice out the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intron, producing an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' exon in one of the transcripts. Many of the
          other transcripts contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more additional 5</NUMEX>'
          exons as a result of alternative initiation sites.
          Thirteen alignments suggest alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyadenylation</ENAMEX> (poly(A)) sites that affect splicing. The
          prediction of poly(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can be confounded by
          misannealing of the oligo(dT) primers used for reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>; for example, the presence of multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenines</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> can be mistaken for a poly(A)
          site. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Misannealing</ENAMEX> cannot explain the presence of
          unspliced intronic sequence found at the terminus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> transcripts, suggesting that these putative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are genuine and have an impact on splicing.
          We have found similar evidence for the occurrence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple poly</ENAMEX>(A) sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> experiments directed
          at cloning cDNAs from hypothetical genes. Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          alignments display multiple splicing anomalies, falling
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> of the categories above.
          Table 5lists many of these alternatively spliced
          genes; the complete list, with graphical and textual
          alignment data, is available on-line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] and is also
          provided as Additional data with this paper online.
          Figure 2highlights several interesting examples. In
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>, the alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3</ENAMEX>' splice site on the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intron</ENAMEX> leads to a shift in the reading frame, producing a
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>. In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX>, alignments of
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> indicate that the last intron is unspliced.
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2cshows</TIMEX> that different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' ends lead to differing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' introns and exons, while not changing the protein
          sequence in this particular example. Figure 2dshows a
          centrally located exon that is spliced out along with the
          surrounding introns. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2econtains three</NUMEX> different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'
          transcription start sites, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' termination
          sites, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unspliced introns in the middle
          transcript. The unspliced introns occur within exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">14335057</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in both the other transcripts. Note that some of
          the alternative splicing events occur within the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecotype</ENAMEX>.
          Neither collection of cDNAs can be considered a random
          sample of transcripts, and therefore the number of
          examples of alternative splicing discovered in this data
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of the overlapping transcripts) should
          not be used to extrapolate to the entire genome. The
          discovery of transcripts with different introns spliced
          out raises the question of whether the different spliced
          products are translated and whether the splicing
          differences reflect programmed developmental variation or
          simply splicing errors. It is not possible to answer
          these questions now, but incomplete splicing and
          consequential variants in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have been noted
          previously to be associated with gene silencing and were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postulated</ENAMEX> to reflect the regulated production of
          aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA products</ENAMEX> not destined to be translated [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>]. One clear conclusion is that alternative splicing
          can be discovered via analysis of cDNAs and genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and that a fuller collection of cDNAs will
          provide a valuable resource for more discoveries about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> and gene regulation.
        
        
          Are the sequences full-length?
          An independent project to sequence complete 
          Arabidopsis cDNAs is ongoing by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], using clones created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K.</ENAMEX>
          Shinozaki at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIKEN</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. These sequences are publicly
          available from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> (search for "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIKEN</ENAMEX> cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>"). These data provided the opportunity to
          compare the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of cDNAs and measure independently
          how many of them appear to cover the entire length of the
          predicted mRNA transcript. The sequencing of the RIKEN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNAs</ENAMEX> generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,996</NUMEX> sequences as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2001</TIMEX>; we
          compared these to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,016 cDNAs</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceres</ENAMEX> and found
          1,129 sequences that are contained in both data sets. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,129</NUMEX> sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">941</NUMEX> alignments yield the same
          exon-intron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for the underlying gene. We then
          asked, for each of the sequences containing identical
          introns, do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends match, and if not, how
          large is the difference? The results are illustrated in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          Several observations can be made about these results.
          First, it is important to note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceres</ENAMEX> clones were
          selected for full-length sequencing from among a large
          number of clustered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' sequences (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods), whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIKEN</ENAMEX> clones were sequenced on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end followed by clustering and selection of a clone
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequencing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. The methods for creating the
          full-length cDNA sequences at both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> involve
          multiple sequencing runs, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of the
          overlapping sequences. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we observed that in the
          Ceres data, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> appeared to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
          putative alternative transcription start sites. This
          became apparent when different cDNA assemblies were found
          to overlap exactly except for an extension on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more clones. It is interesting to note that
          when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIKEN</ENAMEX> clones were longer or shorter on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          end, clones of the equivalent length could often be found
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ceres</ENAMEX> collection. Multiple clones with the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          end provided strong validation that these were truly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of alternative transcription initiation
          sites or repeatable artifacts of the cloning process.
          Overall, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">397</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceres</ENAMEX> clones that were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 10</NUMEX> bp
          longer on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIKEN</ENAMEX> clones that were
          longer on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end. If alternative transcription
          initiation is the correct explanation, then it is
          relatively common. It is worth noting that in almost all
          cases, both alternative cDNAs contain complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          On the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceres</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIKEN</ENAMEX> databases each
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">316</NUMEX> sequences that were ><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 bp longer than</TIMEX>
          their match from the other set. If these represent
          alternative polyadenylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or stabilized ends of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that get polyadenylated, then these are quite common.
          Further investigation will be necessary to determine if
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of transcripts truly varies at such a high
          frequency.
          In summary, work described in this study on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> illustrates the utility
          of full-length cDNAs for finding alternative splice
          variants, short exons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX>, short genes and alternative
          transcription start sites. The annotation of eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> is currently an inexact and developing science,
          and the results described here demonstrate the power of
          full-length cDNA sequences for improving the quality of
          multiple aspects of genome annotation.
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Preparation and sequencing of cDNA
          Starting material for cDNA synthesis was polysomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          isolated from the top-most inflorescence tissues (ecotype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wassilewskija</ENAMEX>) and from roots (ecotype <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landsberg</ENAMEX> erecta).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from roots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landsberg</ENAMEX> erecta was used to construct
          the libaries because of the availability of high-quality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> parts inflorescence to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part root, as
          measured by wet mass, was used to make three
          size-fractionated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Because the ecotypes were
          mixed before library construction, we cannot determine
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> ecotype for any individual cDNA. Polysomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          was isolated from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX>-generated supernatant on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 M</ENAMEX> sucrose cushion. To capture full-length cDNAs, an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> is first attached to intact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' ends,
          taking advantage of the cap. After <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>- and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-strand synthesis, the full-length cDNAs were
          selected, size fractionated and cloned into pBluescript.
          The ligation mixture was transformed into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          selected on appropriate antibiotics and picked into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well microtiter plates. In repeated rounds of
          sequencing, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several tens of thousands</NUMEX> of clones from the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were sequenced from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> clustered, and the clone with the longest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          end in each cluster selected for complete sequencing.
          The number of clones sequenced in each round depended
          on the percentage of new full-length clones that could be
          obtained from each of the size-fractionated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. As
          the clones reported in this study came from
          non-normalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> rounds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          sequencing were employed; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,000</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59,000</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,000</NUMEX> in the final round.
          Following each round of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' sequencing, all sequences were
          clustered using a clustering algorithm that forms
          separate clusters if there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6</NUMEX> nucleotide
          differences in any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-nucleotide window of the match. In
          this way, clones would not fall into separate clusters
          simply because of ecotypic differences, different
          putative transcription start sites or sequencing errors.
          However, they would cluster separately if alternative
          splicing occurred in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 500</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6</NUMEX> nucleotides.
          Following clustering, the clone that was longest on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end was selected for full-length sequencing. If clones
          were of comparable length on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end, the clone to be
          sequenced was selected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> with the highest
          percentage of full-length clones. Sequencing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' ends
          was performed on capillary sequencers (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamics</ENAMEX>); full-length sequencing was done on ABI377
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencers</ENAMEX> using primer walking. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,016</NUMEX> clones
          analyzed in this study were selected from all full-length
          clones based on length (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 400 nucleotides</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-redundancy</ENAMEX> (eliminating alternatively spliced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clones</ENAMEX>), and length of the putative ORF relative to
          overall clone length.
        
        
          Alignment of cDNA sequences to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>
          thalianagenome
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> programs were used to align <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 5,016</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ceres</ENAMEX> cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to the 
          A. thaliana genome as follows.
          First, each program was used to align each cDNA sequence
          to the genome. Some programs cannot efficiently handle a
          search comparing a cDNA to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> eukaryotic
          chromosome, and to compensate for those programs, we
          created a modified procedure that first used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BLASTN</ENAMEX> to
          identify and extract a region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> surrounding
          the gene. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> was aligned to the corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          kb genome sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> programs with
          default parameter settings. The resulting alignments were
          then compared automatically to generate the comparison
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> appearing in the main text. The programs are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sim4</TIMEX>,
          available from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dds/gap2</ENAMEX>, available from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>];
          GeneSeqer, available from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]; and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">est_genome</TIMEX>,
          available from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were constructed by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recreating the
          cDNA sequence using the 
          Arabidopsis genome sequence,
          employing the longest alignment for which all programs
          predicted identical splice sites. The longest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> was
          identified along the forward strand of the cDNA followed
          by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding exon
          segments and untranslated regions of exons. These
          constructed gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were then compared to the
          existing gene annotation at the mapped genomic region.
          Previously annotated gene structures that disagreed with
          the cDNAs were replaced by the cDNA alignment-based gene
          models, and new gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were created where
          pre-existing gene annotations were lacking.
