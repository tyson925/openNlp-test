        Objects in nuclei recognized by antibodies specific for
        phosphoprotein epitopes, cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFs</ENAMEX>, or both, have
        been reported in glial and neuronal cells, 
        in situ and 
        in vitro . The nuclear structures
        appear spherical or rod-like and may have a positional
        relationship with nuclear pores [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Morphologically, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> appear similar to the
        nuclear "speckles" that are thought to be storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> splicing factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . However, while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament</ENAMEX> (IF) phosphoproteins could be
        components of nuclear speckles, they are immunologically
        distinct. Investigations of intermediate filaments (IF) in
        the nucleus have focused on lamins (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> for a
        current review) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , but many reports of 
        in situ nuclear localization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic IFs</ENAMEX> also exist, e.g., vimentin in association
        with nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in cultured fibroblasts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] , and an
        estrogen-sensitive cytokeratin association with nuclear DNA
        in human breast cancer cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        In a recent study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , using the SMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (mAB) to identify phosphorylated
        neurofilament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, reported discrete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> labeling
        within nuclei of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> neuroblastoma cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells
        are a subclone of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SK-N-SH</ENAMEX> human neuroblastoma cell line
        derived from neoplastic neural crest cells and under
        certain growth conditions, generate neuritic processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sternberger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sternberger</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] describe SMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        mAB as specific for phosphorylated epitopes on the heavy
        neurofilaments peptide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-H</ENAMEX>) and to a lesser extent medium
        neurofilament peptide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-M</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] has been
        characterized as recognizing phosphorylated epitopes on the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">210 kDa NF</TIMEX>-H <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptide</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , and used similarly to SMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        to identify neurites 
        in vitro and 
        in situ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would
        predict, therefore, that labeling with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RT97</TIMEX> would produce
        staining patterns, including nuclear, similar to those of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells.
        The nuclear localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> could
        be the result of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of phosphorylated NFs with
        nuclear components. Alternatively, it could be that lamins
        or other nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have a phosphorylated epitope
        also found on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFs</ENAMEX>. For example, Schilling 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] identified nuclear
        structures using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat glial</ENAMEX> nuclei 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] showed both SMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> strongly labeled nuclei of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NB2a</ENAMEX> neuroblastoma cells.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herrera</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] demonstrated nuclear localization patterns,
        similar to those obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , using rat glioma
        cells (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9L</NUMEX>) immunolabeled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J1-31</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX>, which appears
        to recognize a phosphorylated form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        These observations prompted us to further investigate
        nuclear antigens in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> neuroblastoma cells and to
        attempt to determine the relationship between these nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">objects</ENAMEX> and cellular growth dynamics. We asked the
        following questions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) are the immuno-labeled structures
        within the nucleus or just closely associated; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphoepitope</ENAMEX> labeled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> mABs specific to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFs</ENAMEX> or can it be identified on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFs</ENAMEX> in other cell
        types; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) is there a relationship between the cell
        cycle as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> and the amount of
        nuclear labeling by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX>?
      
      
        Results
        
          The immunolabeled structures are within the
          nucleus
          As visualized by confocal microscopy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and
          RT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mABs</ENAMEX> labeled discrete locations apparently within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> and revealed a filamentous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX>. (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>). The nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were
          clearly seen to be located seen within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nuclei</TIMEX> when
          visualized by confocal z-projections, and this location
          was confirmed by demonstrating mAB staining and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in
          single optical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 nm</NUMEX> thick. The nuclei were found
          to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 to 5 Î¼m</NUMEX> thick, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10 to 17</NUMEX> optical section
          thick. The nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were also found to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-localize with nuclear DNA using the co-localization
          function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bio-Rad LaserSharp</ENAMEX> software (data not
          shown). Therefore, within the limits of resolution of
          confocal microscopy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97 mAB</ENAMEX> label
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells that are inside the
          nucleus.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphoepitope</ENAMEX> labeled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> is
          not specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFs</ENAMEX>, and it can be identified on other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFs</ENAMEX> in other cell types
          SMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> labeled F98 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat glioma</ENAMEX> nuclei and cytoplasm
          with equal or greater avidity than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1D</NUMEX>). The cytoplasmic staining produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          was not distinguishable from that produced by anti-GFAP
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F98</TIMEX> glioma cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1F</NUMEX>). F98 glioma cells are
          not known to express neurofilament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-32</ENAMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> characterized as specific for non-phosphorylated NFs
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , stained the expected cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>) but did not label any
          structures in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F98</TIMEX> glioma cells (data not shown). Thus, it
          appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> recognizes a phosphoepitope that
          occurs on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-M, as
          previously reported (see the Discussion for other reports
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> staining glial cells 
          in situ ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> also labeled
          nuclear and cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">F98</NUMEX> cells (Figure
          1E).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electrophoretic</ENAMEX> and western analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> and
          F98 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extracts corroborated the finding that SMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          recognized an epitope on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFs</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cell extracts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-32</ENAMEX> lanes show
          strong labeling of bands corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-M.</ENAMEX> Additional bands, not seen in the SMI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> lane,
          are present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> lanes between and
          above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-M, and probably represent forms of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-M and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H with varying degrees of phosphorylation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> also revealed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> or closely spaced
          bands at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kDa which corresponds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> to the MW
          of lamins. Western analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-lamin</ENAMEX> B revealed a
          similar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in extracts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells, but no
          bands were labeled by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-lamin</ENAMEX> A/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Labeled</ENAMEX> bands below
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> kDa may represent degradation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> produced during
          cell extraction. Normal serum controls were negative
          (data not shown).
          Western analysis with anti-GFAP pAB, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX>, RT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>
          mAB, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-lamins</ENAMEX> mAB was performed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F98</TIMEX> cell
          extracts subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE. The anti-GFAP <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> shows
          a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at the expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX>, and multiple bands
          above it as well as minor bands below. The higher MW
          bands most likely represent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> multimers, while the
          lower MW bands are possibly degradation products.
          Multiple bands also appear in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and RT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lanes</ENAMEX>, although for the most part the antibodies do not
          appear to label the same bands. In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> labeled with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-lamin</ENAMEX> B, a weak but well defined
          band appears at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 70 kDa</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Controls
          (normal mouse serum) were negative (data not shown).
          Numerous putative phosphorylation motifs were
          identified in the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> and
          nuclear lamins A, B, and C when analyzed by the NetPhos
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">server</ENAMEX>, including a single tyrosine kinase motif, LNDRFAG
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y IDKVR</ENAMEX>, found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In addition,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> putative serine (= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> threonine (= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          other tyrosine (= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>) phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were
          identified; however, only the tyrosine phosphorylation
          site shown was shared among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> analyzed.
          Therefore it is possible that this sequence constitutes
          or contains the epitope recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mABs</ENAMEX>, and may account for the cross-reactivity of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> and the volume and intensity of
          nuclear labeling are related
          Analyses of nuclear labeling intensity and comparison
          to proliferation index as a function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in culture
          revealed a strong correlation. Comparison of nuclear
          labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells immuno-stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mABs</ENAMEX> to the culture proliferation index shows that
          nuclear labeling reached its greatest extent when DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> was also maximal. Both values fell as cells
          exited the cell cycle as indicated by lack of BrdU
          uptake, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 5</TIMEX>, when the cultures appear confluent,
          essentially all cell replication had stopped (see Figure
          1G,1H<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>Iand Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells immunolabeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> mAB
        demonstrated discrete nuclear localizations in nuclei with
        pronounced staining in neuronal processes and diffuse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> within cell bodies. Confocal microscopy
        demonstrated clearly that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> label structures
        within the nucleus. Comparison among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> that are
        specific for phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX>) and those
        not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-32</ENAMEX>, anti-GFAP) suggests that the nuclear
        structures are a phosphorylated IF. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> reactivity of
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> on glial cytoplasm and nuclei
        indicates the epitope is not cell type specific.
        Examination of western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and RT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>
        recognize, among others, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 - 74</NUMEX> kDa range
        in extracts of both neuroblastoma and glioma cells. Western
        analysis with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-lamin</ENAMEX> B labeled a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in the
        same extracts. The calculated molecular weights of lamins
        A, B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 74, 66</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> kDa,
        respectively; therefore, it seems most likely that lamins,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> all share a common motif that, when
        phosphorylated, is recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mABs</ENAMEX>. In
        support of this, a search for phosphorylation motifs among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> and lamins A, B, and C revealed a single, high
        probability tyrosine site that occurs once on each of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), further suggesting the possibility
        that this site constitutes or is contained within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> recognized by these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
        Based on the finding of a shared, tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> site, it seems likely that the nuclear
        structures reported in this and previous studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 12</ENAMEX> ]
        that employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> are phosphorylated lamins.
        Furthermore, nuclear labeling and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> synthesis appeared
        tightly associated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cultures, consistent with the
        suspected role of lamins in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Others
        have reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> labeling in glial as well as neuronal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX>. For example, Schilling 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] identified
        developmentally regulated nuclear antigens recognized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mAB</ENAMEX> in C6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> glioma cells 
        in vitro as well as glial and
        neuronal nuclei 
        in vivo , suggesting the presence
        non-neurofilament epitopes. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , in a study of
        neurite outgrowth from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NB2a</NUMEX> cells, showed that both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> mABs strongly labeled nuclei of
        undifferentiated cells, and the nuclear labeling declined
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> progressed. These results are similar to
        the results reported here. In a recent paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> was described
        as labeling nuclear epitopes in cells in culture and in
        neurons of mature rat brain as visualized by
        cryo-sectioning and confocal microscopy. However, in light
        of the findings reported here, the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> reported
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glass</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> in rat brain sections may have
        been in mitotically active glial cells as well as in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>.
        Although these nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">epitopes</ENAMEX> appear similar to
        nuclear speckles, the latter have not been reported as
        IF-associated structures, but rather storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        processing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, for a current, brief
        review [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ). However, as it is know that lamins are
        involved in nucleo-skeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> replication sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , it would not
        be unexpected to find lamins associated with nuclear
        speckles, perhaps as structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> may recognize the phosphorylated
        tyrosine motif, LNDRFAG 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y IDKVR</ENAMEX>, which occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-H and
        thus provides the basis for the claim of these antibodies
        being specific for phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . However,
        this same motif occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> and lamins A, B, and C and
        possibly other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and is not restricted to neurons
        as shown by the glial staining reported here and in other
        studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It would be interesting to look at nuclei
        from a variety of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> using these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> as
        probes.
        In this study and in previous studies performed in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 19</ENAMEX> ] , a close relationship between the
        nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphoepitopes</ENAMEX> and growth phase has been reported.
        Because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of phosphorylated lamins with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and the cell cycle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , and the sharing
        of phosphoepitopes among lamins, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>, it seems
        most probable that the nuclear epitopes revealed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroblastoma</ENAMEX> and glioma cells by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-97</ENAMEX> are

          All culture reagents were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>, unless otherwise noted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells were
          maintained in culture as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
          Initial cell density was determined using a hemacytometer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) and diluted

          comparative purposes in this study, and were cultured as
          described for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX> cells.

          Confocal Microscopy
          Cells grown on coverslips were washed briefly in a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute</TIMEX> or at room temperature in
          a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> (PFA) solution freshly made from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraformaldehyde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron Microscopy Sciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ft.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) and buffered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>
          Tween-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBST</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> washes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS/PBST</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> each. As a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          had suggested nuclear staining by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> targeted to
          cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> might be fixation dependent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] or
          an artifact of fixation, we did a preliminary comparison
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SMI-31</ENAMEX> labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> vs. paraformaldehyde fixed
          cells. We found minor differences in the staining pattern
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> and paraformaldehyde fixed cells, but
          immuno-labeled nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were visible regardless
          of fixation. No differences in the localization of mAB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in the cells was noted when comparing between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods of fixation.
          After fixation the cell-bearing coverslips were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> non-fat powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> to block
          non-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at
          room temperature. The coverslips were then washed 3
          times, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> each, and incubated with the desired
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-24 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. The
          cells were again washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>
          each) and incubated with the appropriate secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at room temperature.
          During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final 30 minutes</TIMEX> of secondary antibody
          incubation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î¼l</NUMEX> of TO-PRO-3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-3605</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>, OR), a DNA specific probe was added for
          identification of nuclei (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Negative controls for
          all immuno-preparations were prepared by use of the
          appropriate normal serum in place of the primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. The coverslips were then mounted on glass
          slides in a medium consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> glycerol in water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine</ENAMEX>, and stored at
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20Â°C</NUMEX> in the dark.

          An Olympus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> fitted with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad MRC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1024</TIMEX>
          confocal scanhead via the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> port was used for all
          image acquisition. Initial image processing was done
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bio-Rad LaserSharp</ENAMEX> software running on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> PC;
          final processing and printing of images was done using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Photoshop</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> software.
          Culture dynamics were determined for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SH-SY5Y</ENAMEX>
          neuroblastoma cells at an initial density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> Ã <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4cells/cm 2</ENAMEX>. Cells were introduced into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five 25</NUMEX> cm
          2flasks, then harvested from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> flask <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ml Puck</ENAMEX>'s saline solution (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.4</NUMEX> mM

          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.8 mM</NUMEX> EDTA). Detached cells were pelleted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> rpm
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> in a clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centrifuge</ENAMEX> and resuspended in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. Cell density was determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> by
          counting the number of cells present in representative
          samples using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-chambered hemacytometer. A
          proliferation index was calculated as the percentage of
          nuclei present engaged in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX>, using BrdU
          uptake as an indicator (see part D below for BrdU
          labeling method; also see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          Quantitation of fluorescent labeling was performed on
          confocal images collected using calibrated microscope
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> settings for cells grown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-5 days</TIMEX>. All images
          were collected from cells stained at the same time with
          the same batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Thus any differences in
          staining intensity and area stained were expected to be a
          function of time in culture and/or culture density. This
          entire process was performed in duplicate.
          Confocal stacks were projected and then imported into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Image 1.6</ENAMEX> software (freeware at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://rsb.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">info</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/nih-image/</ENAMEX>). Density slice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filtering</ENAMEX> was used to remove background autofluorescence
          and then record the area stained in each nucleus in the
          flattened image. Intensity values above background were
          also determined, but not used as they were found
          insensitive to growth conditions and more sensitive to
          nuclear thickness (the number of optical sections in the
          projected stack) than to experimental parameters. The
          area per nucleus stained is not affected by the number of
          sections in the projected stack, and was significantly
          related to culture conditions. These data were used to
          relate nuclear area stained to time in culture.
          Statistical analysis was done using linear regression and
          single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA).

          volumes adjusted so that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were
          loaded into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of a discontinuous (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> separating, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stacking</ENAMEX>) polyacrylamide gel. Gels were prepared in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicate</ENAMEX> and one of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> stained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue
          and the other used for electrophoretic transfer onto a
          nitrocellulose membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA). The
          identities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> bound to the nitrocellulose
          membrane were revealed using the appropriate primary and
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2</ENAMEX>). Molecular weight
          values were determined by calculating Rf ratios as the
          distance from the bottom of the well to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> band
          of interest divided by the distance from the bottom of
          the well to the dye front. Standard curves were developed
          using log <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> standards versus Rf ratio of
          those standards. Apparent molecular weights of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          identified by western blot analysis were determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extrapolating MW</ENAMEX> from the standard curve using measured
          Rf ratios.
