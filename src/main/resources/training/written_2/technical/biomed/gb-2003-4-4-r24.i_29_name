        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> locus (MIM *<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">191160</NUMEX>) has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with susceptibility to a wide range of
        infectious and inflammatory diseases, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>,
        typhoid, leishmaniasis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">meningococcal sepsis</ENAMEX>, trachoma,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX>, and inflammatory bowel disease
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . Thus far, these associations
        have not been mapped in any detail, and as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> lies in the central part of the
        major histocompatibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (MHC), there are many
        candidate genes that could potentially be responsible. A
        strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> is 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> itself, as it encodes the potent
        pro-inflammatory cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>, and there is a significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of clinical and experimental data suggesting a causal
        role for it in the pathogenesis of many of the diseases
        with which it has been associated. Furthermore, most of the
        reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> are with polymorphisms located in the
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region, and cellular
        studies of gene regulation 
        in vitro suggest that the molecular
        basis of the disease association maybe, at least in some
        cases, a direct effect of the polymorphism on levels of
        gene expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        To pursue the causal origin of these 
        TNF disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> we must
        begin with a detailed understanding of the allelic
        associations between different 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TNF SNPs</ENAMEX>. This is particularly
        important considering that within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few hundred</TIMEX> base pairs,
        there are several potentially functional polymorphisms
        which show apparently independent disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with
        severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Alternatively, these 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF SNPs</ENAMEX> may be serving as neutral
        markers of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> elsewhere in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central MHC</ENAMEX>. In order to understand, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, how the 
        TNF SNPs relate to each other, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> are the best markers of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> locus in general, we applied two
        new analytical techniques to our haplotypic data. The
        first, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> efficiency analysis (AEA), precisely
        defines the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> at
        every other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> in a case-control scenario. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX>, entropy maximization method (EMM), selects those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that most effectively dissect the underlying
        haplotypic structure of a locus. The results of these
        analyses allow us to prioritize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> for genotyping in
        future <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-association studies.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Allele frequencies for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> are listed in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> genotypic data had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">354/2,544</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>) sites
          where gametic phase was unknown, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> data
          had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">188/1,008</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> where gametic phase was
          unknown. Where available, genotypes from offspring of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> were used to phase these data (using the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHAMILY</ENAMEX>), which reduced the number to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">127/2,544</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>)
          phase-unknown sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> dataset and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75/1,008</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) phase-unknown sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were pooled and the program PHASE was then used to
          assign the remaining phase-unknown sites. After inferring
          haplotypes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 6/2,544</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>) phase assignments were
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> certain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> dataset, and only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/1,008</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>) phase assignments were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 90%</NUMEX>
          certain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX>. All other assignments
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121/2,544 and 73/1,008</NUMEX>) were greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> certain.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">424</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gambian</ENAMEX> haplotypes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> haplotypes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were the basis of subsequent analyses
          reported.
        
        
          Haplotype distributions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> sample, we observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> different
          haplotypes, and the distribution was dominated by one
          major haplotype (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.0%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.7%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.5%</NUMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Thirteen haplotypes of low frequency
          made up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">another 28%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of alleles were singletons
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">haplotypes</ENAMEX> observed only once in the sample). The gene
          diversity, or probability that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> haplotypes chosen at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> from the sample are different, was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.80</NUMEX> (standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (SD) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>). There is one nonrecombinant
          haplotype that is found only in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> sample included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> different haplotypes,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of which were shared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> population
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The predominant haplotype in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>
          was not as common, at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.0%</NUMEX>, and there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other
          haplotypes with frequencies <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 10%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.2%</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.1% and 10.1%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Haplotype 9</ENAMEX>, bearing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-1031C</NUMEX> and
          -863A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX>, is much more common in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> than in The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gambia</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.1%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4%</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> percent of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were present as singletons. The gene
          diversity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> was slightly greater at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.85</NUMEX> (SD
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>'s 
          F statistic reveals differences
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> by calculating the reduction in
          heterozygosity that is expected after random mating
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX>
          populations the 
          F 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.021</NUMEX>. Permutations of the data under a null
          hypothesis of no differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
          gives a probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>. An exact test of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population differentiation</ENAMEX> finds the observed haplotype
          distributions to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> fit of a model of random
          mating between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, with a
          probability <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 -5</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Recombination
          Results of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-gamete test on pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> reveal that in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19/66</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>)
          pairs of loci have all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> possible haplotypes present;
          while in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15/55</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>) pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> have all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          haplotypes present (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">high-frequency</ENAMEX> (and
          presumably older) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> show evidence of recombination in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TNF-3025, TNF-1031</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Gambia</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-308 SNP</ENAMEX> shows evidence of recombination with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, the TNF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">244</NUMEX> shows evidence of
          recombination with many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-863 SNP</ENAMEX>, of relatively high frequency in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>,
          shows no evidence of recombination with any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> sample. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> haplotypes of frequency
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> are represented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2with</NUMEX> dotted
          lines. Although the branching structure of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> genealogy is similar in both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, there are unique recombination events that
          have differentiated the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (haplotypes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 20</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, there appear to be more recombinant
          haplotypes of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 1%</NUMEX> frequency.
        
        
          Linkage disequilibrium
          Consistent with the evidence for recombination,
          linkage disequilibrium is variable across the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> locus (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c,4</NUMEX>d) and
          generally low. Values of pairwise linkage disequilibrium,
          
          r <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, are different between the two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, though well correlated ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Gambia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> pairs have the minor alleles in the repulsion phase,
          while in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> pairs are in the repulsion
          phase. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> pairs in the repulsion phase have
          very low linkage disequilibrium ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>). There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that are in the coupling phase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX>
          sample, but are in the repulsion phase in The Gambian
          sample, reversing the allelic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. Most of these
          occasions involve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-244A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX>, which is found on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> haplotype in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX> (in phase with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-3025G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX>), but on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different haplotypes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> efficiency analysis
          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods) we
          calculate the apparent relative risk at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> marker given
          a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second marker</TIMEX> for all pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>. As an example, we assign a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-376A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> (this is the relative risk of the
          A allele compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> allele) and calculate the
          relative risks at all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene using
          the haplotype frequencies from The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Log
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the relative risk is plotted on
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y -axis</ENAMEX>, so values above the 
          x -axis correspond to disease risk
          while values below the 
          x -axis correspond to disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX>. We find that the relative risk varies greatly
          across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene region. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that are in
          maximum positive linkage disequilibrium ( 
          D ' = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-376A</ENAMEX> show
          relative risks of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-376A</ENAMEX> gives a
          relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in the TNF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> would have a relative risk between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX> when
          the relative risk at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-376A</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for all pairs of markers are given in Figure
          4a,4<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">b. Hypothetical disease</ENAMEX> alleles are given along the 
          x -axis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker alleles</ENAMEX> are
          given on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">y -axis.</ENAMEX> Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> indicates the
          apparent relative risk ( 
          R ) of a marker on the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -axis when the hypothetical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease allele</ENAMEX> indicated on the 
          x -axis has a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          Using an arbitrary cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> < 
          R <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 2.0</NUMEX> (indicated by blue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>), some markers perform poorly: for example in The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gambia TNF-308</ENAMEX> can only detect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-3025</ENAMEX> ( 
          R = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>). Interestingly, if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-308 SNP</ENAMEX> were a disease allele, most of the other SNPs
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> would show a moderate protective effect. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TNF-1031</ENAMEX>
          is good at detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, the pattern of association efficiency is
          different, and generally stronger. Most hypothetical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease SNPs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> would be detectable by other SNPs
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>, with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">476</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-1073</ENAMEX> which
          have very low frequency and little prospect of being
          detected by other markers.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> efficiency analysis compared to linkage
          disequilibrium
          To illustrate the relationship between the association
          efficiency parameter and measures of linkage
          disequilibrium, we plot the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of relative risk for all pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> (when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> is assigned a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>)
          against 
          r 2(Figure 6a,6b). Above the 
          x -axis, 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2appears</TIMEX> to be correlated with
          the association efficiency parameter (correlation
          coefficients of 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.77</NUMEX> in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX>, and 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.91</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>). Below the 
          x -axis, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">marker SNP</ENAMEX> gives
          an apparently protective effect, the correlation is not
          as strong ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.61</NUMEX> in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX>, 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.60</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>). In this
          situation where minor alleles are in the repulsion phase,
          the values for 
          r 2remain low even when association
          efficiency parameter shows a strong protective
          effect.
          The association efficiency parameter is correlated
          with 
          D , the un-normalized linkage
          disequilibrium parameter (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6c,6</NUMEX>d). When the
          absolute value of 
          D is great, the association
          efficiency tends to be high; however, many SNP pairs also
          have high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> efficiency even when the absolute
          value of 
          D is low.
          When we plot the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> efficiency parameter
          against the normalized disequilibrium parameter, 
          D ', we see a strong positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">correlation:</ENAMEX> 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX> and 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.91</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> (Figure 6e,6f).
          Linkage disequilibrium is necessary to detect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>; however, it is not sufficient. Despite 
          D ' = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, some pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> are
          poor markers of each other, showing relative risks
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> when the linked hypothetical disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> gives a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Entropy maximization method
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entropy</ENAMEX> ( 
          E ), a measure of haplotypic
          diversity, was calculated for the full <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-SNP haplotypes
          in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> sample, 
          E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.95</NUMEX>; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> sample, 
          E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.23</NUMEX>. To determine if a subset
          of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> SNPs could account for most of the haplotypic
          diversity in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, we calculated entropy for all
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subsets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, increasing the number of SNPs
          in a subset from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 12</TIMEX>. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7we</NUMEX> plot the subsets
          of markers with maximum entropy. We begin with a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>, and with each additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNP</ENAMEX> we include, the entropy
          increases. The entropy plateaus when the additional
          markers contribute little additional information. To
          account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the haplotypic diversity of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> , one must genotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Gambian</ENAMEX> sample (in order of decreasing

        Discussion
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> locus has been associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to a wide range of infectious and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory diseases</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, three 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter SNPs</ENAMEX> have been
        independently associated with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . To
        better understand these complex genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, we have defined the haplotypic structure of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene region using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> SNPs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyped</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">212</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Gametic
        phase was determined by genotyping one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> from each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adult</ENAMEX> (when available), reducing the number of
        phase-unknown sites by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>. The gametic phase of the
        remaining sites was determined by statistical inference.
        This integration of family- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based methods of
        haplotype reconstruction resulted in phase assignments of
        high certainty. This description of the pattern of DNA
        sequence variation provides insight into the genetic
        differentiation of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, the
        evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene itself, and the suitability of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> to serve as markers of disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        There are a number of interesting features that
        distinguish these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> at the haplotypic level.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haplotypes</ENAMEX> are unique to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> sample, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> are unique to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> sample. The haplotype
        bearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-857T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> was not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> (this
        site is not polymorphic in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> sample), whereas it
        has a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.2%</NUMEX> in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX>. When population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> is assessed by haplotype instead of by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual SNP</ENAMEX> frequencies, we observe a greater value for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>'s fixation index, 
        F 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> 
         = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.021</NUMEX>, compared to 
        F 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> 
         = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX> for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF SNPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Intragenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX> seems to have had an important role in
        diversifying the locus and in distinguishing the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>-specific recombinant haplotypes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 20</TIMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>). In spite of the significant differences in haplotype
        distributions between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, it
        appears that most of the haplotypes have evolved over a
        period of time during which there was gene flow between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sampled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. That is, the basic branching
        structure of the gene genealogy is the same in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, although frequencies are different and there
        appear to be population specific recombination events
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Our results have some similarities with a report of
        haplotype <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> across <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 megabases</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) in a sample of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorubans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In a haplotype
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> defined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> haplotypes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 5%</NUMEX>
        frequency were found; we find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> with frequency <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 5%</NUMEX>. However, we find
        that a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and 10</NUMEX> haplotypes make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the
        sample in The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, respectively, while they
        report an average minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> haplotypes. Furthermore,
        they report values for 
        D ' that are constant across a
        haplotype block, while we find variability in linkage
        disequilibrium, even over short distances. Our data are
        more consistent with previous reports of haplotypic
        structure where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> were ascertained by resequencing in a
        large sample of chromosomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        The increased frequency of haplotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the Gambian
        sample has a profound impact on the allelic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> as evaluated by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test or as defined
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pairwise association</ENAMEX> efficiency parameter. The
        'star-shaped' genealogy of the Gambian 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> locus, dominated by one central
        haplotype with many derived haplotypes defined by single
        mutational events, produces negative disequilibria between
        most pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> (the rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alleles</ENAMEX> are found in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repulsion</ENAMEX> phase). The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test has low power to
        detect negative disequilibria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ; this may explain why
        in the case where 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p > 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">41/42 SNP</ENAMEX> pairs have
        negative disequilibria. The ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> marker to detect
        another in a case-control scenario is also greatly reduced
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> are in the repulsion phase. For example, in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> sample, allele pairs in the repulsion phase are
        much more likely to be inefficient markers (where
        inefficient means the apparent relative risk at the marker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> is betwen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> when the relative risk of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypothetical disease</ENAMEX> SNP is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) than alleles in the
        coupling phase ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p < 10 -7</ENAMEX>).
        Although linkage disequilibrium between a disease
        susceptibility locus and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker locus</ENAMEX> is required to
        detect an association with a complex disease, for a fixed
        sample size, it may not be sufficient. Even in the extreme
        case when linkage disequilibrium is at its theoretical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maximum</ENAMEX> ( 
        D ' = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> and no recombination has
        occurred between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>), the relative risk at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> locus will be some fraction of the relative risk at
        the disease susceptibility locus, unless the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alleles
        have the same frequency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Using the relationship
        defined in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Equation 2</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods), we can
        examine the haplotypic structure of a candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> and
        assess the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> marker to detect a disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> when a second marker contributes a given
        disease risk. We calculate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> values of apparent relative
        risk for each pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> (assigning each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> in turn a
        hypothetical risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) and plot them against 
        D ' (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        Pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> where 
        D ' values are reversed between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> also show a reversal of the relative risk (that
        is, relative risks greater than 1 become less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For
        example, if the risk at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP TNF</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">851</NUMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, then the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neighboring SNP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">467</NUMEX>, would give a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gambian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the effect would
        be protective with a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>. This suggests
        that even with a marker in close physical proximity to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease-susceptibility SNP</ENAMEX>, results may differ greatly and
        even give apparently contradictory results between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. This illustrates the importance of identifying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>-specific recombinant chromosomes in the study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. We identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that would
        reverse relative risks (that is, reverse the sign of 
        D ) between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> efficiency parameter is
        correlated with 
        D ' ( 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX> for combined data), it is
        interesting to consider the situation where 
        D ' = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX> between the marker and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypothetical disease</ENAMEX> SNPs. In this situation, the apparent
        relative risk at a marker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> may be considerably lower
        than at the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> SNP (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This is especially
        evident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. These observations
        suggest that linkage-disequilibrium measures, as summarized
        by 
        D ', may not accurately reflect the
        ability of a marker to detect a disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        It is troubling to observe that even within a relatively
        small gene like 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.3 kb</NUMEX> in this study) the SNP
        markers are poorly correlated: if a true
        disease-susceptibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> existed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene, many
        of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> would be inefficient markers of that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease allele</ENAMEX>. Our calculations reveal that even if a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypothetical disease</ENAMEX> allele gave a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increased risk,
        out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX> possible pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> of them (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>),
        the marker would show a relative risk of less than twofold.
        Only a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> pairs are efficient enough to
        detect a strong disease-modifying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene region.
        Although it appears that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> are poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> of each other,
        it is important to ask which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> serve as good markers of
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> haplotypes. Depending on the
        haplotypic structure of a gene region, one may be able to
        choose a small subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that capture most of the
        haplotypic diversity, thus reducing the cost of genotyping
        significantly with only modest reductions in information [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> methods have been reported that select the
        best subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 23</NUMEX> ] . In this paper we introduce
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>, the entropy maximization method (EMM), which
        chooses the subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that explains the largest
        proportion of the underlying haplotypic diversity as
        measured by entropy.
        The single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> with maximum entropy is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> with
        frequency closest to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX>, in this case TNF-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3025</TIMEX>. In both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> of the
        haplotypic diversity. With the addition of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> SNP to
        form a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-SNP haplotype, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> of the haplotypic
        diversity is accounted for. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Gambia</ENAMEX>, it is most
        informative to include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-308 SNP</ENAMEX> as a second marker,
        whereas in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-1031</ENAMEX> SNP contributes the most as
        a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> marker. It is not surprising that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> selected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMM</ENAMEX> are those that have frequencies
        closest to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX>; however, the addition of a common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNP</ENAMEX> that
        is well correlated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> already in the subset will
        contribute little additional information.
        For example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambian</ENAMEX> sample, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> are selected first by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMM</ENAMEX> (TNF-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3025</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>), TNF-308
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">851</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-1031</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>)). The next most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1304</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-863</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>); however,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMM</ENAMEX> does not choose these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNPs</ENAMEX> next because the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1304</TIMEX> tends to occur in phase with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">851</NUMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-863</ENAMEX> tends to occur in phase with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-1031</ENAMEX>, both of
        which are already in the subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>. So the next
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> choices that maximize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entropy</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-857</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">467</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, which, although less common, represent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> previously unaccounted for (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 8</NUMEX>). These
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-SNP haplotypes now represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 90%</NUMEX> of the
        haplotypic diversity. Two more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNPs</ENAMEX> must be added (for a
        total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>) before <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-SNP haplotypic
        diversity is accounted for.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, the general features of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker</ENAMEX> selection are
        the same, though the optimal SNPs are different. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> most common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SNPs</ENAMEX> are selected first by the EMM
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-3025</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TNF-1031</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">851</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>)), followed
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-308</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1304</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, population-specific recombinant haplotypes
        make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>+<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1304</TIMEX> SNP more informative in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>; it is
        required to resolve haplotypes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 4 and haplotypes 21</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>, which together make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 10%</NUMEX> of all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> must be included to
        represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-SNP haplotypic diversity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMM</ENAMEX> is especially useful when combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEA</ENAMEX>. The
        latter can be used to determine how well the recommended
        haplotype-tagging SNPs detect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> at a particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">candidate SNP</ENAMEX>. The results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEA</ENAMEX> can then be used to
        adjust the power of an association study accordingly.
        Analysis of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> locus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        reveals a haplotypically diverse locus where markers are
        only weakly associated with each other. Although initial
        detection of a disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> may be difficult, weak allelic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> within the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene region will make it possible
        to distinguish a disease-modifying SNP from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>.
        Future studies may determine that this is a general feature
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Subjects
          Healthy unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> were recruited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Banjul</ENAMEX>, The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gambia</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blantyre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>. All were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who presented to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> gave informed consent and the study was
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gambia Government/Medical Research</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council Joint Ethical Committee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine Research Committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>.
          After excluding erroneous pedigrees, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">187</NUMEX>
          parent-child pairs plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> comprised the
          Gambian sample (a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">212</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
          parent-child pairs plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>) comprised the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> sample. We also studied
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX>, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gorilla</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> orang
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utans</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          SNP identification and genotyping
          In a previous study, we described the nucleotide
          diversity of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> locus in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> healthy, unrelated
          Gambian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . There we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> by
          forward and reverse sequencing of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> gene
          from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1,389</NUMEX> bp relative to the start of transcription to
          +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,004</NUMEX> bp on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX> chromosomes. Here we have genotyped the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> identified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> , plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> in the
          neighboring gene, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LT</ENAMEX> α, in a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">212</NUMEX> Gambian
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malawian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. The amplification refractory
          mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) was used to genotype the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> identified by sequencing. Methods are as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The accuracy of the
          ARMS-PCR method was tested on sequenced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          before extending it to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> of unknown
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Haplotype construction
          For most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, genotypes were available
          from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, raising the question of how to
          construct haplotypes most efficiently from a dataset
          where pedigree information is available for some but not
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. We developed a program PHAMILY, which
          uses information from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-generation pedigrees to
          construct parental haplotypes at all unambiguous sites.
          These partial haplotypes of unambiguous sites serve as
          input for PHASE [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] , which uses the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephens-Donnelly</ENAMEX> method of haplotype construction to
          assign the remaining phase-unknown sites among the
          unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were pooled
          before haplotype construction; after haplotype
          construction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were assigned to their original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> on the basis of their sample identifiers.
        
        
          Population genetic analyses
          
            Estimating gene diversity
            An estimate of gene diversity ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> ), the probability that two
            randomly chosen haplotypes are different in a sample,
            was calculated using Equation <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.5</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nei</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ,
            
            where 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the number of gene copies in
            the sample, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is the number of different
            haplotypes, and 
            p 
            
              i 
             is the frequency of the 
            i th haplotype. The sampling
            variance of this estimate was calculated according to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roychoudhury</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The computer software
            Arlequin was used to perform these calculations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX>
            ] .
          
          
            Construction of haplotype networks
            Network2.oc was used to construct median-joining
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of the haplotypic data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Because of the
            occurrence of many low-frequency recombinant haplotypes
            in the dataset, only haplotypes observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> or more
            were represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Output from
            Network2.oc was critically evaluated and some
            modifications made to best fit a model of minimum
            mutation.
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>-gamete test
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All</NUMEX> pairs of biallelic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> were cross-tabulated to
            identify the number of unique <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-locus haplotypes
            present. An observation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different haplotypes
            from a pair of biallelic loci was considered evidence
            for recombination or recurrent mutation.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Population differentiation</ENAMEX> and pairwise F
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>
            Pairwise 
            F 
            
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> 
             was calculated as the genetic variance among
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> divided by the genetic variance of the
            total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> using haplotypic data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . An
            exact test of population differentiation was applied to
            the haplotypic data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The computer software
            Arlequin was used to perform these calculations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX>
            ] .
          
          
            Linkage disequilibrium calculations
            Pairwise linkage disequilibria were calculated using
            the 
            r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2statistic</TIMEX>. Terms for allele
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-locus haplotype frequencies are given in Table
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. 
            r 2was calculated using
            
            where 
            D = ƒ 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ƒ 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> - ƒ 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ƒ 
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> . Normalized linkage
            disequilibrium parameters 
            D ' were calculated using the
            method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewontin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hartl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
            Statistical significance of the standardized linkage
            disequilibrium parameter was calculated using the
            formula
            
            with one degree of freedom [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , where 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the number of
            chromosomes.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> efficiency analysis (AEA)
          To assess the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> marker to detect a given
          disease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second marker</TIMEX>, we derived a
          measure we call association efficiency, which is the
          relative risk at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> by virtue of its association
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> SNP. Consider a disease-modifying SNP 
          A that is in linkage disequilibrium
          with a neighboring nonfunctional SNP 
          B . We define 
          R

          A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and the frequency of each haplotype,
          we can derive the frequency of allele

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> among diseased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (

          The frequency of allele

          as 
          q 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Thus, in a case-control study
          where diseased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          drawn from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, we would obtain an
          odds ratio for allele 
          B 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of
          
          This odds ratio provides an approximation of the

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> by virtue of its association with

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> .
          When locus B is considered to be the disease-modifying

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> compared to

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , it can be shown that the relative

          B ) we calculate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> values for
          each pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Entropy maximization method (EMM)
          A measure of haplotypic diversity, entropy ( 
          E ), was calculated using
          
          where 
          p 
          
            i 
           is the frequency of the 
          i th haplotype, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is the number of unique
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> in the sample. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entropy</ENAMEX> is maximized when all
          haplotypes have the same frequency. We developed an
          algorithim that chooses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, first individually, then in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multi-SNP</ENAMEX> haplotypes, that maximize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entropy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Thus
          we can define a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that represent the
          greatest proportion of the full <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-SNP haplotypic
          diversity. This method provides for the selection of
          optimal haplotype-tagging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> even in the absence of a
          clear haplotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block structure</ENAMEX>.
