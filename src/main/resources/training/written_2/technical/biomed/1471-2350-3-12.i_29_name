        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rett syndrome</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">OMIM # 312750</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/Omim/</ENAMEX>) is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> dominant
        disorder that occurs with a prevalance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> births [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and almost exclusively in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        Named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas Rett</ENAMEX> who <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recognized the disorder
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> is characterized by a
        constellation of clinical findings that have resulted in
        the establishment of clinical criteria for the diagnosis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . Common clinical features include early normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 6-18 months of age</TIMEX> followed
        by a period of developmental stagnation and subsequent
        regression, usually by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX> of life. Characteristic
        findings include loss of speech and motor skills,
        deceleration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> growth, stereotypic hand movements,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seizures</ENAMEX>, respiratory abnormalities, scoliosis and growth
        delay. Although the disorder is usually sporadic, due to
        new mutations, a few familial cases permitted exclusion
        mapping on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome with assignment of the
        responsible gene to band Xq28 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MECP2</TIMEX>, the gene that encodes the DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding protein MeCP2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-CpG binding protein 2</ENAMEX>), have
        been found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 65-77%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rett</ENAMEX> syndrome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . The functional consequence of MECP2
        mutations resulting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rett</ENAMEX> syndrome is loss of function.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four MECP2</TIMEX> exons encode a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">486</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is believed to be a transcriptional repressor
        based on in vitro studies. MeCP2's functional structure
        consists of an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid methyl</ENAMEX>-binding domain (MBD) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> transcriptional repression domain
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRD</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBD</ENAMEX> is able to bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> cytosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX> of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">CpG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dinucleotide</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Under the
        current model, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MeCP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with
        Sin3A through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> histone deacetylases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAC</ENAMEX>). Deacetylation of core histones then alters
        chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and results in transcriptional
        repression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MeCP2</TIMEX> is a ubiquitously expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, its
        expression is highest in the brain, lung and spleen and
        less abundant in the kidney and heart [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . It's
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> is also specific, with expression in
        neurons but not in glia. Expression levels in brain
        increase postnatally [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . These findings explain why
        the most prominent clinical features of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rett syndrome</ENAMEX> are
        related to central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. The
        presence of growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , osteopenia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ,
        and gastrointestinal abnormalities, however, suggest a
        potentially important role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MeCP2</TIMEX>'s function in the
        peripheral and autonomous nervous system and in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MeCP2</TIMEX>'s expression is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ubiquitous</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-CpG binding proteins</ENAMEX> that exist
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBD1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBD2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kaiso</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ,
        may reduce the effect of mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MECP2</TIMEX> in peripheral
        organ systems while the lack of such redundancy may lead to
        a more pronounced phenotype in the brain. This theory
        remains speculative, however, since the tissue specificity
        and definitive identification of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">redundancy</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methyl-CpG</ENAMEX> binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have not been established.
        Regardless, the targets of MeCP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modulation</ENAMEX> remain unknown
        in the brain or elsewhere.
        To identify potential downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of MeCP2
        modulation, we have compared global gene expression
        patterns in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four</TIMEX> matched pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clonally</ENAMEX> derived mutant
        or wild-type MECP2-expressing fibroblast cell strains from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rett syndrome</ENAMEX>, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> wild-type and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant MeCP2</ENAMEX>-expressing lymphoblastoid cell lines, by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizing Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U95</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A-E</ENAMEX>) oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>. The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clonally</ENAMEX> derived fibroblasts
        eliminated the mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation seen in tissues from
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rett</ENAMEX> syndrome. Furthermore, expression
        patterns in clones with the mutant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MECP2</NUMEX> allele active were
        compared with those in clones with the wild-type allele on
        the active <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome. Because both types of clones are
        derived from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> introduced by
        differences in autosomal genetic background is eliminated
        by our experimental strategy. The use of lymphoblastoid
        cell lines, while not all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clonally</ENAMEX> derived, expanded the
        scope of genes to be assayed beyond those expressed in skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. Our interrogations identified a statistically
        significant number of genes with differential expression
        patterns between wild-type and mutant cell strains,
        however, the results across multiple clones from the same
        individual showed substantial variability, questioning the
        significance of some of the genes identified. The
        lymphoblasts, while not analysed in a matched comparison,
        yielded a relatively short list of genes with differential
        expression that includes some potentially interesting
        candidate genes.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell culture, single cell cloning and nucleic acid
          extraction for fibroblasts
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> fibroblast strains from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with clinically
          diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rett syndrome</ENAMEX> were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coriell Cell</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Repositories</ENAMEX>. MECP2 mutations were identified in our
          laboratory as previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GM07982</TIMEX>:
          705delG; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GM11270</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">916C>T</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R306C</NUMEX>); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GM11272</TIMEX>: 1155del32
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GM11273</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">316C>T</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R106W</NUMEX>)]. From each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, single-cell derived clonal cell strains were
          established. To do so, fibroblasts were trypsinized
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GibcoBRL Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) and diluted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cells/ml.</ENAMEX> By using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125 Î¼m</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Stripperâ„¢ Tip</ENAMEX> (MidAtlantic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostics, Marlton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) under direct microscopic
          visualization, individual cells were transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
          well plates. Cells were grown with filtered (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 Î¼m</NUMEX>)
          conditioned medium that was prepared by culturing the
          primary cell strain for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> during the exponential
          growth phase in MEM-alpha (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>
          fetal calf serum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gemini</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodland</ENAMEX>, CA), penicillin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">U/ml</ENAMEX>), streptomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), and glutamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">290</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GibcoBRL Life Technologies</ENAMEX>). Upon confluency of
          the well, the cells were trypsinized and expanded. Growth
          rates and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> were closely monitored.
          Only clonal cell strains in the exponential growth phase
          with similar cell and clonal morphology were selected for
          further study. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA STAT</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tel-Test Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Friendswood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight 150</NUMEX> mm plates
          of exponentially growing sub-confluent cells that were at
          similar passage numbers. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from two
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> mm plates using a standard extraction
          protocol to determine <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome inactivation status
          and verify monoclonality.
        
        
          Cell culture, single cell cloning and nucleic acid
          extraction for lymphoblasts
          Clonal cell lines with the mutant <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MECP2</NUMEX> allele on the
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome were derived from lymphoblastoid cell
          lines (LCLs) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with clinically diagnosed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rett syndrome</ENAMEX> and known mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T158M, 803delG, R168X</ENAMEX>)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1159del28</TIMEX> (unpublished) using the technique
          described above. Individual cells were cultured in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">conditioned RPMI 1640</ENAMEX> medium with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penicillin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 U/ml</ENAMEX>), streptomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 U/ml</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutamine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">290 ng/ml</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> cell lines from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with
          known MECP2 mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R106W</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R255X</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> with
          803delG) but completely skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome inactivation
          with the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MECP2</ENAMEX> allele on the active X
          chromosome were also cultured. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clonal
          cell line with the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MECP2</ENAMEX> allele on the active X
          chromosome was established using the cloning technique
          described above. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA STAT</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tel-Test Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Friendswood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using
          a standard extraction protocol to determine <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
          inactivation status and verify monoclonality.
        
        
          X chromosome inactivation studies
          Clonality was further confirmed and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
          inactivation status was determined by the length of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphic CAG</ENAMEX> trinucleotide repeat on the inactive
          androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor allele</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Restriction
          digestion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> restriction sites between the flanking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> and adjacent to the trinucleotide repeat were
          carried out with the methylation sensitive enzymes HpaII
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HhaI</ENAMEX>. Amplification of the undigested allele that
          included the trinucleotide repeat region was performed
          using the fluorescent-labeled primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-6FAM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CTGTGAAGGTTGCTGTTCCTCAT-3</ENAMEX>' and the unlabeled primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TCCAGAATCTGTTCCAGAGCGTGC-3</ENAMEX>'. The lengths of the
          amplification products were identified using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> 377
          sequencer with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneScanâ„</ENAMEX>¢ fragment analysis software
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA). Undigested DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from each of the original cell cultures were
          amplified to determine the lengths of each allele.
        
        
          Allele-specific MECP2 transcript analysis
          Reverse transcription of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexamers</ENAMEX>. Absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> contamination was verified by
          amplification of the intron containing region of the
          MECP2 gene between exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 3</ENAMEX> based

          conditions previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and later modified
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> exonuclease

          The enzymes were heat inactivated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>.
          Both strands of the treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product were sequenced
          with fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">labelled terminator nucleotides</ENAMEX> on the

          MeCP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression in fibroblast clones and
          lymphoblastoid cell lines was determined by immunoblot

          Quality control parameters were assessed throughout
          the experimental process to assure the quality of the

          of hybridization, and consistency of qualitative calls.
          Assessment during the synthesis of the hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX> was accomplished by spectrophotometric
          analysis of the starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and cRNA and gel

          Microarray data analysis for fibroblast
          clones
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®were analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MicroArray Suite</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0â„¢</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 3.0</NUMEX>) with target intensities normalized to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX>. Baseline genetic expression profiles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clonal
          wild-type MeCP2-expressing fibroblast strain were
          compared to the expression profile of the matched clonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant MeCP2</ENAMEX>-expressing cell strain, for each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          different MECP2 mutations. Analyzed data were imported to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MicroDBâ„¢</ENAMEX> and queried using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix's Data Mining Tool</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMT</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> matched pair comparisons were queried for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directional</ENAMEX> changes. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>/ESTs with increased levels
          of expression, defined by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 3.0</NUMEX> as marginally increased
          or increased, wild-type baseline expression levels could
          be present or absent. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with decreased levels of
          expression, defined by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAS 3.0</NUMEX> as marginally decreased or
          decreased, wild-type baseline expression levels were
          required to be present. We identified genes that
          demonstrated the same directional change in at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> comparisons. We computed p values for genes
          identified by this criterion. We assumed that if a gene
          was not subject to a systematic change in expression
          level, an observed directional change in a given mutant
          strain would occur randomly and independently with
          probability equal to the overall proportion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directional</ENAMEX> changes observed in that mutant strain. We
          used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-sample, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided t-tests on the reported
          GeneChip Â®fold changes to assess whether the log fold
          changes of mutant cell strains differ from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> on
          average. We report the corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> (CI) after conversion back from the log scale.
          Although the assumptions of the t-test cannot be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verified</ENAMEX>, there was insufficient data to carry out
          alternative tests.

          profile was compared to each wild-type control profile
          yielding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> comparisons. Analyzed data was imported to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MicroDBâ„¢</ENAMEX> and queried using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMT</ENAMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> comparisons were
          queried to identify genes that demonstrated similar

        Results
        
          Characterization of clonal cell strains
          Clonal mutant and wild-type MECP2 expressing
          fibroblast cell strains were successfully established
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with different mutations, one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">missense</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBD</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> missense in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRD</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons.
          Clonality was established by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent methods:
          visualization of each cell transferred for clonal
          culture, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation pattern analysis of the
          polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen</ENAMEX> receptor alleles using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneScanâ„¢</ENAMEX>,
          and identification of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">single-allele</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MECP2</ENAMEX> transcripts
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The levels of MECP2 transcripts were virtually
          identical by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis (less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> cycle thresholds difference) across all eight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, one wild-type and one mutant from each
          individual, that were used for oligonucleotide array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This result is not
          surprising. Given the fact that the premature termination
          codons resulting from the frameshift mutations are all
          located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' final exon of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MECP2</NUMEX> gene,
          preferential degradation of nonsense codon-containing
          transcripts would not be expected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          To assess MeCP2 expression at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level,
          immunoblot analysis with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against the
          C-terminal region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MeCP2</ENAMEX> was carried out on total cell
          lysates from all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibroblast</ENAMEX> clones, and from some

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A reacting protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (at the molecular weight of

          genes were increased in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> comparisons. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>

          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VSHK1 and CA12</TIMEX>), represented twice on the chips with

          Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblast</ENAMEX> clones
          To assess the reliability of the array hybridization

          genes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> with increased and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> with decreased expression)
          were quantified using real-time quantitative RT-PCR
          analysis with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sybr Green Â®.</ENAMEX> The same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> used for
          making array hybridization probes were used as templates
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation coefficient was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> values from triplicate assays. The fold
          change data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips</ENAMEX> Â®and RT-PCR analyses
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) were converted to log scale for analysis and
          comparison. The correlation of the combined RT-PCR fold
          change data (based on average of log of the three
          measurements from each wild-type and each mutant sample)
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> Â®log fold change data was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.92</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> =

          To assess the consistency of differential gene
          expression among a larger number of independently derived
          cell clones from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, we selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          genes with large fold change values that had been
          identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with increased expression in mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MTAP44</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP3 and NTN4</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> with decreased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRIP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMP</ENAMEX>) were quantitatively tested in
          multiple clonal cell strains from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (with
          MECP2 mutations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1155del32 and R106W</TIMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
          Expression levels varied significantly from clone to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> and between cell strains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Fold change
          values for the multiple clone comparisons were mostly
          inconsistent with the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneChip/RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data.
          Furthermore, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval for fold change
          included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> (no change) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> comparisons
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CRIP1</ENAMEX> was significantly different
          between wild-type and mutant clones for both Rett
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.035</NUMEX>), however,
          the direction of change was different. Increased
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MTAP44</TIMEX>, encoding the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX>-inducible microtubular aggregate protein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>,
          remained significant in comparison of the mutant and
          wild-type clones for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.027</NUMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Oligonucleotide array hybridization data of
          lymphoblasts
          The global gene expression pattern in fibroblasts is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>, and single cell cloning may amplify stochastic
          events in culture that may be responsible for the wide
          range of transcript levels in fibroblast clones. We,
          therefore, extended the microarray analyses to
          lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> clonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant MeCP2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T158M</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">803delG</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R168X and 1159del28</TIMEX>)
          expressing and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clonal (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1159del28</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skewed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">R106W, R255X, 803delG, 803delG</ENAMEX>) wild-type MeCP2
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCLs</ENAMEX>. The percent "present" calls ranged from
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> (chip <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (chip A) and, as for the fibroblast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, standard deviations for the percent "present" calls
          for a given chip were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>, and differences in percent
          "present" calls between wild type samples compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant samples</ENAMEX> were not significant. When the expression
          profile of each mutant was compared to that of each
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LCL</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were found to be differentially
          expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 15</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> comparisons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showed increased levels of expression, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          showed decreased expression. Of those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> are
          annotated as known genes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> are expressed in brain.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> was performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          with increased and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with decreased expression) to
          assess the accuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> results. In a plot
          similar to that shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the correlation of the
          combined RT-PCR fold change data with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> Â®log
          fold change data was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.91</NUMEX> (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random X</ENAMEX> inactivation patterns are characteristic for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rett</ENAMEX> syndrome that is caused by heterozygosity for
        mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> locus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MECP2</TIMEX>. Our study design was
        intended to take advantage of the mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
        inactivation in cell strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rett</ENAMEX> syndrome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. From
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> original fibroblast samples, we generated clonally
        derived cell strains that expressed only the mutant MeCP2
        or only the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MECP2 allele</ENAMEX>, but not both. We
        hypothesized that the effects of MeCP2 dysfunction in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> clonal cell strain would be more pronounced than in
        the original cell strain with mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>. Moreover, we were able to establish the ideal
        matched control for each clonal mutant cell strain, a
        clonal cell strain with the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MECP2</ENAMEX> allele on the
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. Comparative
        transcription profiling of matched pairs of fibroblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> should eliminate any noise contributed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> or mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autosomal genes</ENAMEX>.
        Although MeCP2 expression is higher in other tissues
        such as brain, spleen and lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , the value gained by
        the matched pair comparisons of clonal skin fibroblast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains cultured</ENAMEX> under identical environmental conditions,
        should overcome the drawbacks of evaluating a tissue with a
        lower level of expression. Previously reported microarray
        studies of female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rett</ENAMEX> and unrelated control brain samples
        revealed expression changes that were interpreted as
        secondary to the disease process, such as increased
        expression of glial-specific genes and decreased expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neuronal genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, when searching for
        the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MeCP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">modulation</ENAMEX>, it might be
        advantageous to study a tissue that is less obviously
        involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathologic</ENAMEX> processes of the disease.
        To identify potential target genes of MeCP2 regulation,
        we looked for genes with increased transcript levels in at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mutant/wild-type MECP2 expressing
        fibroblast comparisons. Similarly, genes with decreased
        expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> matched pair
        comparisons were also considered potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of MeCP2
        regulation. If the calls made did not reflect real
        increases or decreases, we would expect expression level
        increases and decreases to be scattered randomly throughout
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63,175</NUMEX> transcripts interrogated. By random chance
        alone, we would expect to see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than four</NUMEX> genes
        increased in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> comparisons and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than one</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) increased in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> comparisons. The
        number of differentially regulated genes identified by
        these criteria, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> with increased and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> with decreased
        expression, is significantly higher than expected by random
        chance, but it is much lower than one would expect if MeCP2
        had a crucial role as transcriptional repressor of all
        genes with methylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
        To validate the microarray expression data with an
        independent method, we carried out real-time quantitative
        RT-PCR analyses for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-</ENAMEX>set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> samples
        that were used on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips Â®.</ENAMEX> The results were
        amazingly consistent for fold change and direction of
        change in almost all instances. We, therefore, chose to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative RT-PCR</ENAMEX> alone to assess whether the increased
        or decreased expression patterns observed in the initial
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> matched pairs of clones were consistent in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> and, therefore, might be biologically meaningful.
        Much to our surprise, expression levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>
        additional MeCP2-deficient and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> additional MeCP2-positive
        clones from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, one with a missense and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a truncating mutation, showed tremendous
        variation. In the multiple clone comparisons, the fold
        change values trended away from the significant fold
        changes seen on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChips Â®and RT-PCR</ENAMEX> of the original
        matched pair comparisons toward <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> (no change). CRIP1
        expression generated significant p values, but the
        direction of change differed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> tested.
        In the truncating mutation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1155del32</TIMEX>, expression was
        decreased and in the missense mutation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R106W</TIMEX>, it was
        increased. Although individual background genetic
        differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> might be
        responsible for these results, the possibility that the
        opposite type changes are mutation-type specific needs to
        be evaluated by studies of clones from additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only MTAP44</TIMEX>, encoding the interferon-inducible
        microtubular aggregate protein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>, remained significant in
        comparison of the mutant and wild-type clones, with average
        increases of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.12</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.58</NUMEX> fold, for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        tested. The product of this gene was first identified by a
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against microtubular aggregates in
        hepatocytes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis C</ENAMEX> virus
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . The production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p44</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is markedly induced in
        the liver of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis D</ENAMEX> virus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Inducibility by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX>-alpha/beta, but not by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon-gamma</ENAMEX>, is
        mediated by an interferon-stimulated response element in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The gene was independently
        identified in a search for novel interferon-inducible genes
        in the mouse (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dron, M., Meritet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.F.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tovey</ENAMEX>, M.G.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unpublished</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank # AJ299405</ENAMEX>). Also known as IFI44 (for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interferon</ENAMEX>-inducible protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>), the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> is located
        on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1p31.1</NUMEX>. Although predominantly expressed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uterus</ENAMEX> and other internal organs, transcripts have been
        isolated from brain and hypothalamus cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dbEST</ENAMEX>). The putative function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the brain
        is still a mystery.
        A different design was used for the microarray study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rett syndrome</ENAMEX> LCLs. We initiated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCL</ENAMEX> study because
        MeCP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression was higher in lymphoblasts than in
        fibroblasts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCLs</ENAMEX> have an overlapping expression
        pattern that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> not expressed in fibroblasts.
        Because of skewed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> inactivation in the available <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCLs</ENAMEX>,
        however, we were only able to obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> matched pair of
        mutant versus wild-type expressing clones (for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1159del28</TIMEX>).
        For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> different comparisons, we included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant-</ENAMEX>allele expressing clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T158M, 803delG, R168X</ENAMEX>) and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> completely skewed wild-type MeCP2 expressing LCLs
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">R106W, R255X, 803delG, 803delG</ENAMEX>) from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>.
        Nevertheless, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes were
        identified, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-</ENAMEX>set confirmed by quantitative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. None of these genes were identical to any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> found in the fibroblast study. Gene expression
        patterns in primary fibroblasts and transformed
        lymphoblasts are different and/or may respond differently
        to MeCP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>. Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> targets
        identified in lymphoblasts that are also expressed in brain
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>) may warrant further evaluation.
        While our initial matched fibroblast clonal comparisons
        identified numerous genes with consistent results that
        could be targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MeCP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">modulation</ENAMEX>, verification of a
        small subset of these data by comparing additional clones
        not used on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GeneChip Â®analysis</ENAMEX> revealed amazing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inconsistency</ENAMEX>. The variability of gene expression across
        clonal cell strains with the same genotype and the same X
        chromosome active was similar among clones expressing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> or the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MECP2 allele</ENAMEX>. Therefore, it is not
        likely to result from MeCP2 dysfunction and we can exclude
        the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MECP2</ENAMEX> mutations lead to transcript
        instability. More likely, fibroblasts in culture undergo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> modification of gene expression, by somatic
        mutations or epigenetic regulation, and such rare events
        may be amplified in single-cell derived clones. In uncloned
        fibroblast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> from replicate cultures
        revealed consistent results in comparative large-scale gene
        expression studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Cell lines, i.e. transformed,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immortalized</ENAMEX> or tumor-derived cell lines, are well known to
        be heteroploid i.e. chromosomally unstable, and any
        single-cell derived clones of such lines are genetically
        heterogeneous. Therefore, some differences in transcript
        levels among such clones would not be surprising. There are
        almost no reports in the literature, however, on
        comparative gene expression studies in clones of primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the reasons may be that it is difficult
        to generate such clones. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Griffin et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        reported variation in the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> 5alpha
        reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to
        dihydrotestosterone, in cloned human skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>.
        Activity of this enzyme is low in non-genital skin but high
        in genital skin cells that grow in response to androgen.
        Foreskin-derived fibroblast clones varied greatly (up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> fold) in enzyme activity. The range of activity for
        other microsomal enzymes was much lower in the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblast</ENAMEX> clones. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> did not study mRNA levels
        but reductase activity, therefore, variation at the level
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> stability could also play a role.
        Our data could be interpreted to suggest that microarray
        experiments should be performed on greater numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and/or samples from mutant and wild-type brain to
        generate meaningful data. It is instructive, however, that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tudor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> compared global gene expression in a
        large number of wild-type and 
        Mecp2 -null male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and failed to
        identify striking changes in gene expression in the brain [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Both fibroblast and lymphoblast data together agree in
        the most important positive result of our studies: MeCP2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deficiency</ENAMEX> does not result in global deregulation of gene
        expression. This result is novel and unexpected in light of
        the purported function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MeCP2</TIMEX> as a global transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulator</ENAMEX> that was based on in vitro biochemical studies.
        There are several possibilities that might explain our
        findings. First, redundancy in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX>-CpG binding proteins
        that recruit transcriptional silencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> may mask
        the effects of MeCP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>; for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MBD1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MBD2</TIMEX> or
        Kaiso, may complement the defect in the cell types we
        studied. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, if the inter-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">clonal</NUMEX> variation we detected
        by the quantitative RT-PCR study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> clones
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rett</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were representative of
        a general feature of diploid fibroblast clones, it could
        have masked any consistent biologically meaningful
        expression changes. If our limited findings were confirmed
        by larger-scale studies, we would need to conclude that
        clonal fibroblast <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are not a suitable resource for
        genome-wide expression profiling studies. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
        deregulation of very few genes expressed only in parts of
        the brain, or only under certain conditions, may be
        responsible for the neuronal abnormalities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rett</ENAMEX> brains,
        and this would not be detected by microarray studies.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MeCP2</TIMEX> action on chromatin, as suggested by observed
        changes in histone acetylation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] , may not involve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coding genes</ENAMEX> that are represented on microarrays,
        but instead, may affect centromeric heterochromatin or the
        expression of small non-coding RNAs that are abundant in
        normal brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The results presented in this paper
        contradict the established model of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MeCP2</NUMEX> function and
        necessitate a rethinking of strategies to unravel the
        pathologic process that leads to neuronal dysfunction in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rett syndrome</ENAMEX>.
