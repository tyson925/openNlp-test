        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer</ENAMEX> is a progressive genetic disease that involves
        the accumulation of multiple and heterogeneous genetic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epigenetic</ENAMEX> changes. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> human genes [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , an expanding list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has been shown to be
        involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> development and progression. Recently
        developed technologies, including cDNA microarrays, allow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to screen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes
        simultaneously to identify genes that show abnormal
        expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> face a serious challenge when trying
        to apply these tools to clinical cancer specimens. First,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> are often detected at a late stage in development,
        after multiple genetic and epigenetic changes have rendered
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> metastatic and highly refractory even to harsh
        treatment. Multiple clones in the same tumor mass, which
        can often be distinguished by morphological features, would
        yield more information if they could be microdissected and
        analyzed separately. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, tumor tissues invariably
        include a mixture of different cells, such as inflammatory
        cells, stromal cells, vascular cells, and others. Each type
        of cells may contribute to a unique aspect of the cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> and may serve as a target for treatment.
        Therefore, there is a need to dissect those cells for
        separate study. For example, it was found that tumor
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have distinct gene expression profiles from
        those of normal vascular cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , and the genes that
        are uniquely expressed on the surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> endothelium
        cells can serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for specific cancer therapy.
        Finally, a key breakthrough in cancer treatment would come
        from early detection and diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and the study
        of molecular events in the early stages of cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. A difficulty in studying <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
        stages is that the tumor size is small and only limited
        material can be obtained through means such as fine needle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aspiration</ENAMEX>. Identification of the genetic changes in such a
        small sample is especially challenging because only limited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> can be performed using conventional approaches. It
        is obvious that the full potential of genomic technologies
        will only be realized if they can be applied to minute
        amounts of biological material.
        For a typical gene expression profiling experiment
        carried out on a glass microarray where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of cDNA
        probes are deposited in an orderly manner, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is first
        isolated from the biological material under study. The mRNA
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>) is reverse transcribed to cDNA, during
        which process fluorescent dyes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy3</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cy5</NUMEX>) are
        incorporated. The labeled cDNAs are hybridized to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> and, after washing, the fluorescent signals are
        detected by a laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">scanner</ENAMEX>. Current protocols typically
        require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 50 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for consistent
        microarray hybridization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several hundred</NUMEX> milligrams of
        tumor tissues are often needed to obtain this much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>,
        which is simply unavailable in many situations. Thus, it is
        crucial to develop a more sensitive and reliable procedure
        that requires less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Several molecular biology
        approaches, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7</ENAMEX> in vitro transcription and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> based
        assays, have been attempted [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . However, only
        cursory analysis has been carried out to validate the
        assays, and limited confirmation experiments have been
        performed to evaluate the validity of the amplification
        results.
        In this study, we performed and analyzed a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments to evaluate an amplification
        protocol adopted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Focusing primarily on
        the ability to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, we
        developed the following criteria for a successful
        amplification protocol:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Because amplification may enhance the signal of genes
        expressed at low copy numbers, more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> should be
        detected by an amplification protocol than by a regular
        protocol.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Most genes detected as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed using
        a regular protocol should also be detected using an
        amplification protocol. In other words, the two protocols
        should reveal similar patterns of differential
        expression.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. An amplification protocol should generate signal
        intensity profiles as reproducibly and reliably as a
        regular protocol.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Microarray results obtained from an amplification
        protocol should match data obtained from other molecular
        biology approaches such as northern blotting, western
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blotting</ENAMEX> and immunohistochemistry assay.
        Our results showed that our amplification protocol
        produced reproducible, reliable microarray data that was
        consistent with the regular protocol. We also confirmed
        that our amplification protocol revealed accurate
        information about the differential expression of low copy
        number genes that failed to give sufficient signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> using the regular protocol. Therefore, many
        clinical experiments for which only a minute amount of
        material is available can be pursued using this
        protocol.
      
      
        Results
        
          Enhancement of signal intensity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed
          at a low copy number
          We expected the amplification protocol to increase the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity of low expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; in other words,
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having measurable signal intensity
          above background levels from using the amplification
          protocol should be higher than that using the regular
          protocol. We used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> to determine if a gene has
          measurable signal intensity on an array; i.e., if the
          difference between signal intensity and background
          intensity is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of the local background,
          then the gene gives adequate signal intensity. We
          assessed all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> arrays; the results are summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The results showed that the number of genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">whose S/N</ENAMEX> ratio exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> of background is
          consistently higher in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> when using the
          amplification protocol. The signal intensities of low
          expressors, indeed, are improved so that more genes
          turned out to be detectable. Our result also showed that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> step (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>) before aRNA amplification
          had no detectable effect on the final results.
        
        
          Consistent patterns of differential gene
          expression
          Finding differentially expressed genes is one of the
          goals of microarray technology. Ideally, both the regular
          and amplification protocols would identify the same list
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. We did not expect to
          see identical lists of differentially expressed genes
          generated from the two protocols, since we may not even
          achieve that goal using the same protocol twice due to
          the variability associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . However, we do want to see most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes appearing on both
          lists.
          To identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computed</ENAMEX> "smooth t-statistics". To apply this method, we
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> computed the mean log intensity and the standard
          deviation for the replicated spots within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.
          Since the standard deviation varies systematically with
          the mean, we then fit a smooth curve representing the
          standard deviation as a function of the mean. After
          pooling the smooth estimates of standard deviation from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels, we used the pooled estimates to compute
          a t-statistic for each gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 15</NUMEX> ] . These "smooth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-statistics" can also be viewed as "studentized log
          ratios"; i.e., as log ratios between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that have
          been rescaled to account for the intrinsic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>.
          We found that the consistency and reproducibility of
          smooth t-statistics between experiments is high
          regardless of the protocol being used. We quantified the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> using the concordance coefficient, which
          is analogous to the correlation coefficient but measures
          how well a set of points matches the identity line [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . The concordance between experiments using the
          regular protocol ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.574 to 0.835</NUMEX>, with a
          median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.739</NUMEX>. The concordance using the amplification
          protocol ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.843 to 0.894</NUMEX>, with a median of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.873</NUMEX>. The concordance between the experiments using
          different protocols ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.562 to 0.796</NUMEX>, with a
          median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.652</NUMEX>.
          Using data from all experiments performed with the
          regular protocol, we computed a combined set of smooth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-statistics. We computed a similar set of t-statistics
          using data from all experiments performed with the
          amplification protocol. Genes are viewed as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed if the smooth t-statistic
          exceeds some threshold; for this study, we chose genes
          with smooth t-statistic greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> in absolute
          value. Using this criterion, we found that the regular
          protocol identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were differentially
          expressed between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U251 and LN229</TIMEX> cell lines, and the
          amplification protocol identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> differentially
          expressed genes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were common to both lists.
          Thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were found using the amplification
          protocol but not the regular protocol; the smooth
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-statistics for these genes ranged in absolute value
          from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.19 to 3.96</NUMEX>, with a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.23</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          found using the regular protocol but not the
          amplification protocol; the smooth t-statistics for these
          genes using the amplification protocol ranged in absolute
          value from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.16</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.97</NUMEX> with a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.42</NUMEX>. In every
          case, the sign of the t-scores was the same using the
          different protocols, indicating that the same cell line
          overexpressed the gene.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproducibility</ENAMEX> and reliability of signal
          intensity
          To evaluate whether the amplification protocol
          preserved signals that were seen using the regular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, we first found all the spots in each channel
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U251</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LN229</NUMEX>) that consistently had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> in all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> experiments using the regular protocol. We then
          computed the percentage of those genes that also had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX>
          > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> on each of the arrays using the amplification
          protocol. We found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95% to 100%</NUMEX> of the genes that are
          consistently found to be expressed using the regular
          protocol were also found to be expressed using the
          amplification protocol. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U251</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> amplified
          arrays, the percentages are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>; for
          LN229, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Confirmation of the results from amplification
          experiments
          A key criterion for the validity of microarray
          experiments is whether the results are real and can be
          confirmed by other approaches. In order to obtain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative information</ENAMEX> rather than noise from
          nonspecific binding of targets to the DNA probes in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microarray</ENAMEX> experiment, the hybridization has to be
          specific. To demonstrate the hybridization specificity in
          our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, we selectively labeled a
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> such as actin or GAPDH with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dye and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to the microarray. Our results showed that the
          specific target only hybridized to its corresponding
          spots on the array [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, in order to confirm
          the results, the clones printed on the microarray have to
          be correct and error free. This is an important issue
          because most clone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> used for making microarrays
          contain significant errors. To surmount this problem, all
          the clones printed on our microarrays were sequence
          verified before printing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Because of those
          quality control measures, we expected that our microarray
          results should be confirmed as long as the amplification
          is stable and consistent among different experiments.
          From the results of comparison between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U251 and LN229</TIMEX>,
          we selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that showed differential expression
          either using both the regular and the amplification
          procedures or only using the amplification procedure.
          Among these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were detected by both protocols
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were only detected by the amplification
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Genes that belong to the latter case
          are most likely expressed at very low levels that fall
          below the threshold of detection by the regular protocol.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were then tested by other molecular
          methodologies.
          We first selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S100</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>, that are
          common markers for glial cells. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U251</ENAMEX> and LN229
          cells, the microarray results from both protocols showed
          that S100 was expressed at higher levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LN229</NUMEX> cells
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> at higher levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U251</NUMEX> cells. U251 and LN229
          cells were embedded in paraffin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> and sectioned. The
          sections were stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> for those two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX>. The immunohistochemistry results showed that
          S100 is expressed at higher levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LN229</NUMEX> cells and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX> at higher levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U251</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>). Two
          additional genes, HLA-DR alpha and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNRP-B</ENAMEX>, that were also
          obtained using the two protocols, were confirmed by
          northern blotting (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>).
          We mentioned that some low-expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could only
          be detected by the amplification protocol and not by the
          regular protocol. To confirm whether the new information
          by this approach is reliable, we randomly picked up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGFBP2</ENAMEX> and integrin beta
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, that were identified by the amplification protocol but
          not by the regular protocol for confirmation using
          western blotting, northern blotting and
          immunohistochemistry assays. The results from these
          experiments showed that all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were expressed
          at higher levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U251</NUMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) as obtained by
          the microarray data. It should be noted that for the low
          expressed genes that could only be detected by the
          amplification protocol, longer exposure time for the
          northern blotting is needed and the signal intensity is
          much lower than that generated from the high expressed
          genes that could be detected by both protocols (Figure
          2B).
          In summary, we have carried out a series of
          confirmation experiments using northern blotting, western
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blotting</ENAMEX> and immunohistochemistry assay and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes revealed from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments have been confirmed.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A major difficulty in the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is that cancer
        cells are extremely elusive and the genetic mutation events
        are continuously occurring temporally and spatially. The
        development of high throughput genomic technologies enables
        us to screen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes simultaneously for the
        informative genes, yet the power of these technologies is
        greatly attenuated when inappropriate samples are studied.
        Generally speaking, the most biologically appropriate
        materials obtained from clinical samples are small in
        quantity. This observation motivates the development of
        experimental protocols that allow application of genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> to minute amounts of biological materials. In
        this manuscript, we have described such a method that
        allows us to use cDNA microarrays with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 1 microgram</NUMEX> of
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
        The initial evaluation of the methodology is based on
        the detection of fluorescent signals on the microarray
        after hybridization. Although we could see bright spots
        with the amplification protocols, this apparent "success"
        does not mean the information so acquired is reliable.
        False positives are often the result of side-effects during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. We set out to assess the accuracy and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> using both statistical and experimental
        approaches. Both approaches supported the validity of our
        protocol in the identification of differentially expressed
        genes in two cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. This demonstrates that the
        same genes are amplified to the same extent in different
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. However, in our results, the amount of
        amplification varies from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> to gene. Therefore, the
        amplification process is not balanced and changes the
        relative transcript levels in a given cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, from the amplified results, one cannot infer the
        relative expression levels of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a single
        sample. However, in most biological studies, identification
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes among different samples
        is the main aim. These genes can serve as useful markers
        for diagnosis, for prediction of therapeutic response, and
        perhaps as a target for developing new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Thus, we have
        developed an assay that will enable us to approach a series
        of important clinical issues given a limited amount of
        material. This assay has been used in several ongoing
        studies and useful information has been obtained.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have confirmed a powerful and consistent cDNA
        microarray procedure that can be used to study minute
        amounts of biological tissue.

          Microarray production
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,304</NUMEX> known human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> were prepared by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX> cDNA clone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> using
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primers on the vector. The sequences of the two
          primers are: up-stream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CTGCAAGGCATTAAGTTGGGTAAC-3</ENAMEX>';

          Microarray hybridization and scanning
          To hybridize the arrays, purified and labeled cDNA
          targets were dissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼l total volume of
          ExpressHyb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) containing

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-60</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼g</NUMEX> of

          (Gibco-BRL). The mixture was heated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">95Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>,
          then applied to the slides and covered by a coverslip.
          Hybridization was carried out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14-16 hours</TIMEX> in
          a moisturized box in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX>. Slides were washed at

          were scanned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-Î¼m resolution on a LSIV scanner
          (Genomic Solution, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann Arbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> quantification
          Scanned microarray images (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16-bit</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIFF</ENAMEX> formatted
          files) were quantified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayVisionâ„¢</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imaging</ENAMEX>
          Research, Inc., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>), and
          values were recorded for spot intensity, local background
          intensity, and signal-to-noise (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX>) ratio. Spot
          intensity was computed as the integrated optical density
          or volume in a fixed-size circle; background intensity
          was computed as the median pixel value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          diamond-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> at the corners of each spot.
          Background-corrected intensity was computed by
          subtracting local background from spot intensity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX>
          ratio was computed by dividing the background-corrected
          intensity by the standard deviation (SD) of the
          background pixels.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> normalization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from all microarrays was imported into S-plusâ„¢
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insightful Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WA</ENAMEX>), for further analysis.
          For each microarray, the background-corrected spot
          intensities were normalized by setting the 75th
          percentile equal to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>. This procedure brings the
          median log ratio between channels close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for
          expressed spots, and it also permits us to compare
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> across arrays. After normalization,
          any spot whose normalized intensity remained below the
          threshold value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> was considered to be undetectable,
          and its value was replaced by the threshold value. In our
          arrays, a normalized value of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 corresponds roughly to</NUMEX>
          a spot whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S/N</ENAMEX> ratio equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and thus any spot whose
          background-corrected intensity falls below this threshold
          cannot be reliably distinguished from background noise.
          Finally the background-corrected, normalized signal
          intensities were log-transformed (base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) for further
          analysis.
        
        
          Northern blotting analysis
          The sequencing verified cDNAs used to print the
          microarrays were used as templates and the probes were
          labeled using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling System</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>). For northern blotting, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          electrophorized on a denaturing agarose gel, transferred
          to nylon membrane, and hybridized to 33P labeled cDNA
          probes as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Western blotting analysis
          For western blotting, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total cellular protein
          was run on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gel, transferred to a nylon
          membrane, and incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IGFBP2 antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>
          Biotechnology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>) following the procedure as described
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry assay
          Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were first embedded to paraffin block and
          sections cut and mounted onto microscope slides. The
          presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S100</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFAP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IGFBP2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antigens</ENAMEX> was detected
          by their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> following standard
