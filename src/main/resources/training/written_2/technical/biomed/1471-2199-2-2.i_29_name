        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer</ENAMEX> evolves from the accumulation of mutations and
        the deregulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of genes, oncogenes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes. The large majority of breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> arise in epithelia of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>, and they are
        thought to evolve from hyperplasia with atypia to carcinoma
        in situ, invasive carcinoma, and, finally, metastatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The molecular mechanisms leading to breast
        malignancies are unclear, but many genetic abnormalities
        and epigenetic factors have been implicated, including
        changes affecting known <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes ( 
        p53 , 
        BRCA1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA2</TIMEX> ,

        [reviewed in ref. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>]. Membrane localization renders AKT
        permissive to phosphorylation by phosphatidyl

        the activation loop and at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ser473</ENAMEX> near the carboxyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX>. Phosphorylation activates the kinase domain of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX>, which, in turn, phosphorylates target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serine</ENAMEX> and threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Substrates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> include

        androgen-independent prostate cell lines [reviewed in ref.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>].
        Consistent with the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> as a lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphatase</ENAMEX>,
        
        PTEN -deficient human and mouse cells
        have elevated levels of intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PtdIns</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,4,5</NUMEX>)P3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>,

        absence of growth factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>]. The relationship
        between components of this pathway is also conserved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>.
        A germline mutation in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> is associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multi-neoplastic</ENAMEX>, autosomally dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">syndromes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cowden disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bannayan-Zonana</ENAMEX> syndrome (also
        known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bannayan-Riley</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ruvalcaba</ENAMEX> syndrome), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-50%</NUMEX> of
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> gene is also frequently deleted
        or mutated in a variety of sporadic human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">malignancies</ENAMEX>,
        such as glioblastoma and carcinomas of the prostate,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endometrium</ENAMEX> and breast. Although somatic mutations in the
        gene have been detected in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX>,
        loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> locus (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10q23</NUMEX>) is frequently
        found (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40%</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of breast tumors have no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detectable</ENAMEX>, or reduced, levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein product</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21, 22</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> independent mouse lines carrying inactivating 
        Pten mutations have been made [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> homozygous for these 
        Pten mutations die during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenesis</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months of age</TIMEX>, heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        develop tumors of the lymphoid system, colon, uterus, and
        adrenal medulla with very high penetrance, and tumors of
        the prostate and thyroid with lower penetrance. While
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">benign mammary lesions</ENAMEX>, usually fibroadenomas, are found in
        female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months of age</TIMEX>, few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> develop
        ductal carcinomas [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>, unpublished; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>], which
        account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 85%</NUMEX> of human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>.
        In an effort to develop a model for studying the effects
        of 
        Pten inactivation in mammary
        oncogenesis, we have introduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional</NUMEX> genetic
        alteration, an MMTV- 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>, by breeding 
        Pten heterozygotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] with MMTV- 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transgenic (TG) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        Female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> harboring the 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> develop extensive
        mammary hyperplasia early in life, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of them develop
        mammary ductal carcinomas by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months of age</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transgene</ENAMEX> has been shown to collaborate with 
        Fgf-3 and inactivation of 
        p53 to accelerate the appearance of
        mammary tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 30</TIMEX>]. After a mutant allele of 
        Pten was crossed into 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we found that ductal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> appeared earlier than either alteration alone
        and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at the 
        Pten locus occurred in the majority
        of these tumors, suggesting a selective growth advantage in
        cells that lack 
        Pten functions.
      
      
        Results
        
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have been used to
        assess the functions of a number of genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinogenesis</ENAMEX> because tumors appear with
        predictable kinetics. The median age at which tumors are
        detected is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-6 months</TIMEX> in MMTV- 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 30, 31</TIMEX>].
        After one mutated allele of 
        Pten was bred into this transgenic
        line, tumors appeared significantly earlier than in sibling
        females harboring only a MMTV- 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.

        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TG</ENAMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> formed tumors by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.5 months</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.5 months earlier</TIMEX> than 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). While it
        took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> for the entire cohort (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) of 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with a wild type 
        Pten background to develop tumors,
        all 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt-1 TG,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> +/- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> showed tumors by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of age</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> each of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> without a 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> were monitored for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10.5 months</TIMEX>, but none developed any palpable
        mammary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. These observations differ from a recent
        report that one of the other two 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> +/- lines develops fibroadenomas
        and adenocarcinomas in the mammary tissue after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> of
        age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The lack of a mammary phenotype in our studies
        could be due to differences in the targeting constructs,
        the genetic backgrounds, or even environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year of age</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 15%</NUMEX> of 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> have been reported to
        develop mammary tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 31</TIMEX>]. In our cross, one of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tumors from 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, in an otherwise wild
        type background, was a mammary carcinoma; the other three
        tumors were salivary in origin, with a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histopathology</ENAMEX> to the mammary lesion. The appearance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> was greatly accelerated in the 
        Pten heterozygous background (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        1B). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Fifty percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> developed tumors by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5.5 months</TIMEX>
        of age, and all developed tumors within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months</TIMEX>. As in
        the case of 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> without 
        Pten mutations, the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14/22</NUMEX>) arose in the salivary tissue; only a small
        number of tumors (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/22</NUMEX>) were mammary in origin, and,
        interestingly, some (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6/22</NUMEX>) were bilateral or unilateral
        muzzle tumors of epithelial origin, similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histopathologically</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> found in mammary and
        salivary tissues.
        To determine if the wild type allele of 
        Pten was inactivated in tumors
        arising in a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> +/- background, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> tumors from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt-1 TG,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were examined for LOH
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southern</ENAMEX> hybridization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> tumors had lost the wild
        type 
        Pten allele (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2for an example
        of the analysis). This result suggests that, in
        tumorigenesis, cells that lack a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> of 
        Pten have a significant proliferative
        advantage over the cells that retain the normal copy of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> .
        Histological examination showed that tumors from 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, regardless of 
        Pten status, were adenocarcinomas
        with cribriform, cystic and focal papillary growth
        patterns. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> tumors that were 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt-1 TG,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> appeared to have a
        higher nuclear grade, more cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stroma</ENAMEX> and a more
        infiltrative pattern compared to the tumors without a 
        Pten defect (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), suggesting a
        more aggressive phenotype.
        In human cancer, a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene can be
        inactivated by mutations, chromosomal loss, promoter
        silencing, and other means. To determine if the Pten
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was produced in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt-1 TG,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> +/- tumors that did not undergo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were analyzed using an immunohistochemical
        assay with a polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit antibody</ENAMEX>. Abundant amounts
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> were detected in mammary ducts from wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>.
        Pten was detected, at reduced levels, in both hyperplastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ducts</ENAMEX> and mammary tumors that did not have LOH at the 
        Pten allele (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), suggesting that
        Pten was, indeed, made from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> allele. Similar low
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> were also detected in mammary ductal
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in 
        Pten <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heterozygous mice</ENAMEX> that did not
        have a 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> does not influence 
        Pten expression. As expected, Pten
        was not detected in tumors that had undergone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at the 
        Pten locus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E).
        Inactivation of 
        Pten promotes membrane recruitment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> and its subsequent activation by phosphorylation at
        Ser473 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thr308</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 13</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> human isoforms
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> have been found to be deregulated in human breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33, 34</TIMEX>]. To determine if activated AKT
        was increased in tumors that had a 
        Pten defect, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stained</ENAMEX> using an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> that specifically detects AKT1
        phosphorylated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser 473</NUMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKT2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AKT3</ENAMEX> phosphorylated
        at equivalent sites). Tumors that were 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt-1 TG,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> displayed staining
        of phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A). Surprisingly, the staining
        was patchy, suggesting additional factors may be required
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> activation. As expected, phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> was

        squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of various sizes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D). These squamous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> were usually multi-focal and located both at the

        glands free of adenocarcinomas.
        Since 
        Pten mutations are usually found in

        inhibit cell spreading, migration, and invasion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>],
        it is possible that the tumors from

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are valuable research tools for the study
        of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis and for the
        testing and screening of cancer therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> targeted
        to specific oncogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. In order to produce such a
        model for studying the effects of 
        Pten mutations in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, we
        have crossed 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> heterozygous
        for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice transgenic</ENAMEX> for MMTV- 
        Wnt-1 and heterozygous for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> developed mammary
        adenocarcinomas much earlier than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> carrying either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> alone. The majority of tumors in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt-1 TG,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had lost the wild type
        allele of 
        Pten , suggesting that the complete
        inactivation of 
        Pten function provides an additional
        growth advantage to these tumors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at the 
        Pten locus has recently been reported
        in mammary tumors arising in 
        Pten <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heterozygous mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], but
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> developed tumors before the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, and, in our cross, none of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> without the 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> had a palpable
        mammary tumor before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 30 weeks</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at the 
        Pten locus has also been reported in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adrenal</ENAMEX> and lymphatic tumors, but not in uterine tumors and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate lesions</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KP & RP</ENAMEX>,
        submitted; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activated AKT</ENAMEX> was more abundant in tumors that were 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wnt-1 TG,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pten +/-</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>, as has been shown
        for uterine tumors in 
        Pten <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">heterozygous mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>,
        submitted). The presence of areas unstained with antibody
        specific for phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> suggests that additional
        factors other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> may influence the activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX>.
        Neither apoptosis nor proliferation, as determined by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> assay and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KI67</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>, was significantly
        different between tumors heterozygous for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> (with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>) and those
        without a 
        Pten defect. This result may seem
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paradoxical</ENAMEX> since increased phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX>, due to
        inactivation of 
        Pten , suppresses apoptosis and
        promotes proliferation. However, tumors in 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in a wild type 
        Pten background already have highly
        suppressed apoptosis and accelerated proliferation rates,
        and any incremental changes, if present, may be difficult
        to detect with our current assays. Nonetheless, a seemingly
        minor difference in either apoptosis or proliferation could
        have a dramatic impact on tumor growth over time.
        Accelerated appearance of mammary adenocarcinomas in the
        presence of a 
        Pten mutation suggests a synergy
        between 
        Pten inactivation and the 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>. The apparent
        cooperation of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genetic factors is further
        strengthened by our finding that the majority of tumors
        arising in a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> +/- background have lost the
        wild type allele. To date, heterozygous inactivation of any
        of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes implicated in breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, including 
        P53, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brca1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Brca2</TIMEX> , and 
        Rb , has failed to cooperate with 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in promoting the appearance of
        mammary tumors [reviewed in ref. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>]. Therefore, it is
        possible that the signal pathway controlled by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> is one of the preferred partners
        of the 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pathway in cancer progression,
        although it remains possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at the 
        Pten locus is more likely to occur
        than for the other alleles crossed into 
        Wnt- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Even though 
        Wnt-1 has not been directly
        implicated in human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, many components of the Wnt
        signaling pathway (such as Î²-catenin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX>, 
        c-myc, and 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin</TIMEX> D <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) are involved in human
        tumors including breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [reviewed in ref. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the goals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> modeling efforts is to provide
        an opportunity for pre-clinical testing of generalized or
        mechanism-specific therapeutics in a defined genetic
        setting. Many human breast tumors have reduced levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX>, hence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of the cell signaling pathways
        affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTEN</ENAMEX> could be tested in the model we have
        developed. One such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> is the rapamycin analog
        CCI779, which has been suggested to inhibit the AKT
        signaling pathway, probably through inhibition of mTOR
        (target of rapamycin), a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> [reviewed
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ref. 41</TIMEX>]. CCI779 has been shown to have inhibitory
        effects on the growth of 
        Pten -deficient tumors in the uterus
        and prostate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (KP & <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX>, submitted; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Neshat</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">& C. Sawyers</ENAMEX>, submitted). Since tumors arise rapidly
        after a copy of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX> is inactivated, and with
        predictable kinetics, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> may be useful for testing
        the efficacy of these therapies.
        Results presented here and published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 26</TIMEX>] have clearly demonstrated the significant
        impact of 
        Pten on mammary oncogenesis. Future
        testing will examine the tumorigenic effects caused by
        other kinds of genetic damage in the signaling pathways
        affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX>-directed gene delivery system
        [reviewed in ref. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>] can be used to introduce viral
        vectors carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding an activated form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI3K</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> substrates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKT</ENAMEX> into the mammary
        tissue of 
        Wnt-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> TG <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This would allow the
        testing of therapeutic interventions directed to specific
        steps of the signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pten</ENAMEX>.
