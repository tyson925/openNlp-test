        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX> is a major cause of death among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and worldwide [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . While cures are
        probable if the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is detected early and remains
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">localized</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will succumb to the disease if the
        primary tumor metastasizes to secondary organs. Although
        significant progress has been made in detecting and
        treating the primary tumor, the ability to predict the
        metastatic behavior of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s tumor and to eradicate
        or control recurrent disseminated malignancy remain major
        clinical challenges in oncology.
        We have previously characterized an experimental system
        that enables comparative molecular screening and functional
        evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> breast metastasis-related genes in
        an isogenic background [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> independent clones of
        opposing metastatic phenotype were derived from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435</ENAMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> cell line (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metasatic M-4A4</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonmetastatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NM-2C5</ENAMEX> cell lines). When inoculated into the
        mammary fat pad of athymic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, both cell lines form
        primary tumors. While clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-4A4</ENAMEX> aggressively metastasizes
        to the lung and lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NM-2C5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> is entirely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonmetastatic</ENAMEX>. Initial comparative gene expression analysis
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clones revealed the secreted, integrin-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein osteopontin</ENAMEX> (OPN) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] to be significantly
        increased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the metastatic M-4A4</TIMEX> cell line. Conversely,
        the expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and of
        tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TYRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was markedly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> in the nonmetastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NM-2C5</ENAMEX> cell line [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5</NUMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> is a secreted glycophosphoprotein expressed by a
        number of cell types, including leukocytes and epithelial
        lineages, and it has been implicated biologically in bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, in immune system regulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , and in
        multiple mechanisms through signal transduction via its
        binding to integrins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> has been detected in
        primary breast tumors and is elevated in the plasma of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] , but an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between elevated levels of primary tumor OPN
        and metastatic burden has not been well established.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> is a homotrimeric multidomain glycoprotein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesized</ENAMEX> and secreted by numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types, including
        platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells and keratinocytes [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] . Due to its interaction with a wide variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> has been implicated in a number of
        biological processes including coagulation, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>,
        the modulation of cell-cell and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-matrix interactions,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of tumor growth and metastasis, and angiogenesis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation has been
        achieved 
        in vivo by systemic treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1 peptide mimetics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , but a correlation between
        primary tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> expression and poor prognosis has not
        been clearly established [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . While there are reports
        that these molecules can originate from tumor cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        , the majority of reports have suggested that the major
        source of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> is tumor-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stroma</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] or infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The melanogenic enzymes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-2</ENAMEX> are
        well-characterized differentiation antigens recognized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibodies and T</ENAMEX> cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with melanoma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        The evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> expression in human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>
        has not been documented to date.
        The aim of the present work was to examine the cellular
        distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> in human breast
        tissue, and to determine whether the relative expression
        level of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was associated with malignancy
        or breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor metastasis</ENAMEX>. To overcome the problem of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> and stromal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> contamination in homogenized
        tissue specimens, specific cell types were isolated by
        laser capture microdissection (LCM) prior to analysis. We
        used a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">real-time</ENAMEX>, quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (qPCR) analysis of material
        obtained from a panel of primary breast infiltrating ductal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> and nodal metastases, and compared the target
        gene expression levels with those found in nonmalignant
        diseased tissue and in samples of normal breast tissue.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Tissue samples
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-eight</NUMEX> frozen human breast tissue specimens were
          evaluated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX>, qPCR and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> primary
          tumors of infiltrating ductal carcinomas (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> primary
          tumors with metastasis and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> primary tumors without
          known metastasis), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> matched nodal metastases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroadenomas</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> normal breast tissues (obtained
          from reduction mammoplasty). In addition, eight
          tumor-associated stromal components (including
          fibroblasts, endothelial cells and inflammatory cells)
          were microdissected from primary tumors without known
          metastases for analysis.
          Breast tissues were obtained from surgical specimens
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Radcliffe Hospital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> and at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSD Medical Center</ENAMEX>. Samples were obtained in random
          order from the residue of tissue used for pathological
          diagnosis that would otherwise have been discarded.
          Tissues were snap-frozen immediately after resection and
          were stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> pairs
          of additional formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
          specimens of primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas and
          of matched nodal metastasis were also used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> only
          (total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Histological</ENAMEX> diagnosis of
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H&E</ENAMEX>-stained cryostat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sections</ENAMEX> (JWR). The histological grade was assigned
          according to the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom-Richardson</ENAMEX> grading scheme
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Tissue samples were obtained and processed under
          approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSD Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> for
          studying existing tissues (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#011246X</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Laser capture microdissection
          The total number of samples studied using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> and qPCR
          were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">76</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were microdissected to specifically
          enrich for cells of epithelial origin, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> samples
          were microdissected to obtain tumor-associated stroma).
          Frozen tissues were embedded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optimal Cutting</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Temperature Compound</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">OCT; Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and held at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX> prior to sectioning.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX>-micrometer cryosections were mounted onto uncoated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscope</ENAMEX> slides, immediately fixed by immersion in
          acetone for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> s and washed with RNAse-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
          Staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H&E</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> was performed for morphological evaluation. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydration</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> and in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were cleared in xylene for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> and were air-dried. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> was performed with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PixCell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I LCM System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arcturus Engineering</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain</ENAMEX>
          View, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocols,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-5000</TIMEX> cell equivalents were dissected from
          each slide for subsequent analysis.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction and cDNA synthesis
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from frozen breast tissues and
          laser-captured materials using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StrataPrep Total RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          DNase-treated to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contaminating DNA</ENAMEX> and the yield
          was measured spectrophotometrically. Single-stranded cDNA
          was synthesized from total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMLV</ENAMEX> reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retroscript RT</ENAMEX> kit; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Primer</ENAMEX> sets for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX>, the
          housekeeping gene) were designed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primer Express</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 1.5</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>,
          CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The qPCR was performed on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX> Biosystems
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRISM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7700 Sequence Detection System</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green</ENAMEX> ®I
          chemistry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequence Detection Software</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to data collection and analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosystems</ENAMEX>).
          The optimal primer concentrations for the reference
          and target genes in the final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction were
          determined, and both dissociation curves (ABI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dissociation Curves</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> software; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and agarose gel
          electrophoretic analyses were applied to confirm the
          specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products and to check for the presence
          of primer-dimer formations in the absence of a template.
          Nontemplate control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions were always run in
          triplicate for every gene-specific reaction mix.
          Standard curves (cycle threshold values versus
          template concentration) were prepared for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> and
          for the endogenous reference (GAPDH) using cDNA from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435</ENAMEX> breast cells as the calibrator. For each
          experimental sample, the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> and endogenous
          reference were determined from the respective standard
          curves, and then the target amount was divided by the
          endogenous reference amount to obtain a normalized target
          value. The sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> pairs used for
          each gene are as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX>,

          Immunohistochemistry
          All tissue specimens (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> FFPE
          samples) were evaluated immunohistochemically. Monoclonal
          antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> were purchased

          antibody reactions were optimized using the DAKO LSAB
          plus kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carpinteria</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for both frozen and

          was optimized using the secondary biotinylated rabbit
          anti-rat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:600</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">streptavidin</ENAMEX>/horseradish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:400</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO</ENAMEX>). Primary tumors recovered from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nude mice inoculated</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the M-4A4</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NM-2C5 MDA-MB-435</ENAMEX>
          clones [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] were used as positive controls.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tumor specimen staining</ENAMEX> was scored as positive or
          negative. Positive staining was defined as ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the
          tumor cells or the benign epithelial components examined
          having distinct cytoplasmic staining. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> additional

          method now described to assess the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the
          antibodies on archived tissues.
          Serial frozen sections were cut for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> and for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM/RT</ENAMEX>-qPCR for concurrent analysis. For frozen tissues,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 μm cryostat</ENAMEX> sections (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leica Microsystems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heidelberger</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>) were briefly fixed in acetone. Primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were incubated on slides for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>. After
          several washings with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, secondary antibodies
          conjugated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">streptavidin</ENAMEX>/horseradish peroxidase were
          added for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min-1 hour</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were washed and
          stained with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,3</NUMEX>'-diaminobenzidine (DAKO) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min and</TIMEX>
          were then counterstained with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gills II</ENAMEX> hematoxylin

          For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFPE</ENAMEX> tissues, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 μm</ENAMEX> sections were cut and placed on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">aminopropyltriethoxysilane</NUMEX>-coated slides. After
          deparaffinization, the endogenous peroxidase was removed

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Antigen retrieval was performed by
          steam heating for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> min. After sections were cooled to
          room temperature, the background staining was reduced by
          incubation of serum against specific secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          Slides were incubated with primary antibodies for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>.
          After washing with deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>-specific secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were added and the
          antibody <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was visualized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,3</NUMEX>'-diaminobenzidine.
          The nuclei were counterstained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill's</ENAMEX> II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> in human breast tissues
          The efficacy and specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and TYRP-1
          antibodies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> was tested by analysis of frozen tissue
          xenografts of known target gene expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5</NUMEX> ] .
          Positive cytoplasmic staining was detected with the OPN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) primary breast carcinomas
          with nodal metastases. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> example is
          depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six of 26</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>) metastatic tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>) primary tumors without
          metastases were OPN-positive. Incubation of fibroadenoma
          and normal breast tissue specimens with the OPN antibody
          also produced positive staining in the epithelial cells
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> of nonmalignant cases (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five fibroadenomas</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> normal breast tissues). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> was also regularly
          observed in tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Although difficult to quantitate, a
          trend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> localization towards the epithelial layer
          but not the myoepithelial layer was observed in normal
          breast tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Overall, the degree and intensity
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> expression was qualitatively equal in samples of
          adenomas, adenocarcinomas and nodal metastases from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disseminated disease</ENAMEX>. The majority of
          primary carcinomas (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>) that were positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> also
          had concurrent OPN-positive metastases.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> staining of breast tissue sections revealed
          intracytoplasmic staining of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>)
          node-positive primary carcinomas and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 of 26</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX>. In this case, all positive primaries had
          positive associated metastases, although some metastatic
          tumors with positive TSP-1 expression had negative TSP-1
          stain in their primary tumors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TSP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was
          positive in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> primary carcinomas without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX>). Very weak staining was observed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroadenoma</ENAMEX> and normal tissues, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> was
          detected in breast tissue stromal components.
          A high percentage of node-positive primary tumors
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>), metastatic carcinomas (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73% and 100%</NUMEX> concordance
          between primary tumor and associated metastasis,
          respectively), primary carcinomas without metastases
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX>), benign breast specimens (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>) and normal (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>)
          breast specimens were positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1 staining</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was confined to the cytoplasm and to
          the epithelial components of the tissue. The staining
          achieved with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> was relatively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneous</ENAMEX> across the tumor in positive cases, and no
          qualitative differences in staining were apparent at the
          invasive edge of the carcinomas. No correlation was found
          between protein expression and tumor grade in the
          infiltrating ductal carcinomas, and no consistent
          qualitative differences were revealed between primary
          tissues with or without associated metastases.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> and qPCR analysis of breast tissues
          While providing information on the cellular
          distribution of target gene expression, the technique of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-color chromogenic IHC staining can result in highly
          variable data across samples, and it relies on visual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'scoring</ENAMEX>' that is relatively subjective. To obtain
          accurate, quantitative information on target gene
          expression we employed qPCR technology. The selection of
          specific cell types from the heterogeneous cellular
          composition of the tissue specimens was attained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX>.
          This procedure allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> mRNA
          analysis in specific cells of interest in each case,
          eliminating the contribution from normal adjacent cells
          that could cause difficulties in interpretation.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of interest in the majority of cases were
          those of epithelial origin, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> specimens were also
          used for the isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>-associated stroma
          (fibroblast, endothelial and inflammatory cells) for
          comparison. We measured the expression levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1 genes</ENAMEX> using a quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-qPCR</ENAMEX>). This analysis, in line with the findings of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> data, confirms that breast tumor cells themselves
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesize OPN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> (in addition to
          tumor-infiltrating macrophages in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>).
          Normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nonmalignant breast epithelia</ENAMEX> and stromal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> expressed reduced levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> and TYRP-1
          transcripts. Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3, 4demonstrate</TIMEX> the differential
          expression pattern and the quantitative expression level
          of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in human breast tissues.
          Relative to the GAPDH transcript levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> expression
          was found to be ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> expression in
          all tissues examined. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> expression was comparable
          with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> in malignant cells but was at the
          limit of detection in normal and benign epithelia and
          stromal components.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> mRNA was found to be present in all microdissected
          tissue samples examined. Significantly elevated (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~5</NUMEX>-fold)
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> transcripts were observed in cells of
          epithelial origin dissected from primary carcinomas and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> metastases over nonmalignant cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. All
          primary tumors combined ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.017</NUMEX>) and all metastases ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0082</NUMEX>) exhibited significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevated OPN</ENAMEX> expression compared with normal epithelia
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, there was no difference in OPN
          expression between primary carcinomas with metastases and
          those without metastases. Nor was there a quantitative
          difference in OPN expression between primary carcinomas
          and matched metastases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          While trace amounts were detected due to the
          sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification, thrombospondin
          transcripts were essentially absent from breast tissue
          epithelia obtained from normal and benign specimens, and
          there were no appreciable levels detected in stromal
          tissue components. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> levels were
          significantly raised in malignant tissue epithelial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> levels were significantly higher
          (~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX>) in all primary tumors ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0017</NUMEX>) and in all metastases (
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>) over normal breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelia</ENAMEX>. In line with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> patterns of expression,
          there was no significant difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> levels
          between primary tumors with or without metastases, nor
          between primary carcinomas and associated metastases.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> expression was higher than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> but
          lower than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold to 50-fold</NUMEX>). While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TYRP</ENAMEX>-1
          transcripts could be detected in all tissues examined
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), including malignant and nonmalignant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>,
          there were no significant quantitative differences
          revealed between the types of tissue.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms
        involved in metastatic spread is needed to facilitate
        advances in prognostic evaluation for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        and in the design of therapeutic interventions to inhibit
        the process. In an effort to establish a methodological
        framework for analysis of the molecules and the mechanisms
        involved in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> multistep process, we previously
        developed a well-defined experimental system in which the
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes can be screened and tested [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        By serial dilution cloning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435</ENAMEX> tumor cell
        line and screening by orthotopic implantation into the
        mammary fat pad of athymic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we derived a pair of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast tumor</ENAMEX> cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-4A4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NM-2C5</ENAMEX>) that originate
        from the same breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>, but that have diametrically
        opposite metastatic capabilities. Through multiple
        molecular analyses we have identified and verified a number
        of genes whose expression correlates with the metastatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> in this xenograft model. The expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins TSP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> were found to correlate with the
        nonmetastatic phenotype, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> was significantly
        elevated in the metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>. These findings
        prompted us to investigate the occurrence and distribution
        of these molecules in human breast tissues. The
        investigative approach was designed to detect and quantify
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> molecules in specific breast tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that were not previously available.
        Having detected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> immunohistochemically
        in normal, benign and malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast epithelia</ENAMEX>, the
        quantitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was achieved
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> and qPCR. This technique allows for the accurate
        procurement of cells from specific microscopic regions of
        tissue sections, and therefore enables the molecular
        genetic analysis of pure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of malignant breast
        cells in their native tissue environment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . This
        technical advance helps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to avoid the variation and
        subjectivity associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX>, and to overcome the
        limitations of data interpretation caused by tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> and normal stromal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> contamination in
        homogenized tissue specimens. Coupled with qPCR, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> can
        reveal significant differences in specific gene expression
        that are not accessible with relatively insensitive IHC
        alone.
        We have demonstrated that human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epithelia</ENAMEX> can
        themselves synthesize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> and, to a lesser extent, TSP-1
        and TYRP-1 
        in vivo , and that elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> levels are indicative of malignancy. Significant OPN
        expression has been reported in a number of breast
        epithelial cell lines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , and so it is known that
        cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast epithelial origin</ENAMEX> can synthesize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> in
        certain conditions. But it is possible that 
        in vitro OPN expression is a
        phenomenon of cell culture or that OPN-positive cells have
        a selective growth advantage during extended passage.
        Synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> was also observed in infiltrating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> and macrophages, a factor that would seriously
        compromise efforts to quantify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> in homogenized tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX>. Such analysis would highlight tumors with a high
        level of infiltrating inflammatory cells rather than
        evaluate the levels of the marker molecule(s) in the
        proliferative epithelia of a lesion.
        As observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX>, tumor-infiltrating inflammatory
        cells were presumably the stromal source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>. Transcript
        levels in normal and fibroadenoma epithelia were equal to
        those found in isolated stroma, indicating that the
        scattered infiltrating macrophages (not lymphocytes) have
        relatively high OPN expression. The presence of
        inflammatory infiltration is a serious problem in the
        molecular analysis of tissue samples if the tissue is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenized</ENAMEX> prior to analysis. The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> in
        inflammatory cells highlights the advantage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microdissection</ENAMEX> in this analytical context.
        High levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> cell lines appear to
        correlate with a more aggressive 
        in vivo phenotype [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 20</ENAMEX> ] .
        Transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> expression constructs into cells
        producing noninvasive mammary epithelial tumors has been
        reported to convert them to a malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phenotype</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 21</ENAMEX> ]
        . Furthermore, transfection of antisense OPN constructs or
        OPN-targeting ribozymes into transformed tumorigenic cells
        can result in impaired anchorage-independent growth, as
        well as in diminished tumor-forming ability 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> is also
        typically overexpressed in human tumors, including breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 24</NUMEX> ] . However, the source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> in primary
        breast tumors was originally thought to be infiltrating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> rather than tumor cells themselves [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        By applying 
        in situ hybridization, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuck</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> identified breast tumor cells as a source of OPN
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Using a semiquantitative scoring system to
        evaluate immunohistochemical staining, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        found a correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> positivity (defined as
        ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of tumor cells in a section staining for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>) in
        lymph node-negative primary breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinomas</ENAMEX> and patient
        survival, suggesting that tumor cells with elevated OPN
        levels may behave differently with regard to disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Another recent study showed
        immunohistochemically that while OPN <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is expressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weakly</ENAMEX> in normal breast tissue, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> is expressed strongly
        (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> tumor cell staining) in pregnant/lactating tissue
        and in the majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinomas</ENAMEX>. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> also found that the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> on tumor
        cells is correlated with patient demise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        Our LCM-mediated transcript detection acts as an
        important confirmation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast tumor cell</ENAMEX> OPN synthesis
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> analysis does not rule out the possibility that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secreted proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> are sequestered by
        the tumor cells from the local environment. Experiments
        with cell lines show that tumor cells can bind soluble OPN
        and can migrate towards an OPN concentration gradient [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] ; sequestration from the extracellular matrix 
        in vivo is thus pertinent. In the
        present study, the epithelial layer appeared to express
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OPN</ENAMEX> than the myoepithelial cells, suggesting some OPN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> or induction via the myoepithelial layer or
        via stromal interactions. Unfortunately, the resolution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCM</ENAMEX> does not enable the selection of epithelial cells from
        myoepithelial cells and so we were unable to confirm this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitatively</ENAMEX>.
        The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> expression on tumor growth and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastasis</ENAMEX> has been examined 
        in vivo by orthotopic inoculation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TSP-1-overexpressing MDA-MB-435</ENAMEX> cells. A dose-dependent
        inhibition of spontaneous pulmonary metastases was
        reported, but this was paralleled by an inhibition of
        primary tumor growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> has also been
        implicated in the phenomenon of concomitant tumor
        resistance. This refers to the ability of some large
        primary tumors to hold smaller, distant tumors in check,
        preventing their progressive growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volpert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        demonstrated this phenomenon using tumors formed by the
        human fibrosarcoma line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HT1080</NUMEX> in nude <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and obtained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicating that it was caused by secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> by
        the primary tumor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Some of the properties
        attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> are conflicting, however; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TSP-1</ENAMEX> can be
        both adhesive and anti-adhesive 
        in vitro , can stimulate or inhibit
        angiogenesis, and can inhibit or enhance proteolytic enzyme
        activity. The composition of the matrix, the availability
        of cytokines and proteases, and the expression of various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in a given cellular environment might explain
        these opposing functions.
        Our findings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MDA-MB-435</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">metastasis model</ENAMEX> are in
        agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> playing a role in the reduction of
        metastatic potential [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinically</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> expression
        is inversely correlated with tumor grade and survival rate
        in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] , most probably because of
        the anti-angiogenic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX>. A recent study
        confirms this to be the case in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, where
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> in stroma adjacent to ductal carcinoma 
        in situ is lost in cases with more
        aggressive histological features [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . There are also
        reports, however, that fibroblast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> can induce matrix
        metalloproteinase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> in breast tumor cells and gastric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> tumor cells, and this in turn may lead to a more
        invasive phenotype [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 31</NUMEX> ] . In the present study, TSP-1
        was not expressed differentially in the stroma of benign
        tissue specimens or malignant tissue specimens, nor in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelial</ENAMEX> component of breast tumors with or without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX>. The increased levels observed in malignant
        breast epithelia suggest a shift in the balance between the
        anti-angiogenic and proinvasive effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor progression</ENAMEX>. The precise biological role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> in
        human tumor progression awaits more definitive study.
        In the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was present, but at
        very low levels, in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> tissue, in associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stroma</ENAMEX> and in normal breast tissues. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> reveals
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1 protein staining</ENAMEX> is easily detectable in many
        samples. The melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-2</ENAMEX> are well-characterized differentiation antigens
        recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and T cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanoma</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> is a type I membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expressed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanomas</ENAMEX> and normal melanocytes that was originally
        characterized as an oxidase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX> biosynthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinically</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> is thought to be important as a
        melanoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> that is highly antigenic to cytotoxic T
        cells, providing a potential target for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">melanoma</ENAMEX> vaccine
        development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> appears to be less expressed in
        advanced primary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> and metastases of human cutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanoma</ENAMEX> and uveal melanoma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Primary melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples express TYRP-1</ENAMEX> transcripts at higher levels than
        melanoma metastases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC</ENAMEX> analysis of malignant
        melanocytic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> has shown that the invasive cells of
        primary melanomas are TYRP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-negative [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Our finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> is also expressed in the poorly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastatic</ENAMEX> or noninvasive cell lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NM-2C5</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T47D</TIMEX>,
        MCF7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DU145</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , which are derived from human breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> and prostate tumors that are nonmetastatic,
        indicates that this molecule is not exclusively expressed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">melanocytic</ENAMEX> lineage. It has long been known
        that the sera of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who suffer from melanoma or
        mammary carcinoma show higher tyrosinase activity than
        normal sera [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] but, to our knowledge, this is the first
        report of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> expression in human breast duct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX>. The biological function of and any clinical
        significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> expression in normal or malignant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinomas</ENAMEX> are presently unknown.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have quantitatively analyzed transcripts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX>, of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TYRP-1</ENAMEX> in microdissected human breast tissues.
        Elevated levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TSP-1</ENAMEX> expression in primary and
        metastatic carcinomas suggest that these genes may be
        necessary for, but not sufficient for, dissemination. Tumor
        cells that synthesize matrix-associated factors such as OPN
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> may increase their ability to independently
        manipulate their surroundings, encouraging invasion and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>. These studies suggest that the quantitative
        analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPN</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TSP-1</ENAMEX> may be clinically useful in
        identifying malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions over benign lesions</ENAMEX> but they
        are not, as yet, promising markers for the evaluation of
        primary tumors for metastatic propensity.
