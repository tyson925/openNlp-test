        CFEOM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that has been
        linked to the pericentromere of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, flanked by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker D12S1584</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D12S1668</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">q arm</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. The clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> consists of congenital,
        bilateral ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia, with the
        eyes partially or completely fixed in a hypotrophic or
        downward position. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autopsy</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> appear to be
        lacking the superior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of cranial nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, which
        innervates the levator and superior rectus muscles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Whether this disease is caused by a primary defect in the
        nerve or the muscle remains unclear. The disease was
        initially linked to an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> centiMorgan region spanning the
        centromere of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, and then further refined to a
        critical region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Yeast and bacterial
        artificial chromosome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>) contigs have been
        generated and a positional cloning approach to identify the
        CFEOM1 causative gene is ongoing.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarcospan</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the dystrophin associated
        protein complex present in skeletal and extraocular muscle
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarcospan</ENAMEX> is most tightly associated with the
        transmembrane sarcoglycan subcomplex, mutation of which
        causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular</ENAMEX> dystrophy
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LGMD2C-2F</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Primary mutation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î± -</NUMEX> Î´
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sarcoglycan</ENAMEX> leads to a variable degree of secondary
        instability of sarcospan and the non-mutant sarcoglycans.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarcospan</ENAMEX> is homologous to the tetraspanin superfamily,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of which have been shown to facilitate both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX>-membrane and membrane-proximal protein
        interactions involved in many different cellular processes
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarcospan</ENAMEX> had previously been identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krag</ENAMEX>, a
        gene that is co-amplified with Ki-ras in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y1</TIMEX> murine
        adrenal carcinoma cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>]. Portions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>'s genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> were elucidated at that time, and
        the gene was localized to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12p11.2</NUMEX>.
        Given the genomic localization of sarcospan in the
        critical region defined for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>, and its association
        with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to be involved in muscular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, sarcospan has been proposed as a candidate
        disease gene for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. We have refined the
        previously published genomic structure of sarcospan more
        fully and screened for mutations in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with
        CFEOM1. We have also generated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> that recognize
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sarcospan</ENAMEX> and examined extraocular muscle samples
        from CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        We find sarcospan to be unmutated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> CFEOM1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> studied and sarcospan immunoreactivity to be
        identical in control and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CFEOM1 extraocular</ENAMEX> muscle.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarcospan</ENAMEX> is also shown to map electronically to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> that
        are considered to be outside of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> critical region.
        These data make it unlikely that sarcospan, or other
        dystrophin associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, are involved in the
        pathogenesis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>.

          gene
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> independent clones were isolated from a human

          within the coding sequence were designed to cross the two
          known intron-exon junctions and other hypothesized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">junctions</ENAMEX>. The sarcospan open reading frame is encoded by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> exon contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">279</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>)
          of coding sequence and is extremely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>/C rich (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>). The

          Although the coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> physical maps
          was nearly complete, only direct sequencing of CFEOM1

        Discussion
        The critical region for the congenital eye movement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disorder</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>, has been reduced to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cM region at the
        centromere of human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. In an effort to
        identify the gene which when mutated gives rise to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>,
        a combination of positional and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene approaches
        has been undertaken. The sarcospan gene is composed of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons that are located on human chromosome 12p11.2
        and the sarcospan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has been shown to be an integral
        component of the sarcoglycan complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 15, 16</ENAMEX>].
        Mutations in any one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this
        complex have been shown to cause muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy</ENAMEX>. As the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extraocular</ENAMEX> muscle is one of the few muscles spared in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</ENAMEX>, the dystrophin associated
        protein complex present in extraocular muscle may respond
        differently to mutation of the complex than other striated
        muscle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. By virtue of its genomic localization and
        expression in extraocular muscle, sarcospan is a candidate
        gene for autosomal dominant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>. We therefore chose to
        study sarcospan more closely within the context of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        Immunofluorescence data showed comparable patterns of
        sarcospan staining in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX> and control patient samples
        implying that there was no haplo-insufficiency, altered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> or increased degradation of the sarcospan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Direct sequencing of the three
        coding exons of sarcospan in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> confirmed that
        they were normal, rendering alteration of the sarcospan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as the primary genetic defect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX> unlikely.
        This conclusion is supported by the electronic localization
        of sarcospan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> outside of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> critical
        region.
        The normal staining pattern of sarcospan in the
        autosomal dominant CFEOM1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> muscle indicates that the
        primary genetic mutation is likely to be found in another,
        unrelated gene. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with autosomal dominant limb
        girdle muscular dystrophy type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1C</ENAMEX>, caused by mutations in
        caveolin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>], or autosomal recessive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LGMD2B</TIMEX>, caused
        by mutations in dysferlin, show normal dystrophin and
        sarcoglycan-sarcospan <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> staining patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        Sarcospan immunoreactivity is altered in both Duchenne
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muscular Dystrophy</ENAMEX> and the sarcoglycanopathies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LGMD2C-F</ENAMEX>)
        and appears to be very sensitive to disturbances in the
        dystrophin associated protein complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Thus the
        finding that sarcospan is normal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX> patient muscle
        suggests that sarcospan itself and the rest of the
        dystrophin associated protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are not involved in
        the pathogenesis of the disease.
        A sarcospan <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mouse</ENAMEX> has recently been generated and
        appears to display a normal phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. This does not,
        however, rule out the possibility of sarcospan playing a
        primary role in a muscle disorder. There may, for example,
        be a homologous tetraspanin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that compensates for
        the absence of sarcospan in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, but not in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. There
        is, of course, also a difference between complete absence
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with an altered sequence. This
        may hold especially true, as sarcospan appears to be member
        of the tetraspanin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which have been
        described as molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facilitators</ENAMEX>; alterations of such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX>'s sequence could affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with which it
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interacts</ENAMEX>. We are therefore expanding our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> analysis
        to include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with other forms of muscular
        abnormalities including unlinked muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophies</ENAMEX>.
        The effort to identify the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> disease gene is
        continuing with analysis of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and expressed
        sequence tags from the critical region at the centromere of
        chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence analysis and protein immunofluorescence
        results that show sarcospan to be normal in CFEOM1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, combined with the localization of sarcospan to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> that are outside of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CFEOM1</NUMEX> critical region, make
        it unlikely that sarcospan is involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CFEOM1</TIMEX>.
