        Squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma of the tongue is a common
        malignancy treated by surgeons. Incidence of tongue cancer
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> highest in the world. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> the
        age adjusted incidence rate is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 14/100,000</NUMEX>
        per/year in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahmedabad</ENAMEX> while among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4/</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mumbai</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trivandrum</ENAMEX> the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tongue cancer</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.2/ 100,000</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4/100,000</NUMEX>
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Tongue is a complex anatomical site and its form and
        function are crucial for efficient swallowing, speech and
        appreciation of taste. In past different methods of
        treatment have been employed but tongue has remained a
        difficult area to assess and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">treat</ENAMEX>. The survival in
        carcinoma of the tongue is poor compared to other subsites
        in oral cavity.
        The distribution of cervical lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX> metastasis from
        squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinoma</ENAMEX> at different subsites in the oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavity</ENAMEX> has been described before [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, there
        are very few studies from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, where the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tongue cancer</ENAMEX> is high. The distribution of metastases
        suggests skip <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> and peppering [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Predicting
        the lymphatic spread from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> of the oral tongue can
        help in choosing the appropriate surgical procedure and may
        also help in predicting the outcome. The purpose of the
        present study was to assess the pattern of cervical node
        metastasis from carcinoma of the oral tongue and to
        evaluate the impact of tumour status on survival.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and Methods
        A retrospective analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing
        primary surgical resection for squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma of
        oral tongue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between January 1997 and December 1998</TIMEX>, in a
        single surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, was carried out to evaluate the
        pattern of nodal metastasis and survival. The variables
        like age, sex, tumour size, grade, clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathological TNM</ENAMEX> and histopathological levels of
        involvement were extracted from case records. All the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> underwent evaluation under general anaesthesia
        before the surgery and clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> was modified if
        indicated. The types of surgical procedures performed are
        detailed in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. Adjuvant radiotherapy (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 Gy/15</NUMEX>
        fraction) was given if the primary tumour was greater than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cm, had close margins or nodal involvement was present or
        there was extranodal involvement. Minimum duration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follow-up</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> following surgery. Survival
        analysis was carried by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> method and the curves
        were compared using log rank test. Multivariate analysis
        was carried out using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazard model.
      
      
        Results
        Age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 to 75 years</TIMEX> with a
        mean age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52.6 years</TIMEX>. The male, female ratio was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had undergone primary surgical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resection</ENAMEX>.
        At presentation, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> tumour followed by T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinically</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were found to be neck node positive of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.7%</NUMEX>) were cN 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 , 6</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX>) were cN 
        2b and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7%</NUMEX>) were cN 
        2c . Histologically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> cases were found
        to have positive neck nodes, of which majority (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.3%</NUMEX>)
        were pN 
        2b . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> stage distribution is
        detailed in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. Cervical lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node metastasis</ENAMEX> was
        present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47.1%</NUMEX> of T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> tumours, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.13%</NUMEX> of T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> tumours, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.6%</NUMEX> of T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> tumours and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.1%</NUMEX> of T 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 tumours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Histologically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        cases were true positive for nodal metastasis while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        cases were true negative giving a sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.5%</NUMEX> and
        specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.9%</NUMEX> for clinical examination of the neck
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Synchronous discontinuous operations were
        performed in all cases. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a positive
        resection margin, however the margin was close (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-5 mm</ENAMEX>) in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cases. Neck was managed by vein preserving neck
        dissection in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>) and supraomohyoid neck
        dissection in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.3%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). It was observed
        that the nodal involvement in ipsilateral level <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> was
        highest (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.6%</NUMEX>), followed by the involvement of level I
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.5%</NUMEX>), level III (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.2%</NUMEX>) and level <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.2%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the distribution of nodes at different levels
        of the neck in varying combination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skip</ENAMEX> metastasis to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">level III / III</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cases. On
        histopathological examination, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had
        bilateral positive nodes. These nodes were located at level
        I bilaterally and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had undergone bilateral vein
        preserving neck dissection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received adjuvant radiotherapy, radiotherapy was
        given to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32/34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, or extranodal
        spread. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with T1N0 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        T2N0 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> each with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1N1</ENAMEX> and T2N1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy.
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two-year</TIMEX> follow-up, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cases failed, the
        failure was nodal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX>, primary in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8</TIMEX>, and both primary and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodal</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX>, pathological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> and
        level of positive node are illustrated in additional table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The overall disease free survival (DFS) was found to be
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78.4%</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 - year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68.4%</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 1</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> tumours were found to have a
        significantly poor survival, with the disease free survival
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2 - years</TIMEX> being <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36.6%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> tumours showed better prognosis with
        disease free survival of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76.2% and 83.5%</NUMEX> respectively at
        the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>) (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Histopathological node negative cases had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFS</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> at
        the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> whereas pathological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (pN 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) had survival of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.7%</NUMEX> and pN 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.5%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>) (figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). No other parameter including use of adjuvant
        radiotherapy was found to have significant effect on
        disease free survival. On multivariate analysis the tumour
        size and nodal metastasis were found to be significant
        independent prognostic factors. The hazard ratio for
        failure was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.72</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T3</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.84</NUMEX>
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T4</TIMEX> tumours. Similarly hazard ratio for failure in N0
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>, it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.9</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N1</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.9</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N2</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.2</NUMEX> in
        N3 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Sex was also found to be an independent
        prognostic factor with hazard ratio for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>
        however this difference was statistically not
        significant.
      
      
        Discussion
        Squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinoma</ENAMEX> arising in oral tongue is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curable</ENAMEX> if assessed and treated appropriately. Clinically
        undetectable nodal metastasis is the commonest cause of
        treatment failure. Incidence of neck metastasis in oral SCC
        is reported to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34% to 50%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In our series, level

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> was found to be the most commonly involved site (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.6%</NUMEX>)
        and level <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> involvement was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.2 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Isolated level <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> involvement in absence of involvement of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the higher levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>) was not documented
        in any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in the present study. Further, clinically
        node negative cases never showed level <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> involvement. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shah</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] had documented similar results. Hence, a
        supraomohyoid neck dissection is justified when the neck is
        clinically negative. On the contrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byers et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] , found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oral cancer</ENAMEX>, to have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastasis</ENAMEX> in level <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> without nodes in level <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>.
        It was seen that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 35.6%</NUMEX> of T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> lesions showed nodal metastasis where
        as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.3%</NUMEX> of the larger tumours showed metastasis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        Previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 6</NUMEX> ] support our finding that tumour
        size is a predictor of lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX> metastasis though they
        propose that tumour thickness is a more reliable factor.
        This is further explained by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiTroia</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , who
        points to difficulty for the tumour emboli to form in small
        calibre lymphatics of the superficial areas, compared with
        wider lymphatic of deeper tissues. However, tumour
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thickness</ENAMEX> is a radiological or histological parameter,
        which cannot be assessed preoperatively by clinical
        examination or biopsy.
        In our study, sensitivity and specificity of clinical
        examination was poor suggesting that clinical examination
        is of limited use in predicting cervical nodal metastasis.
        This is in accord with previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . One
        option would be to look for a more reliable methods to
        asses the neck. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sajeeda et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] documented that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultrasonography</ENAMEX> is not only useful in detecting neck nodes
        but is also useful in assessing the nodal characteristic
        and the degree of vascular invasion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takashima et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] demonstrated ultrasound guided fine needle
        aspiration to have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93.7%</NUMEX> diagnostic accuracy. Computed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomographic</ENAMEX> (CT) scanning too is very useful for the
        purpose of early detection of neck metastasis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the other hand has been
        found to have little advantage over clinical examination as
        the soft tissue contrast resolution reported by MRI is
        inadequate to detect minimal morphological changes in lymph
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        The technique of sentinel node biopsy is gaining
        popularity. Surgery on the primary tumour often modifies
        lymphatic drainage, so sentinel node biopsy is useful when
        primary tumour and neck are operated at the same time [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        ] . If the treatment decision has to be based on the
        present sensitivity and specificity of clinical
        examination, then a minimum selective neck dissection
        should be carried out for all node negative necks where
        primary is being treated by surgery as primary modality.
        Studies have documented that ipsilateral level <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX> and
        III neck dissection is an adequate diagnostic procedure for
        staging of the clinically node negative neck in early oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tongue cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Its diagnostic role cannot be
        replaced by preoperative radiological screening and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">intraoperative</ENAMEX> frozen section sampling.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and T 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 tumours</TIMEX> show a similar, significantly
        higher disease free survival compared to T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> tumours, even though the number in the
        present study is small the conclusions can be drawn with
        conviction from these results as shown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> studies
        on smaller sample size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
        too have shown similar results. Nodal metastases too
        significantly correlate with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> free survival as also
        documented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolgar et al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Similar results
        were seen in the present study as well, where tumour size,
        nodal status and surgery as primary modality were found to
        be a significant predictor of disease free survival.
        In the light of the present results showing a poor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity of clinical examination in
        predicting nodal metastasis and infrequent involvement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">level IV</ENAMEX> in the absence of involvement of higher levels, we
        suggest that a supraomohyoid neck dissection should be
        carried out in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of the oral tongue <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> with
        clinically node negative neck to achieve a better disease
        free survival.
