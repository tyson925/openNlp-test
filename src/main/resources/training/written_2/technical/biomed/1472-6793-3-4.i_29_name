        Chronically elevated cortisol levels caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cushing</ENAMEX>'s
        syndrome leads to central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] while the reduction
        of cortisol caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Addison</ENAMEX>'s disease leads to decreased
        body weight [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several rodent</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is
        also associated with elevated corticosterone levels, and
        adrenalectomy reverses some of the phenotypes associated
        with these forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore,
        elevated corticosterone production can cause a metabolic
        syndrome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These data suggest that reduction of
        glucocorticoid production might therefore constitute a
        plausible clinical strategy to treat obesity. On the other
        hand, obesity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> does not generally entail elevated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma cortisol</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] and it is not clear how
        effective reduction of glucocorticoid production would be
        to reverse obesity if glucocorticoid production were
        otherwise normal. Nevertheless, pharmacological antagonism
        of glucocorticoid (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mifepristone</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RU486</NUMEX>) was reported to reverse high fat diet-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Since diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> does not entail
        elevated glucocorticoid levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , this result
        suggests that reduction of glucocorticoid levels would
        reverse obesity even when glucocorticoid levels are not
        elevated.
        Although the mechanisms through which adrenalectomy acts
        to reverse obesity is not entirely clear, it is plausible
        that the mechanisms entail enhanced hypothalamic POMC
        production [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypothalamic POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA is reduced in
        several forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Conversely,
        reversal of obese phenotypes by adrenalectomy is associated
        with a restoration of hypothalamic POMC mRNA tone in
        leptin-deficient 
        ob/ob <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, the
        melanocortin agonist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTII</ENAMEX> (which mimics the key
        anti-obesity product of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX>, alpha-MSH) reduces body
        weight in diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand,
        the effect of diet-induced obesity on hypothalamic POMC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> is somewhat complex and may depend on the genetic
        background [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] , and duration of the diet [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ]
        or composition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] of the diet. Furthermore, the effect
        of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic POMC mRNA may also depend
        genetic background [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 26 27</ENAMEX> ] . Nevertheless, we
        hypothesized that if adrenalectomy enhanced hypothalamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA in diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, as in
        leptin-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, adrenalectomy would also reverse
        obese phenotypes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that became obese due to a
        high-fat diet. In the present study, we observed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> did indeed lead to a remarkable enhancement
        of hypothalamic POMC mRNA tone in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> made obese on a
        high-fat diet; surprisingly, however, adrenalectomy did not
        reverse diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Effects diet and adrenalectomy on body weight,
          adipose weight and caloric intake
          Prior to adrenalectomy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the high-fat diet
          gained body weight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX>-fold more rapidly than
          chow-fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first seven days</TIMEX> on the high-fat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> (chow fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.68</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX> g compared to
          high-fat <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diet mice</ENAMEX> which gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 g</NUMEX> over the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> on the diet; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>). At the end of
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five week</TIMEX> period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the high-fat diet, both
          sham-operated and adrenalectomized, exhibited a
          significant elevation of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) and
          adipose weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">chow</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sham-</ENAMEX>operated and adrenalectomized. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> initially caused a greater loss of body
          weight in the diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">obese mice</ENAMEX> (high fat-diet
          sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> g <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> after
          surgery compared to diet adrenalectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> who lost

          body weight in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had fully recovered body
          weight to pre-surgery levels. In the sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          mass of food intake was significantly decreased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          on the high fat diet compared to the chow-fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1C). Although the diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">obese mice</ENAMEX> consumed more
          (calculated) calories than chow-fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> during the first
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> on the diet (during which the most rapid weight gain
          was observed), by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth week</TIMEX> they were hypophagic
          both in terms of mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> consumed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/day</ENAMEX>) and in
          calculated calories consumed (calories/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) (the chow
          sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> consumed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.1</NUMEX> ± 0.8 [calculated]

          sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
          Surprisingly, adrenalectomy had no effect on body
          weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A), adipose weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) or food intake
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on either the chow diet or the high
          fat diet, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> after initiation of the diet and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> after adrenalectomy.
        
        
          Effects of diet and adrenalectomy on serum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerance</ENAMEX> and metabolic rate
          Serum leptin was elevated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the high-fat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, concordant with the development of obesity, but
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> had no effect on leptin levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>).
          Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin nor glucose</ENAMEX> was significantly influenced
          by either diet or adrenalectomy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). The high fat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX> had no effect on serum corticosterone, but as
          expected adrenalectomy reduced serum corticosterone by
          over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on both diets (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). While this
          effect was significant, consistent with previous studies
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , adrenalectomy did not eliminate detectable
          corticosterone completely.
          Glucose tolerance was strikingly impaired after only
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> on the high fat diet (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>).
          Adrenalectomy slightly but significantly improved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          tolerance on the high fat diet (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
          Total heat production (not normalized to body weight) was
          significantly elevated by the high fat diet (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A; p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) and adrenalectomy led to a slight but
          statistical further increase in heat production in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">obese mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fib</ENAMEX>. 3B; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.002</NUMEX>). VO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption normalized to
          body weight) was reduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the high fat diet
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) and as with total heat
          production adrenalectomy slightly but statistically
          increased VO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">obese mice</ENAMEX> group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Therefore adrenalectomy led to a
          slight but statistical increase in metabolic rate as well
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerance</ENAMEX> in the diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effects of diet and adrenalectomy on pituitary POMC
          mRNA
          Although diet did not influence pituitary POMC mRNA,
          adrenalectomy increased pituitary POMC expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both diets</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). Together with the reduction in
          serum corticosterone, this induction of pituitary POMC
          indicates that the adrenalectomy produced a
          physiologically significant reduction in corticosterone
          tone.
        
        
          Effects of diet and adrenalectomy on hypothalamic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA
          The high-fat diet led to a slight but significant
          increase in hypothalamic POMC mRNA in sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> produced a non-significant
          trend toward an increase in hypothalamic POMC mRNA in
          sham-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, but a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the high-fat diet (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A). The high-fat diet
          did not significantly influence hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> in this
          study, but surprisingly adrenalectomy slightly stimulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic AGPR</ENAMEX> mRNA levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The high fat diet used in this study led to the
        development of obesity over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> as
        expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). As observed in leptin-deficient 
        ob/ob <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, adrenalectomy in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">obese mice</ENAMEX> led to a striking increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A). This elevation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic POMC</ENAMEX> with only a very modest increase in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B) would be expected to lead to
        significant amelioration of obese phenotypes, consistent
        with effects of adrenalectomy on other forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obesity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Indeed adrenalectomy initially led to a greater
        loss of body weight after surgery in the diet-induced obese
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (results in text above). Surprisingly, however,
        adrenalectomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> regained all the weight lost after
        surgery (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A), and adrenalectomy also failed to reduce
        food intake, adipose weight, or plasma leptin in the obese
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        As has been observed in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of obesity due to a
        high-fat diet, the diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">obese mice</ENAMEX> also became
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypophagic</ENAMEX> compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">chow</ENAMEX> fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and compared to
        the hyperphagia exhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two weeks</TIMEX> on
        a high fat diet [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). The hypophagia of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> may be related to the modestly
        elevated hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX>, whose product alpha-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSH</ENAMEX> is a
        known anorexic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 29</NUMEX> ] . In turn, the induction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic POMC</ENAMEX> by the high-fat diet might have been due
        in part to the elevation of leptin in diet-induced obese
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). The further elevation in POMC expression
        observed after adrenalectomy of the obese <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> could
        plausibly be due to elevated leptin combined with decreased
        glucocorticoids, since glucocorticoids may antagonize the
        effects leptin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        Tolerance to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> load was also impaired in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> on the high-fat diet, suggesting the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However,
        neither basal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> nor serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels were
        elevated by the high fat diet at this time point (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>).
        We have observed in other studies that basal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperinsulinemia</ENAMEX> is not detected until <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have been on
        the high-fat diet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least two months</TIMEX> (unpublished
        observations). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> led to only minor improvement
        in impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and it did not
        affect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> or serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>).
        The key observation concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> intake was that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> did not significantly influence food intake
        on either diet. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> on the high-fat diet ate less than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the chow diet, both in terms of mass consumed and,
        surprisingly, in terms of total calculated caloric intake
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). Since caloric intake was calculated without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> to body weight, for purposes of analyzing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">metabolic</ENAMEX> economy the most valid comparison of total
        caloric intake is to total caloric expenditure (total heat
        production) without normalization to body weight, as shown
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Although the effect was small, the increase on
        the high-fat diet in total heat production without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> to body weight was significant (statistical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reliability</ENAMEX> derived in part from the many repeated
        measures, once every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hours</TIMEX>, that
        measuring metabolic rate entails). Similarly, the very
        small further increase in metabolic rate after
        adrenalectomy was significant. When metabolic rate was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to body weight, expressed as V02 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>),
        the effect of diet was to reduce this parameter, and
        adrenalectomy increased very slightly but significantly
        caused this measure of metabolic rate, normalized for body
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). The effect of diet on normalized
        metabolic rate may be construed as suggesting that the
        failure of metabolic rate to scale proportionally to the
        increase in body weight on the high fat diet may have
        contributed to the maintenance of the obese <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
        especially since the calculated caloric intake on the high
        fat diet was less than on the chow fat diet.
        The key conclusion to be drawn from the metabolic rate
        and food intake data is that effect of adrenalectomy on
        metabolic rate was marginal, and there was no effect of
        adrenalectomy on food intake, consistent with the lack of
        effect of adrenalectomy on other obese phenotypes.
        Nevertheless, with respect to the mechanism of diet-induced
        obesity, the present data seem to indicate that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">obese mice</ENAMEX> maintained their obesity despite
        apparently decreased caloric intake and increased caloric
        expenditure. Several explanations might account for this
        anomalous result. First, caloric intake is calculated from
        the caloric density as empirically measured and reported by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of the diets; it remains possible that
        due to differences in these measurements, the true
        metabolically available calories may differ from these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">empirically</ENAMEX> measured calories. If so, it remains possible
        that the high-fat diet may actually include relatively more
        metabolically available calories than the chow diet, and
        thus that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the high-fat diet in reality consumed
        more metabolically available calories than reflected by
        simple calculation of empirically determined caloric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>. It is also possible that calories were absorbed
        more efficiently on the high-fat diet. In any case, none of
        these considerations compromise the basic observation that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> failed to reverse diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX>.
        Since adrenalectomy only reduced plasma corticosterone
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX> in the obese <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, rather than completely
        eliminating the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> from circulation, it remains
        possible that even further reduction of corticosterone
        would produce an effect on diet-induced obese phenotypes.
        On the other hand, using the same adrenalectomy protocol
        that produced a similar reduction, but not elimination, of
        plasma corticosterone levels, we observed a remarkable
        reversal of obese phenotypes in leptin-deficient 
        ob/ob <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, the
        reduction of corticosterone by adrenalectomy in the present
        study was sufficient to produce elevation of pituitary POMC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> (as well as hypothalamic POMC mRNA), demonstrating
        that the reduced levels were clearly producing
        physiological effects. Consistent with these results, high
        fat diet attenuates the effect of adrenalectomy to reverse
        obese phenotypes in 
        ob/ob <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> led to significant increases in
        body weight and adiposity and to the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intolerance</ENAMEX>. Adrenalectomy reverses obese phenotypes
        including melanocortin tone in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> models of obesity in
        which plasma glucocorticoid levels are elevated. Consistent
        with results in ob/ob <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, adrenalectomy did stimulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamic POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA associated with marginal
        improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerance</ENAMEX> and metabolic rate in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> made obese by the high-fat diet. However, these
        responses to adrenalectomy failed to reduce food intake,
        body weight, adiposity, or leptin in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> made obese by the
        high-fat diet, in which the obsese <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> was not associated
        with elevated glucocorticoid levels. Thus neither
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomy</ENAMEX> nor remarkable enhancement of hypothalamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA produced significant attenuation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>-induced obese phenotype. In contrast to other models
        of obesity, however, diet-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> was not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with either elevated glucocorticoid levels or
        reduced hypothalamic POMC mRNA. These data raise the
        possibility that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-obesity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> based on
        reducing glucocorticoid tone or elevating melanocortin tone
        may have limited efficacy in treating forms of obesity in
        which those systems are not perturbed.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
          The appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Animal Review Board</ENAMEX> had
          approved all studies.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Male C57Bl/6J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were obtained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 months of age</TIMEX>
          from The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>, ME) and were
          individually housed with free access to feed and water
          under <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:12</TIMEX> h light-dark cycle (lights on at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">07:00 h</TIMEX>).
          This age was chosen because body weight is stable at this
          age, facilitating interpretation of the expected opposing
          effects of diet and adrenalectomy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57Bl/6J</ENAMEX> strain
          was chosen for susceptibility to obesity on a high fat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">diet</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were placed on either a high
          fat diet (diet <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D12492; Research Diets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX>, IN) for a total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> during
          which time both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> weight and food intake was monitored
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. Cages were changed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> and a sieve was used to
          measure spilt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. The high fat diet (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>)
          consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 kcal%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 kcal%</NUMEX> carbohydrate and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 kcal%</NUMEX> fat, while the standard rodent chow diet (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.08</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kcal/g</ENAMEX>) consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 kcal%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 kcal%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbohydrate</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 kcal%</NUMEX> fat. More specifically, the
          composition of the high fat diet was (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per kg</NUMEX>): casein, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mesh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 g</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-cystine (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 g</ENAMEX>), maltodextrin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">125 g</ENAMEX>),

          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), lard (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">245 g</ENAMEX>), mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), dicalcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), calcium carbonate (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), potassium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citrate</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), vitamin mix (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), choline bitartrate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 g</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FD&C Blue Dye</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>).
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> on their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diets</ENAMEX>, tolerance to
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> load was tested by injection of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 mg/g</ENAMEX> body weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX>) monitored for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after injection. Previous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerance
          test, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> was removed from the cages for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hours</TIMEX> from
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">09:00 to 14:00 hours</TIMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> on the high-fat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> from both chow and high-fat <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diets</ENAMEX> were either
          bilaterally adrenalectomized or sham-operated as
          previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were then given one
          injection of dexamethasone (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">45 mg/kg body weight i.p.</ENAMEX>) to
          facilitate recovery from the surgery. The drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
          was replaced with normal saline (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>) to compensate
          for the loss of mineralocorticoids. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks</TIMEX> after the
          surgery when all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had recovered body weight lost due
          to the stress from the surgery, another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerance
          test was performed, and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another week</TIMEX>, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were placed into metabolic cages in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> in a
          balanced design. Metabolic rate was monitored
          continuously by indirect calorimetry for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hours</TIMEX> as
          previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Food</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> were
          freely available in the metabolic cages. Briefly, air
          from each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> was sampled every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> and oxygen
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> concentrations from each sample were
          measured independently. From the change in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, VO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was calculated as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption
          per hour normalized to body weight (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/kg/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>). Heat
          production was then calculated using the following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">formula: Heat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cal/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>) = ((<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.33</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX> × (VCO 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /VO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> )) × VO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 ×</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Body</ENAMEX> weight) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">× 60</NUMEX>). Therefore,
          the parameter VO 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is normalized to body weight,
          whereas heat production is not normalized to body weight
          and so reflects total energy expenditure.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were sacrificed toward the end of the light
          period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of the day</TIMEX> in the metabolic cages
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 17:00 and 19:00 h</TIMEX>) by decapitation after a brief
          exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trunk blood</ENAMEX> was collected;
          we have verified in pilot studies that this method of
          sacrifice does not increase plasma corticosterone above
          levels observed without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> exposure. Brains
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis were quickly removed and the
          hypothalamus was dissected out, frozen on dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and
          stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-70°C until</TIMEX> use as described previously
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Makimura</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 #5346</TIMEX>; [<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mizuno, 1999 #5302</ENAMEX>]. In addition,
          the anterior lobe of the pituitary was also removed and
          frozen on dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-70°C until</TIMEX> use.
          Epididymal white adipose tissue was also removed, weighed
          and frozen on dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-70°C until</TIMEX> use. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> groups that resulted from this experimental design
          was as follows: chow sham-operated (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), chow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenalectomized</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>), diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sham</ENAMEX>-operated (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), and
          diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenalectomized</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). Successful adrenalectomy
          was verified by visual inspection at the time of
          sacrifice, as well as by the induction of pituitary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proopiomelanocortin</ENAMEX> (POMC) mRNA levels and the reduction
          in serum corticosterone levels.
        
        
          Blood chemistry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood glucose</ENAMEX> levels were measured by a Lifescan
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Touch II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose meter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson & Johnson</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mountain View</ENAMEX>, CA). Serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and leptin peptide
          levels were assayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> with commercial kits
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRYSTAL CHEM INC.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>) and serum corticosterone
          was assayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIA</ENAMEX> with a commercial kit (ICN
          Pharmaceuticals Inc., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Mesa</ENAMEX> Ca).
        
        
          Northern blot analysis
          Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and
          agouti-related peptide (AGRP) mRNA and pituitary POMC
          mRNA were measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis as
          previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Briefly, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          extracted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIzol</ENAMEX> (GIBCO BRL, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> micrograms of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from hypothalamus,
          estimated by spectrophotometer and verified by gel
          electrophoresis, was subjected to Northern blot analysis
          to measure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGRP</ENAMEX> mRNA. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> micrograms of total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior pituitary</ENAMEX> was used to measure pituitary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POMC</ENAMEX> mRNA. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was denatured in a mixture of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glyoxal</ENAMEX> and dimethyl sulfoxide for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50°C</TIMEX> and
          electrophoresed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM sodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> agarose gel. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was transferred to an
          Immobilon membrane over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 ×</TIMEX> standard saline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citrate</ENAMEX> (SSC) by capillary action. The membrane was
          subsequently baked for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80°C</TIMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV</ENAMEX> light at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">33000 uJ/cm 2energy.</ENAMEX> The
          membranes were prehybridized in a commercial Ultrahyb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buffer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 to 2 hours</TIMEX> at
          65°C. Hybridization was carried out in the same buffer
          with a single stranded internally labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> over
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX>. The membranes were washed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SSC/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.1%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature twice followed by
          two more washes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SSC/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.1%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> at
          room temperature. Finally, the membrane was washed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SSC/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.1%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX>, and exposed to a
          phosphoimager screen over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. The Northern blots were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probed</ENAMEX> using single-stranded internally labeled DNA
          probes as described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Membranes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-probed and hybridized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-labeled probe encoding
          18S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> and all signals were normalized to this
          18S signal upon quantification. The total integrated
          densities of hybridization signals were determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphoimager</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STORM 860</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>,
          CA).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Statistical analysis was performed by a two-way
          analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed, when indicated by
          appropriate p-values (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tukey-Kramer</ENAMEX>
          post-hoc test, using the JMP statistical package
          implemented on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> operating system. For the
          glucose tolerance tests and metabolic rate measurements,
          a two-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> (treatment × time) was performed using
          the JMP statistical package.
