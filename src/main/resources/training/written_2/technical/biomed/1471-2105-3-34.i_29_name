        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> transduction is the primary means by which cells
        coordinate their metabolic, morphologic, and genetic
        responses to environmental cues such as growth factors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormones</ENAMEX>, nutrients, osmolarity, and other chemical and
        tactile stimuli. Traditionally, the discovery of molecular
        components of signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and mammals has
        relied upon the use of gene knockouts and epistasis
        analysis. Although these methods have been highly effective
        in generating detailed descriptions of specific linear
        signaling pathways, our knowledge of complex signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and their interactions remains incomplete. New
        computational methods that capture molecular details from
        high-throughput genomic data in an automated fashion are
        desirable and can help direct the established techniques of
        molecular biology and genetics.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray technology has evolved to the point where
        one can simultaneously measure the transcript abundance of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of conditions, producing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of individual data points. Similarly,
        high-throughput yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid experiments have
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pairwise protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. Once a core pathway is established, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> can readily be integrated into model refinements, as a
        recent study in systems biology elegantly demonstrates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] . However, synthesizing these data 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> into models of pathways and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> remains a significant challenge.
        How can one bridge the gap from transcript abundances
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction data to pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>?
        Clustering expression data into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes that share
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX> is a proven method for grouping functionally
        related genes, but does not order pathway components
        according to physical or regulatory relationships. Here we
        present an automated approach for modelling signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae by integrating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] and gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Our program, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NetSearch</ENAMEX>, draws all possible linear
        paths of a specified length through the interaction map
        starting at any membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and ending on any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding protein</ENAMEX>. Microarray expression data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ]
        is then used to rank all paths according to the degree of
        similarity in the expression profiles of pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> pathways that have common starting points and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX> and the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranks</ENAMEX> are then combined into the
        final model of the branched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
        Our approach is calibrated using the yeast MAPK
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mitogen</NUMEX>-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>) pathways involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pheromone</ENAMEX> response, filamentous growth, and maintenance of
        cell wall integrity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These pathways are activated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> and characterized by a core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade of MAP</ENAMEX> kinases that activate each other through
        sequential binding and phosphorylation reactions; they are
        among the most thoroughly studied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and are
        therefore excellent benchmarks against which to test our
        approach.
      
      
        Results
        
          Input data and parameters
          Recent papers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] have used the yeast-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          technique and literature surveys to identify and assemble
          over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7000</TIMEX> non-redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions
          among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 4000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid screens
          efficiently identify fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are able to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interact</ENAMEX>, the biological significance of the interaction
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native proteins</ENAMEX> acting 
          in vivo generally requires
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verification</ENAMEX>, because the technique is susceptible to a
          high rate of false positives [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . To assess the
          possible contribution of false-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interactions to the combined interaction dataset, we
          analyzed the connectivity of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and found that
          a small fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> had a very high number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> (highlighted in red, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). With these
          highly connected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> included in our data set,
          NetSearch generates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> signaling
          pathways of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or less, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of which involve
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> highly-connected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We
          excluded the highly interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from the
          interaction dataset based on their nonspecific inclusion
          in the predicted pathways and evidence of their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to systematic error. This yielded an
          interaction map that contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5560</TIMEX> interactions among
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3725</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, an average of three interactions per
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetSearch</ENAMEX> algorithm, this protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> was queried for paths up to length
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> that begin at membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and end at
          transcription factors. The search generated approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> pathways of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or less
          whose biological plausibility was assessed using gene
          expression data.
          To score the pathways, we first used a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -means algorithm to cluster all
          yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into clusters based on their expression
          profiles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetSearch</ENAMEX> then assigned each pathway a
          statistical score [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] according to the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that clustered together. For example, a
          path with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in one cluster would score higher
          than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> that only had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in that cluster.
          Cluster size influenced path scoring such that a path
          that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> elements
          would score higher than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> members
          from a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. Also, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in one cluster and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in a second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> would score higher than a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, but no more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in
          cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
          Pathways were scored using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetSearch</ENAMEX>'s 'sumprob'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">scoring metric: Assuming N</ENAMEX> proteins total and a
          partitioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> into k clusters C 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , C 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ,...C 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ,...<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, respectively, and a pathway
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p of L</ENAMEX> proteins p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> â†’p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> â†’...â†’ p 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> , where c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (i) = number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> in
          cluster C 
          i , the sumprob score is computed as
          follows:
          
          prob 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (i) scores a pathway for a cluster C
          
          i such that pathways which are more
          concentrated in C 
          i have higher scores. The summation in
          prob 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (i) computes the cumulative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypergeometric</ENAMEX> probability of pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> containing c

          i . prob 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (i) assesses co-clustering of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the single cluster C 
          i . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sumprob</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>), the sum of prob 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (i) values over all clusters for
          which c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (i) >= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, is a simple measure of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-clustering across the entire collection of available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>. The rationale for the restriction c 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (i) >= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> is that without it a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> could get a high score simply from having single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> rare clusters, in which case the
          score would no longer reflect 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX> -clustering.
          The exact composition of paths discovered using
          NetSearch depend on the parameters used in path drawing
          and path scoring. To ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetSearch</ENAMEX> reproducibly
          generates statistically significant, biologically
          plausible paths, we combinatorially varied every
          parameter value in the path-drawing and path-scoring
          algorithms, and selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parameter</ENAMEX> combinations that
          generate the most statistically significant pathways.
          Statistical significance was measured by drawing pathways
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane proteins</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX> through
          the experimentally determined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-interaction map
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">henceforth</ENAMEX> called "real pathways") and comparing these
          pathways with pathways drawn through control interaction
          maps that were created by randomizing all pairwise
          interactions in the original dataset. (The randomization
          procedure was performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times and statistics were
          calculated on the average output of these runs. Paths
          produced using these interaction maps are henceforth
          referred to as "random pathways"). We ultimately chose
          parameters that maximized the number of high-scoring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> produced with real interactions, while
          minimizing high-scoring pathways from the randomized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>.
          The parameters we varied included the number of
          clusters into which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were grouped, the
          microarray expression datasets used in clustering, the
          maximum path length, and the scoring metric. Expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were clustered into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 25, 50, 100 and 250</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, and NetSearch best discriminated between real
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> and random pathways when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were grouped into
          25 clusters. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae expression datasets
          were examined individually, including the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Compendium</ENAMEX>"
          set, composed of expression profiles in response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
          diverse mutations and chemical treatments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ; the
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MAPK</ENAMEX>" set, composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> conditions chosen to probe the
          behavior of MAPK signal transduction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ; and the
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cell Cycle</ENAMEX>" set, composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> conditions relevant to
          the cell cycle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Combinations of these datasets
          were also examined, for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different sets
          that allowed us to compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of data that
          probes specific biological processes, such as MAPK
          signaling or the cell cycle, and that which probes the
          state of the cell more broadly, such as the Compendium
          set and the combined sets. The composite data set that
          combined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> sets (for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">433</NUMEX>
          conditions) provided the best discrimination between real
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> and random pathways, although the other sets
          performed comparably.
          The final input parameter that required evaluation was
          the maximum path length allowable for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NetSearch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>.
          While short path lengths risk omission of key path
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, longer path lengths increase the likelihood of
          including false-positive interactions. As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step
          towards determining the optimal maximum path length, we
          examined the path lengths connecting every possible pair
          of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3725</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the interaction dataset,
          regardless of subcellular localization. The minimal path
          length between any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> chosen at random contains
          on average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, we examined the
          fraction of pathways with high coclustering ratios for
          various path lengths. Consistent with our finding that
          the average path length between any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>,
          this fraction peaks at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>, which we set as our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maximum</ENAMEX>, unless otherwise noted.
        
        
          NetSearch output
          Using a maximum path length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> gene
          clusters from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">433</NUMEX> conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] , NetSearch
          generated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~4.4 million pathways</NUMEX> each for the real and
          randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> interaction datasets. From the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimental</ENAMEX> ("real") data, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4059</TIMEX> pathways had a
          coclustering score â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 16</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). At this cutoff,
          randomized interaction data produced on average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only ~1%</NUMEX>
          this number of pathways (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32 pathways</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>).
          However, we emphasize that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetSearch</ENAMEX> selects paths based
          on their rank relative to all paths between selected
          starting and endpoints. The absolute score depends on the
          particular expression data set used, and varies from
          network to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> depending on the degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coregulation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> under the conditions tested in
          the expression data.
          The signaling network models generated by NetSearch
          for the pheromone response, cell wall integrity and
          filamentation pathways are depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In each
          case, the starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, depicted in blue)
          and ending <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (transcription factor, depicted in
          red) were selected as inputs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NetSearch</ENAMEX> draws all
          possible paths between these points. The size of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertex</ENAMEX> is proportional to the sum of scores of the paths
          in which that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is found, providing a useful visual
          clue to the potential importance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the
          given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1shows that NetSearch
          reproduced many of the essential elements of these MAPK
          pathways, while providing a detailed account of the
          experimentally determined interconnections among network
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> generated
          for the pheromone response pathway originating at Ste3p
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A) exhibited the highest co-clustering scores.
          Every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein NetSearch</ENAMEX> included in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> model
          has a description in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeast Proteome Database</ENAMEX> (YPD) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] consistent with a known or plausible role in mating.
          Of the nineteen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> we have included in our
          depiction of the pheromone response network, eighteen are
          annotated as playing a role in the fungal cell
          differentiation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The probability that
          this selection would have occurred by chance was
          calculated with the hypergeometric distribution was found
          to be P = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -24</NUMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> does differ in several
          respects from the canonical pheromone response pathway
          depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 1</ENAMEX>. It includes more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterotrimeric G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, including the alpha,
          beta, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma subunits</ENAMEX>, the GDP-GTP exchange factor,
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTPase-activating protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gpa1p, Ste4p, Ste18p,</ENAMEX>
          Cdc24p, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sst2p</ENAMEX>, respectively). It includes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Far1p</TIMEX>, a
          protein necessary for pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest
          in G1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mpt5p</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> necessary for recovery
          from cell cycle arrest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bem1p and Sph1</TIMEX>, both
          of which are necessary for establishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> polarity
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">shmooing</TIMEX> and budding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . In our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-interaction map there is no direct interaction
          between a pheromone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ste2p</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ste3p</NUMEX>) and any
          component of the heterotrimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein complex
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ste4p/Ste18p/Gpa1p</ENAMEX>), so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NetSearch</ENAMEX> drew indirect paths
          through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Akr1p</TIMEX>, a known inhibitor of signaling in the
          pheromone pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> does not
          include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42p</ENAMEX> (paths were instead drawn
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> through its cofactor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc24p</TIMEX>, which
          physically interacts with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ste4p</NUMEX>) or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste20p</TIMEX>, because of
          missing interactions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-interaction map.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Bdepicts the pheromone response network at
          several different score cutoffs, and demonstrates how
          higher co-clustering score cutoffs reduces the complexity
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-interaction map. NetSearch detects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">354</NUMEX>
          paths of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste3p</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste12p</TIMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporates</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> into those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX>. The
          top graph in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Bshows the network constructed from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 354</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> (with each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> arranged on the
          perimeter of an ellipse for clarity). In the middle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">graph</ENAMEX>, all paths that scored below the median have been
          eliminated, leaving only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. On the bottom of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B, only the highest scoring paths (those used to
          construct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, are
          depicted. Comparison of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> indicates that
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are eliminated by simply excluding the
          pathways that score in the bottom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>; further
          modifications to the cutoff affect the results
          incrementally. In setting a precise cutoff for pathway
          inclusion in the final network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, one seeks to
          strike a balance between the inclusion of false-positives
          and the omission of true-positives. We set the cutoff
          such that the top <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fifteen paths</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> were
          included.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> model generated for the cell wall
          integrity pathway is depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C. Membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in particular may fail to produce interactions
          when forced into the nucleus by the requirements of the
          standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid technique. We observed this to be the
          case for the cell wall integrity pathway, as neither
          Wsc1p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wsc2p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wcs3p</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mid2p</TIMEX> were observed to interact in
          any of the high-throughput screens. To reconstruct this
          network, we therefore started with the momomeric GTPase
          Rho1p, and restricted our search to a length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          because of the omission of the initial signal sensor. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> included in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> model, all but
          Smd3p have descriptions consistent with a role in cell
          wall maintenance. NetSearch included both GTPase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of this pathway, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rho1p and Cdc42p</TIMEX>, as well
          as associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPs</ENAMEX> and other interactors, including
          Rdi1p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rga1p</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gic2p</TIMEX>. Other included network elements
          are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fks1p</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,3</NUMEX>-Î²glucan synthase of which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rho1p</TIMEX> is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , the actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Act1p</ENAMEX>, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins Bni1p</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bud6p</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sph1p</ENAMEX>, which are associated
          with Rho-mediated signal transduction, actin filament
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, cell polarity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>, and bud
          growth. Smd3p forms a complex with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sm</ENAMEX> core
          spliceosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and we are not aware of
          any role it may play in maintaining cell wall integrity.
          Its inclusion is most likely a result of its expression
          correlation with 
          BUD6 in one of the microarray
          datasets, but it seems unlikely that the observed
          interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smd3p with Spa2p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Slt2p</ENAMEX> have
          biological significance. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NetSearch</ENAMEX>-generated
          model, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bck1p</ENAMEX> is downstream of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mkk1p</TIMEX> because, although it
          interacts with both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mkk1p and Mkk2p</TIMEX>, it has been shown
          specifically not to interact with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Pkc1p</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> model for filamentous growth (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D)
          involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of which are known to play a
          role in filamentous growth, or have functions consistent
          with that role, with the exception of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fus1p</TIMEX>. As in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pheromone</ENAMEX> response and cell wall integrity network
          models, key components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras GTPase</ENAMEX> are included,
          such as Cdc25p (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras</ENAMEX> guanine nucleotide exchange
          factor), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cyr1p</TIMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ras</ENAMEX>-associated adenylate cyclase),
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Srv2p</ENAMEX>, which enables the activation of adenylate
          cyclase by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ras2p</TIMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with roles in actin
          filament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, cell polarity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>, bud
          growth, and GTPase-mediated signal transduction are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> with the cell wall integrity pathway, including
          Bni1p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spa2p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bud6p</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Act1p</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NetSearch</ENAMEX> depicts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">interactions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between Abp1p</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both Srv2p and Act1p</TIMEX>,
          consistent with the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Abp1</ENAMEX> in tethering Srv2p
          to the cytoskeleton. The adenylate cyclase and associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> mentioned above, along with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp82p and Hsc82p</TIMEX>,
          activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , a pathway that acts in
          parallel with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway to promote filamentation.
          Hsp82p is a chaperone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> known to interact with a
          number of signaling pathway components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . It is
          required for activation of the pheromone signaling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , and for the general response to amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid starvation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . It may play a similar role in
          response to nitrogen (ammonia) starvation, a trigger for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filamentation</ENAMEX>. Fus1p, included in our predicted network,
          does not have a documented role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">filamentation</TIMEX>; it is
          required for cell fusion during pheromone initiated
          mating. Its transcript levels are significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upregulated</ENAMEX> in response to pheromone, but are unchanged
          in 
          tec1Î” strains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ; that study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">notes</ENAMEX>, however, that in 
          dig1Î” <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dig2Î”</NUMEX> cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">fus1</ENAMEX> is
          constitutively activated, and both mating and invasive
          growth are observed. Tec1p, conspicuously absent in our
          model, has not been observed to interact with any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in high-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">throughput two</NUMEX>-hybrid screens.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The utility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction maps
        for generating signaling network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> has previously been
        suggested [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , and they have been used to predict
        metabolic pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Expression data has been used
        to generate and refine models for genetic regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> without the benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . In this study, we have used expression data
        to rank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interacting proteins</ENAMEX>. This
        approach has a strong biological and experimental
        rationale: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> used in the same signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> must
        exist simultaneously with its activation. The genes
        encoding these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> must be transcribed at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same time</TIMEX>, and under the same
        environmental conditions in which the signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is
        required. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that
        when a signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is activated, positive feedback
        mechanisms upregulate the expression of genes that encode
        pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , implying that this rationale is
        also applicable to "surveillance" pathways, whose protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> may need to be constitutively present in small
        quantities, but whose concentration increases with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. This biological rationale is borne out by
        evidence that interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have more highly
        correlated expression profiles than do non-interacting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . However, if a single component of a
        signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is independently (and differentially)
        regulated, it would not necessarily be excluded using our
        approach, if for instance, it connected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX> of a
        pathway which had similar average expression profiles.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetSearch</ENAMEX> can be used to predict new signaling pathways,
        identify previously unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of documented pathways,
        or identify smaller clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interacting proteins</ENAMEX>. Until
        we have a more complete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-interaction set, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> who
        wishes to explore a particular pathway
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://arep.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">med</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harvard</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu/NetSearchneeds</ENAMEX> to specify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> starting points and ending points (such as membrane
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX>, respectively). This selection can
        be based on a known genetic interaction, a shared mutant
        phenotype, a shared functional classification, or signature
        expression profile. This is the approach we have followed
        in constructing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are comprised of all highest ranking linear paths
        connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and transcription factors for that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>.
        The pheromone response pathway is commonly depicted as a
        simple, linear transmission of the mating signal from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane</ENAMEX> receptor, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste2p</TIMEX> (for alpha-factor) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ste3p</NUMEX> (for
        a-factor), to the nuclear effectors, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste12p and Mcm1p</TIMEX>, via
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> cascade. However, mating pheromone exposure also
        induces other cellular processes such as those required for
        polarized growth, cell cycle arrest, and recovery from cell
        cycle arrest. Furthermore, the topology of the protein
        interactions required for these processes is considerably
        more complicated than a series of pairwise interactions. In
        addition to accurately depicting the MAPK cascade, our
        predicted pheromone response network identifies many
        proteins necessary to execute the coordinated processes of
        growth polarization and cell cycle arrest, and reflects the
        complex topology of the interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
        The complexity of these interactions are observed in
        large, multifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of possibly dynamic
        composition. For example, products of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste18</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX>,
        Cdc24, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Far1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bem1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste20</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ste5</TIMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        thought to constitute a complex that has numerous
        interactions among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>, and that mediates many
        different cellular processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 28</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may
        coordinate mating pheromone detection with (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) cell cycle
        arrest via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Far1p</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) MAPK signal transduction via Ste5p
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ste20p</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) cell polarity via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bem1p</ENAMEX> and Far1p
        (among others) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        Given that several of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> share components of
        the MAPK cascade, the mechanism by which input-output
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> is maintained remains one of the most important
        questions in the field of molecular signal transduction.
        One well accepted hypothesis is that scaffolding proteins
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ste5p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pbs2p</ENAMEX> tether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> module to the
        appropriate input and output components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The recent
        identification of numerous Ste5p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analogs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> makes this hypothesis even more intriguing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scaffolding proteins</ENAMEX>, higher-order <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> complexes
        have been hypothesized to play a role in maintaining signal
        specificity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Our computational results suggest that
        this may indeed be the case. When comparing the minimal
        pathways for pheromone response and filamentation as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depicted in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, it appears that maintaining signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> would be a considerable challenge. But when
        comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> network predictions depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> notes many differences, all of which may help ensure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> perspective suggests not a single
        scaffolding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, but many scaffolding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> - in
        fact, a "scaffolding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>." The possibility exists that
        relatively nonspecific kinases function simply as
        "phosphorylation modules," operating inside insulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that are the primary determinant of signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>.
        Because our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction data is only a
        small fraction of a truly complete interaction map, one
        finds portions of a network that cannot be connected using
        available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction data. This was the
        case in our attempts to model the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. While
        NetSearch correctly identified the upstream elements of
        this pathway (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sln1p â†’ Ypd1p â†’ Ssk1p â†’ Ssk22p</ENAMEX>), it was
        unable to form any connections to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pbs2p</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hog1p</TIMEX> that ended
        in a transcription factor. In some cases, a missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> can be circumvented, however. In the model for
        the pheromone response network, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NetSearch</ENAMEX> inserted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Akr1p</TIMEX>, a
        known inhibitor of the pheromone pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , between
        Ste3p and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ste4p/Ste18p/Gpa1p</ENAMEX>).
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-interaction dataset we used contained
        no direct interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ste2p/Ste3p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ste4p</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ste2p-Ste4p</ENAMEX> has been shown to interact in a targeted yeast
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        Our failure to model the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">HOG pathway</ENAMEX> underscores the
        fact that, for the purposes of this algorithm, missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> (false-negatives) are a more significant
        obstacle than are false-positive interactions. Missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> cannot be "created" by the algorithm, but
        false-positive interactions are de-emphasized as a result
        of the bias imposed by ranking paths according to the
        similarity of expression profiles. Bearing this out, of the
        fifty-eight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> included in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, only Smd3p
        seems to be included as a result of false-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. (This is distinct from the case of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fus1p</TIMEX>,
        which may be misplaced in the filamentation pathway, but
        whose interactions with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Act1p and Ste7p</TIMEX> are real.) This
        highlights a general observation on the integration of
        genomic technologies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-hybrid and microarray expression
        studies are both known to have a sizable fraction of
        systematic errors (for instance, self-activators in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid experiments, and cross-hybridization in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX>), but when looking at the intersection of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, the true signals tend to reinforce one another,
        whereas the systematic errors in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tend to be
        different and are reduced further into the noise. These
        effects may help explain why we observe so few
        false-positive proteins inserted into our predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to using more complete interaction datasets,
        such as those found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ho</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gavin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , one
        could improve this approach by integrating more types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Homology modelling could be used to differentially
        weight the inclusion of molecules likely to be involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction (e.g. kinases), and genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> could weight the inclusion of the two proteins
        in the same path. Signaling motif identification [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase chips</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] could also easily be
        incorporated into this framework. Based on the interaction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> available, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4are static,
        with all interactions given equal weight, and without
        information on the direction of information transfer. In
        reality, signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are dynamic and vectorial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, with interactions of varying strengths among
        component <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The technology necessary to
        generate data which will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modelling</ENAMEX> of these network
        properties are beginning to emerge. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinase</ENAMEX> chips [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
        will allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to incorporate information about the
        direction of information flow. The strength of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> (with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>) has been measured on chips in a
        highly parallel manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] and the same could be done
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> and temporal co-localization of signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> is being generated by new imaging techniques [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> ] , which will yield <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insight</ENAMEX> into the mechanism with
        which the cellular response to a signal is modulated by the
        intensity and the duration of the signal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , and the
        interplay with parallel pathways.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The approach we have presented allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to query the
        intersection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enormous sets of functional
        genomic-derived molecular data. One can, in effect,
        simultaneously browse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction</ENAMEX> and gene
        expression data. It allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to extract a group of
        highly-connected, highly-correlated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from global
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to isolate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-network</ENAMEX> of particular interest.
        Significantly, this approach does not require prior
        knowledge of pathway intermediates. The interaction data
        determines the pathways that are considered, and gene
        expression data is used to rank the pathways. Although we
        have focused on signaling pathways, this approach should be
        applicable to modelling the relationships among any group
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interacting proteins</ENAMEX> that cooperate to perform a given
        function within a cell, and the web-version of the software
        allows for these queries. As many genomic techniques are
        generating increasingly large amounts of molecular data,
        new tools such as this will be required for the synthesis
        of "parts into pathways" in order that we may understand
        how cells regulate the many processes necessary for growth
        and development.
