        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I
        is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> example of type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase
        (for reviews, see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">refs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] ). Its major biological role
        in the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is the removal of excessive negative
        supercoils from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at optimal
        superhelical density along with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA gyrase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> has a molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> kDa and the active site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine</ENAMEX> responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA cleavage</ENAMEX> is found in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa N</ENAMEX>-terminal transesterification domain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 67</TIMEX> kDa domain has been determined by X-ray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystallography</ENAMEX> to be torus-like, indicating the need for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> conformational change for strand passage to take
        place after <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA cleavage</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Relaxation activity
        requires the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding tetracysteine
        motifs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] found between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Top67</NUMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal single-stranded DNA
        binding domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tetracysteine motifs
        do not form a stably folded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> on its own, but when
        combined with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain, forms a stably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">folded 268</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid DNA</ENAMEX> binding domain (ZD domain) that
        has higher affinity for single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 kDa</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region by itself [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Recent sequence and structural analysis suggests that the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> kDa domain is evolutionarily related to the three
        tetracysteine motifs and belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> ribbon family
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The ZD domain in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I probably
        evolved from a domain that binds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
        originally.
        Removal of negative supercoils from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by bacterial
        type IA topoisomerase involves the following steps: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        binding of the enzyme to the junction of double-stranded
        and single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) cleavage of a
        single-strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> near the junction with cleavage
        sequence preference of a cytosine in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> position to
        form the covalent intermediate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] ; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
        conformational change of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex to
        result in physical separation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' phosphate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covalently</ENAMEX> linked to the active tyrosine, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        hydroxyl of the cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) passage of the
        complementary single strand through the break; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) enzyme
        conformational change to bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' phosphoryl end back
        into the proximity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the cleaved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) religation of the phosphodiester bond. Although it
        is known that the ZD domain can function as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, its exact role in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> steps of removal
        of a negative superhelical turn from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I remains to be
        defined. Using purified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> kDa transesterification domain
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> kDa ZD domain, results from experiments described
        here provide new insight into the action of these two
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> in the enzyme mechanism.
      
      
        Results
        
          Partial restoration of relaxation activity from
          mixing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Top67</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZD</ENAMEX> domains
          As reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          transesterification domain Top67 by itself did not
          exhibit any relaxation activity when assayed with
          negatively supercoiled plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> kD
          C-terminal ZD domain also had no relaxation activity by
          itself, as expected. Partial relaxation of the input
          supercoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was detected when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Top67</ENAMEX> was mixed with
          the ZD domain prior to addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. A ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ZD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX> added for each Top67 was found to be sufficient
          for maximum relaxation activity, with no increase in
          activity when higher ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ZD/Top67</ENAMEX> was used (data not
          shown). The specific activity observed under this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">optimized condition</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>) was still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> fold
          lower than that of the intact enzyme. Analysis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course of relaxation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> pmoles of topoisomerase
          I or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">top67</NUMEX> reconstituted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZD</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>) showed that
          negative supercoils were removed at a much slower rate by
          the reconstituted activity.
        
        
          Top67 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> have comparable binding
          affinities to single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> but significantly
          different affinities for double-stranded DNA
          The gel mobility shift assay was used to compare the
          binding affinities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Top67</ENAMEX> and the ZD domain to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
          end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> in
          length. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> had
          similar affinities for binding to the single-stranded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> maximal binding values based on the
          average of results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different experiments were
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.02 Î</NUMEX>¼M for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.04 Î</NUMEX>¼M for the ZD domain. However,
          with the same oligonucleotide in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> form (Figure
          3b), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> exhibited much higher affinity (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> maximal
          binding value = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.07 Î¼M</NUMEX>) than the ZD domain (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> maximal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">binding value > 5 Î¼M</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Top67 can recognize cleavage sites preferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX>
          coliDNA topoisomerase I
          Previous studies have shown that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I
          cleavage of single-stranded DNA occurs with selectivity
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with the C nucleotide base at the - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> position
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] and that the enzyme preferentially cleaves at
          junctions of double-stranded and single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          ] . Several different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>'-end labeled substrates were
          prepared and used in cleavage assays to compare the
          cleavage sites selected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> versus topoisomerase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>
          The results showed that with single-stranded substrates,
          Top67 also preferred cleavage sites with a C nucleotide
          base at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> position as reported for most of the type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">topoisomerases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . There were some differences
          from topoisomerase I in the relative distribution of
          cleavage products among the potential cleavage sites
          (Figure 4a,4b). Top67 appeared to be more
          non-discriminatory in selection of the possible cleavage
          sites with the C nucleotide in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> position. Addition
          of the ZD domain had no effect on the cleavage
          selectivity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX>. A substrate with both
          single-stranded and double-stranded regions was
          constructed to mimic such junction in negatively
          supercoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Top67 and topoisomerase I recognised the
          same cleavage site on this substrate (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>). Maximal
          yield of cleavage products was obtained for both Top67
          and topoisomerase I within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> after mixing of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> so any potential difference in cleavage
          rates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the Top67</TIMEX> and topoisomerase I is unlikely
          to account for the difference in relaxation
          efficiency.
        
        
          Top67 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cleavage sites</ENAMEX> are religated upon addition of
          high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+
          To test the religation capability of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-end
          labeled oligonucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> in length was first
          incubated with the enzyme in low ionic strength buffer to
          allow formation of the cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Sodium chloride
          concentration was then increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> to induce
          reversal of cleavage and dissociation of the enzyme from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. We observed that more complete and consistent
          reversal of cleavage was obtained with both topoisomerase
          I and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> if a low concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 mM</NUMEX>) was
          also added with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with an
          early observation of dissociation of the enzyme-DNA
          complex in high salt upon addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It
          has also been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] that addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was
          apparently not required for observation of this reversal
          of cleavage. However, it is possible that some enzyme
          preparations may contain bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and the low
          concentration of bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+might have been sufficient
          for reversal of cleavage, as postulated previously to
          explain the data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The results of this cleavage
          reversal experiment (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) indicated that the ZD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> was not required for efficient reversal of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Top67</ENAMEX> could carry out religation of cleaved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Again the reversal of cleavage was complete for both
          Top67 and topoisomerase I within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> after the
          addition of high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+even when the reactions
          were carried out on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> (data not shown) so the lack of
          relaxation activity by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> is unlikely to be due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> in religation.
        
        
          The ZD domain is not required for catenation of
          double-stranded DNA circles
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I can
          catalyze catenation of double-stranded DNA circles if the
          molecules contain single-strand scissions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . To
          test if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Top67</ENAMEX> can carry out double-stranded DNA
          passage at enzyme cleavage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> across from the DNA
          nicks, the yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA catenanes</ENAMEX> were compared with that
          obtained with topoisomerase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> In contrast to the
          relaxation activity, the catenating activity of Top67
          shown in figure 6was as efficient as that of full-length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topoisomerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, and the addition of the ZD domain had no
          effect (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>). The rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">catenane</ENAMEX> formation for
          Top67 alone was similar to that of topoisomerase I
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>). This catenation activity observed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">topoisomerase I and</ENAMEX> Top67 was unlikely to be due to
          contaminating topoisomerase III activity since it was not
          observed with the ZD domain purified under almost
          identical procedures and a site-directed mutant with
          substitution of the active site Tyr319 by phenylalanine
          also did not exhibit this activity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> homologous type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> topoisomerases present
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Topoisomerase III</ENAMEX> has
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potent DNA</ENAMEX> decatenating activity for resolution of plasmid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication intermediates</ENAMEX>, but much weaker relaxation
        activity than topoisomerase I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . To exhibit maximal
        relaxation activity, topoisomerase III requires high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">52Â°C</NUMEX>) along with low magnesium and monovalent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ion</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . In contrast, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I was not
        active in the 
        in vitro assay for resolution of
        plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication intermediates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Removal of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">653</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">topoisomerase III</ENAMEX> protein resulted in drastic reduction of
        catalytic activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Fusion of the carboxyl-terminal
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">312</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I, which
        includes the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZD</ENAMEX> domain, onto the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">605</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of topoisomerase III generated a hybrid
        topoisomerase that has relaxation activity resembling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">topoisomerase III</ENAMEX> along with weak decatenating activity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . Although preferring single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as binding
        substrate, topoisomerase I had been shown to also bind
        double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , but there is no data available
        to indicate which domain in the enzyme is responsible for
        this interaction.
        The experiments described here measured directly the
        interaction of the ZD domain with both double-stranded and
        single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrates</ENAMEX>. ZD domain was found to bind
        to single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, but not double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, with
        high affinity. This result indicated that with regard to
        the mechanism of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I, the ZD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> was likely to function as a single-stranded DNA
        binding domain instead of having double-stranded DNA
        binding function as previously suggested [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Even
        though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding transcription factors that recognise
        specific double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are well represented in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] , there are also numerous examples of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) coordination being required for interaction with
        single-stranded nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> or damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with
        single-strand characteristics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        The effect of removal of the ZD domain on the individual
        step of enzyme action was also investigated using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Top67</ENAMEX>.
        The results indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Top67</ENAMEX> was effective in binding
        to both double-stranded and single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. As a
        result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Top67</ENAMEX> could position itself in the absence of ZD
        domain at the junction of double- and single-stranded DNA
        for subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA cleavage</ENAMEX>, as previously observed for
        intact topoisomerase I [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Reversal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cleavage
        also took place readily with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> upon addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . The ZD domain also was not required
        for selectivity of a cytosine in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> position relative
        to the cleavage sites.
        Despite its ability to recognise the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrate</ENAMEX> and
        carry out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cleavage-religation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> by itself cannot
        catalyze change of linking number in the relaxation of
        supercoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The single-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> substrate designated
        for the ZD domain in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme
        may be the strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> complementary to the strand first
        cleaved by the enzyme to form the covalent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. This
        interaction with the passing strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> would not be
        needed for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps of enzyme mechanism up to
        the formation of the covalent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Our results showed
        that adding the purified ZD domain partially restored the
        relaxation activity. Therefore the ZD domain can supply the
        function that is missing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> even when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains
        are not covalently linked. However, the resulting
        relaxation activity is much less efficient than that of the
        intact enzyme, suggesting that coordinated actions of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> are required for efficient removal of negative
        supercoils from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The requirement of specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> could
        also account for the weak relaxation activity observed for
        the hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">topoisomerase</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZD</ENAMEX> linked to topoisomerase
        III sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        This proposed role for the ZD domain in interacting with
        the passing single-strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is also supported by the
        observation that there is no difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> and
        intact topoisomerase I in the formation of catenanes. This
        reaction involves passage of another double-stranded DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>, instead of the complementary DNA strand through the
        break generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cleavage so the ZD domain would not
        be expected to play any significant role. High
        concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrate</ENAMEX> is required to favor
        formation of catenanes catalyzed by topoisomerase I, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> also has to be present in higher concentration
        compared to the relaxation reaction. The double-stranded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding activity in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli topoisomerase</ENAMEX> III required
        for highly efficient decatenation activity is attributed to
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residue</ENAMEX> with no counterpart in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] .
        It may be required for interaction with the passing
        double-strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the decatenation mechanism. The
        presence of this decatenation loop instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binding ZD</ENAMEX> domain in topoisomerase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> may account for the
        dominance of the decatenation activity over the relaxation
        activity.
        Based on these results, we propose a model for the
        relaxation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supercoiled DNA</ENAMEX> by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)
        modified from previous versions that have a number of
        common features but differ most significantly in the role
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding domain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 21 29 30</NUMEX> ] . In this
        model, the subdomains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> is responsible for
        interacting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> both upstream and
        downstream of the cleavage site. The ZD domain interacts
        with the passing single-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to be transported
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-strand</ENAMEX>). After cleavage of the DNA gate strand which
        becomes covalently linked to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Tyr319</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX> (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> conformational change involving both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Top67</ENAMEX> and the
        ZD domain increases the distance between the covalently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bound 5</ENAMEX>' phosphate and non-covalently bound <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' hydroxyl of
        the cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> gate strand while the passing DNA strand
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-strand</ENAMEX>) is guided through the "gate" via interaction
        with the ZD domain (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) to lead to change in linking
        number. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> enzyme conformational change positions the
        cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ends for religation (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The ZD domain can
        still interact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> even when not
        linked to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Top67</NUMEX> in the same polypeptide, but efficiency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX> is reduced as a result, probably due to loss of
        coordinated action by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains. The presence of the
        ZD domain may enhance the transition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Top67</NUMEX> from a closed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> to a more open conformation so that strand
        passage can take place through the "DNA gate". Previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> showed that although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding is not absolutely
        required for formation of the cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, it increased
        the amount of cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that can be isolated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        When linked to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Top67</TIMEX>, the ZD domain also has some influence
        on the cleavage site selections. It has previously been
        observed that a mutation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding motif can
        affect the cleavage site selectivity of topoisomerase I [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] even though Top67 by itself can recognize both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosine</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> position and the junction of single- and
        double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. To gain further details for this model
        of enzyme action, we are characterizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        interactions between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Top67</NUMEX> transesterification domain
        and the ZD domain, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> conformational
        changes that can take place when the enzyme interacts with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrate</ENAMEX>.
        The hyperthermophilic topoisomerase I from 
        Thermotoga maritima has been shown to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinate one Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) with a unique tetracysteine motif
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Cys-X-Cys-X</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">16 -Cys-X-Cys</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding is not
        required for relaxation activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The sequence of
        this unique tetracysteine motifs is somewhat different from
        those present in other type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> topoisomerases in that the
        other tetracysteine motifs always had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> amino
        acids separating the pairs of cysteines (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Cys-X</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2-11</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cys</ENAMEX>), instead of just one amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Cys-X-Cys</ENAMEX>) in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima topoisomerase I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        Therefore the structure and function of the single <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
        binding motif in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima may differ from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multiple Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding motifs in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Direct</ENAMEX>
        interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. maritima Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding motif has
        not been demonstrated. It has been suggested that the
        mechanisms of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> may be different [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        Direct interaction between the enzyme and the passing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> may not be necessary for the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima topoisomerase I activity.
        The relaxation and decatenation activities of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima topoisomerase I appear to
        be significantly more efficient than those of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        Based on their primary sequences, a number of bacterial
        topoisomerase I enzymes do not appear to coordinate any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) with tetracysteines motifs while other type IA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topoisomerase</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 4</NUMEX> tetracysteine motifs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topoisomerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> from 
        Mycobacterium smegmatis has been
        demonstrated biochemically not to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . In
        contrast, mutation disrupting the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) motif of 
        Helicobacter pylori topoisomerase I
        abolished enzyme function 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Therefore there may
        be significant differences in the mechanisms of type IA
        topoisomerases from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> with respect to
        requirement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding for relaxation activity.
        There is also another possible explanation for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">varied</ENAMEX> number of tetracysteine motifs and requirement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) for relaxation activity found in different type IA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topoisomerases</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I has been
        classified based on its structure to be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>-ribbon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> release <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.50</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>] even though it does not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bind Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>). It also has high affinity for binding to
        single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> on its own when separated from the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tetracysteine motifs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Based on the structural
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding properties of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> topoisomerase <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I 14</ENAMEX> kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, one can conclude that it is possible for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subdomain</ENAMEX> in topoisomerase I to lose the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteines</ENAMEX> during evolution and still maintains the
        Zn-ribbon structure and single-strand DNA binding
        properties [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Finally, the 
        in vivo catalytic activities of
        eukarytotic type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IA</ENAMEX> topoisomerases, the topoisomerase III
        from various higher organisms may be related to their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The transesterification domains of these
        eukaryotic enzymes have high degrees of identity to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase III [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 37</NUMEX>
        ] . However, the decatenation loop is not present in the
        eukaryotic topoisomerase III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> and to date the
        decatenation activity has not been demonstrated for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX>. The number of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) binding cysteine
        motifs range from none in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase III
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> highly conserved tetracysteine motifs in the beta
        family of the topoisomerase III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>)
        domain formed by these tetracysteine motifs may be required
        for interaction with single-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in removal of
        hypernegative supercoils [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] or disruption of early
        recombination intermediates between inappropriately paired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> molecules [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that the ZD domain of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I is not
        required for the substrate recognition and DNA
        cleavage-religation action of the enzyme. We propose that
        the ZD domain interacts with the passing single-strand of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>.

          ZD domain were expressed and purified as described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 41</NUMEX>

          employing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chameleon-Mutagenesis</ENAMEX> kit from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stratagene</ENAMEX>.
          Top67 was expressed and purified with the same procedures

          The oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genosys</ENAMEX>. The single-strand substrates and the top strand
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex substrates</ENAMEX> were labeled at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' termini
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4</ENAMEX> polynucleotide kinase and Î³ 32P-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. The labeled
          oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>

          column.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> or heteroduplex substrates were prepared by

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> mM Tris-borate pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 mM EDTA</TIMEX>. Electrophoresis was
          carried out at room temperature at 2 V/cm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> After
          drying of the gel, bands corresponding to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-bound oligonucleotides and unbound
          oligonucleotides were visualized by autoradiography,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">excised</ENAMEX> and counted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scintillation</ENAMEX> counter for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cleavage assay
          The cleavage assays were carried out with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> pmole of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-end labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-10</ENAMEX> pmoles of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topoisomerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Top67</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the buffer used for
          the gel mobility shift assay. After incubation at 37Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 20</TIMEX> min, an equal volume of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> formamide, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KOH</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> bromophenol blue and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> xylene cyanol was
          added to stop the reactions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were analyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> sequencing gel followed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoradiography</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+induced reversal of cleavage
          The conditions were modified from those described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The cleavage reactions were incubated
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> and then divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> aliquots.
          The cleavage products were trapped in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> aliquot by the
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) alone or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> with MgCl
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 mM</NUMEX>) were added to the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliquots</ENAMEX> followed by further incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for up to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> before the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>. The products were
          analyzed as described for the cleavage reactions.
        
        
          Catenation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nicked DNA</ENAMEX> circles
          The catenation reaction was carried out with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.4 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nicked PM2</ENAMEX> phage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . After incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for up
          to1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, the reactions were stopped with the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>. The products were analyzed as
