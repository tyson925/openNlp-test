        Statins, potent compounds that inhibit cholesterol
        synthesis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> by blocking
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-hydroxy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CoA</ENAMEX>), have been
        reported to induce osteoblast activity and lead to bone
        formation, both in tissue culture and in rats and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . These findings, if confirmed and extended to
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, have the potential to introduce immediate
        new treatment options to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with low bone mass and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX>. Such treatment is readily available, since an
        estimated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> alone take statins
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to treat hyperlipidemia with few side effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteoporosis</ENAMEX> is increasingly recognized as an eminent
        public health problem, as the mean age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> increases and costs related to
        osteoporosis are expected to grow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-fold by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2040</TIMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Health and Nutrition</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination Survey</ENAMEX>, using a definition of osteoporosis
        developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>, estimate that
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 20%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>
        have osteoporosis and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 50%</NUMEX> have low bone mass.
        Non-caucasian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> tend to have lower rates of
        osteoporosis but contribute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 25%</NUMEX> of the fractures
        annually [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        The only bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anabolic agent</ENAMEX> known to increase bone
        mineral density in both animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and clinical settings
        is human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parathyroid hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-34</ENAMEX> (PTH), which has recently
        been approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Bone-related basic and clinical
        research has been searching intensively for alternative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anabolic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for the treatment of osteoporosis.
        Due to the potential clinical impact of statins as a
        treatment option for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with low bone mass and
        osteoporosis, it is essential to evaluate its anabolic
        activity in several 
        in vitro and experimental animal
        models. We have recently reported the anabolic action of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTH</ENAMEX> in an ovariectomized (OVX) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> mouse model,
        which like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model, displays a substantial amount of
        trabecular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> in its femoral metaphyses and a
        quantifiable loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OVX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The aim of
        this study was to investigate the effect of simvastatin on
        the microarchitecture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> in an established <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model
        of osteoporosis, and compare its anabolic action with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTH</ENAMEX>.
        We also verified the presence of systemically administered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">simvastatin</ENAMEX> in the mouse serum, as this has previously not
        been reported and is likely to be of critical importance
        when evaluating the effect of simvastatin on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>.

            Sample preparation
            All sample preparation procedures were carried out
            in an ice-water bath. Stock solution of simvastatin was

            followed by extraction and injection into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LC-MS</ENAMEX>, to
            similar doses directly injected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">LC-MS. The</ENAMEX>
            quantitation was based on integration of the area under

            prior to extraction.
          
          
            Extraction procedure
            This procedure was based on the previously published
            protocol by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , implementing minor
            modifications. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solid-phase</ENAMEX> extraction cartridge (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ml/100</NUMEX> mg) was conditioned with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Methanol-water</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX>).
            The diluted sample (see Sample preparation) was loaded
            on to each cartridge, followed by low vacuum (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 min</ENAMEX>),
            and each cartridge was subsequently washed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml H

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and dried for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> min. Each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartridge</ENAMEX> was then eluted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>-water
            (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70:30</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of acetonitrile,
            followed by low vacuum (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 min</ENAMEX>). The combined eluates
            were evaporated to dryness in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpeedVac</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45Â°C</TIMEX>. The
            dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were reconstituted in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> of ammonium

            reconstituted extracts were transferred into
            autosampler vials and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> of each sample were
            injected on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX> column (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 Î¼l</NUMEX> of

            Osteocalcin assay
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was sampled prior to sacrifice to determine
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> levels of osteocalcin (OC). Serum intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OC</ENAMEX> was
            measured by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA

          In this study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX> was administered by gavage, and
          requires hepatic conversion to the metabolically active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î²-hydroxy acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS-OH</ENAMEX>). Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX> failed to have any
          effect on any static Î¼CT parameter measured at either
          site in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse femur</ENAMEX>, we conducted separate experiments
          designed to detect the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH in mouse serum

        Discussion
        The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
        Simvastatin on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> in an established <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX> outbred mouse strain
        utilized in this study has proven to be a valuable model
        for investigating the efficacy of both anabolic and
        anti-resorptive therapies for the treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX>. Here, we have used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PTH</ENAMEX> as a positive control
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , and compared its effects to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>. While PTH
        demonstrated the expected anabolic effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, SVS
        failed to stimulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation, despite our
        verification by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC/MS</ENAMEX> of the active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH metabolite in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse serum</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH metabolite is first detectable in mouse serum
        by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> after gavage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, and serum levels
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS-OH</ENAMEX> continued to be observed by both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mass-spectrometric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> measurements through the last
        serum samples collected at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 minutes</TIMEX> post-gavage. Other
        experiments failed to detect SVS-OH at longer post-gavage
        timepoints of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 and 24 hours</TIMEX>. These data are in general
        agreement with studies in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and canines that
        calculate peak serum levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-60 minutes</TIMEX>
        after gavage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Thus, although we
        failed to document any bone anabolic activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX> in a
        mouse model of OVX-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoporosis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC/MS</ENAMEX> analysis of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH metabolite in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse serum</ENAMEX> document the efficacy
        of our gavage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX> to experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Extrapolating from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the dose of SVS
        administered in this study was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 400</NUMEX>-fold
        higher than the average dose given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. The results
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simvastatin</ENAMEX> does not enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation in
        this mouse model 
        in vivo , despite our ability to
        verify the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH metabolite in mouse serum
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC/MS</ENAMEX> analysis. Furthermore, the osteocalcin assay did
        not suggest any increase in osteoblast activity in SVS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">treated mice</ENAMEX>, consistent with its failure to increase bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>.
        It is generally accepted that the hydroxy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> form of
        statins are potent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coenzyme A</ENAMEX> (HMG-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CoA</ENAMEX>) reductase, an enzyme that plays a
        critical role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol metabolism</ENAMEX>, where they block
        substrate accessibility to HMG-CoA reductase, effectively
        subverting cholesterol levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . In
        addition to lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statins</ENAMEX> seem to have a
        number of additional effects, such as the nitric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">oxide-mediated</ENAMEX> promotion of new blood vessel growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        , protection against oxidative modification of low-density
        lipoprotein, as well as anti-inflammatory effects and a
        reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . All statins
        limit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> biosynthesis by inhibiting the committed
        step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and sterols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Considering the enormous potential impact of statins on
        the treatment of osteoporosis, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have further
        investigated the skeletal effects of statin use. Several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have failed to confirm the initially reported
        anabolic effect of systemically administered statins 
        in vivo in rats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . One
        obvious criticism of the negative data in these studies is
        that they did not verify the actual presence of statin in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal serum</ENAMEX>. This limitation may be of importance, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crawford et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] could detect an increase in cortical
        bone when statin was administered locally. Our study
        demonstrated the presence of systemically administered the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH metabolite in the mouse serum by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC/MS</ENAMEX> analysis.
        The exact mechanism by which statins perform their
        effects on bone cell function is a central issue. It has
        been hypothesized that statins mediate their effects by
        increasing the expression in bone of the growth factor bone
        morphogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP-2</ENAMEX>) which in turn leads to
        osteoblast differentiation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . This
        mechanism of action has been addressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baumann et al.</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, where the anabolic effect of lovastatin on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> was
        at least partially due to their inhibiting effect on
        osteoclast development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, in the mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calvaria</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gasser et al.</ENAMEX> failed to detect any anabolic
        activity of statins in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and suggested that the
        disruption of the capillary integrity and local bleeding
        might explain some of the previously reported bone
        responses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Several studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> reported a decreased risk of
        fracture after statin treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 29 30</ENAMEX> ] . However
        larger human studies failed to confirm statins beneficial
        effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaCroix et al.</ENAMEX> found the risk of hip and
        arm fracture to be similar among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who used statins and
        those who did not take lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lowering medication</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Staa</ENAMEX> et al. examining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">218,062</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with a
        fracture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Practice Database</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>, and found no relationship between statin use and
        nonspine fracture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, a report by Meier
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] had used the exact same database as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Staa</ENAMEX> et al. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] , but sampled a much larger cohort (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">218,062</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with fracture) than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meier</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3940</TIMEX>), and in
        addition, selected an age and gender matched control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for every fracture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The clinical data
        available at the moment does not allow the conclusion that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">statin</ENAMEX> treatment has a postive relationship with fracture
        risk.
        Similarly as described in the clinical trials, the early
        animal studies reported data supportive of the initial
        findings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4 5 6 33 34</NUMEX> ] . These results however, were
        not substantiated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>, where SVS
        had no or little effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone mineral density</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        However, none of the studies has verified the actual
        presence of the active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH metabolite in the animal
        serum, as shown in this study. In combination with the
        osteocalcin data, this report provides strong evidence that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">simvastatin</ENAMEX> does not have an effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">established Swiss Webster</ENAMEX> mouse model of OVX-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In summary, the currently available data on the effects
        of statins on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> has done little to confirm the finding
        that statin therapy increases bone mass and thereby lowers
        fracture risk. Few of the studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
        have been able to show a predictable beneficial effect on
        bone mass and bone turnover. This report verifies the
        presence of the active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVS</ENAMEX>-OH metabolite in the mouse serum
        yet failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statins</ENAMEX> have clear effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation 
        in vitro , the formulation of
        existing 'liver-targeted' statins may require further
        refinement for efficacy on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation 
        in vivo .
