        On the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequence homo logy</ENAMEX> and similarity of
        three-dimensional structures, phosphoprotein phosphatases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPases</ENAMEX>) have been classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">designated PPP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPM</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTP</ENAMEX> [reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are comprised of phosphoserine- and
        phosphothreonine-specific enzymes whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTP</ENAMEX> family
        consists of phosphotyrosine-specific and dual-specificity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are
        PP1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2B</TIMEX> (calcineurin) class of phosphatases.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein phosphatase 5</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PP5</NUMEX>), a newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the PPP
        family, differs from the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatases in that
        it contains regulatory and (sub)cellular targeting
        functions within a single polypeptide [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . While its
        catalytic core exhibits strong similarity to those of the
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N-terminus</ENAMEX> consists of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that are unique to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> class. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TPR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> consist of a series of
        antiparallel amphipathic Î± helices that bundle together
        through hydrophobic interactions to form a cradle-shaped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groove</ENAMEX>, postulated to be involved in binding a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of regulatory importance such as heat shock
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein 90</ENAMEX>, a major cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apicomplexan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of parasites,
        exemplified by 
        Plasmodia, are major disease agents
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. As the causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plasmodia sp</ENAMEX>. alone infects about 300
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> globally and results in an annual death toll
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 2 million</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . 
        Plasmodium falciparum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX>) is the
        most virulent of all and causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fatal cerebral malaria</ENAMEX>.
        Because of the continual emergence of drug-resistant
        parasites throughout the world, a need for a fundamental
        knowledge of the signaling pathways of the parasite has
        been recognized. In the recent past, this has led to the
        identification of a number of 
        Plasmodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatases</ENAMEX>, some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , others experimentally demonstrated
        [e.g., [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] ]. Most of these phosphatases resembled
        the classical mammalian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2B and PP2C</TIMEX> enzymes [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 14 16</NUMEX> ] , and some were potentially novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        In this report, we describe the cloning and
        characterization of a novel PP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphatase</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PfPP5</NUMEX>)
        that contains an unusually long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extension that
        contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> putative TPR motifs and played an important
        role in fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-mediated activation of the enzyme. The
        structural and biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> described
        herein are hallmarks of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> class, and thus establish
        PfPP5 as a likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in parasitic signal transduction,
        and hence a potential target for antimalarial drug
        design.
      
      
        Results
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> and gene
          To identify new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX>, we have
          recently undertaken a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based approach. At first, we
          made degenerate deoxyoligonuclotide primers corresponding
          to the conserved peptide sequences <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDXHGQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDXVDRG</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . An <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp PCR</ENAMEX> product,
          obtained by using these primers with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pf 3D7</ENAMEX> genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as template, was cloned in the pGEM-T vector
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>) using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T/A</ENAMEX> cloning strategy. Sequencing of
          individual clones revealed a variety of potential PPP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX>, one of which was an exact match with a
          putative open reading frame (ORF) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX> chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> in
          the sequence database of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sanger Center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Accession</ENAMEX> No.
          AL049185). Comparison of the predicted primary structure
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> clearly revealed its similarity with known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, including the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple TPR</ENAMEX> domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Specific primers were
          then made against this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1578</TIMEX> base pair gene
          was cloned and confirmed by sequencing. The same set of
          primers were then used to amplify the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP5</NUMEX> cDNA sequence
          from a poly(A)-enriched mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX> strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dd2</TIMEX>.
          This sequence fully matched the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanger</ENAMEX> sequence,
          suggesting the lack of introns in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP5</NUMEX> gene.
        
        
          Recombinant expression of PfPP5
          To express the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5 protein</ENAMEX>, we subcloned it
          in the bacterial expression vector pET<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-15b</ENAMEX> and introduced
          the plasmids into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli BL21</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>). As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, when induced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX>, the pET<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-15b-PfPP5</ENAMEX> clone
          produced a polypeptide of approximate Mr <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> k (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
          which is in excellent agreement with the calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69,139</NUMEX>, considering that pET<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-15b</TIMEX> adds a (His) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> tag (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 2 kDa</NUMEX>) to the N-terminus
          of the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The presence of the (His) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> tag could be confirmed by anti-His
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in immunoblot (data not shown). The His-tagged
          PfPP5 was subsequently purified through standard
          nickel-chelation chromatography (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, lane 5</ENAMEX>). Using
          32P-labeled histone as substrate under standard assay
          conditions (in absence of any activator), the specific
          activity of the recombinant PfPP5 was measured to be 198
          Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> nmoles of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">32P/min/mg enzyme.</ENAMEX>
          The deletion mutant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”TPR-PfPP5</ENAMEX>, was similarly cloned
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using a primer corresponding to the internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and purified by nickel chelation affinity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX>. The deletion mutant starts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met-273</ENAMEX>,
          as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native parasitic</ENAMEX> PP5
          To identify whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP5</ENAMEX> is actually expressed in the
          parasite, cell-free extracts of the asynchronous
          erythrocytic stage parasites were subjected to standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatographic</ENAMEX> procedures that had been previously
          optimized for human PP5 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Studies of mammalian PP5
          have revealed that the TPR domain might act as an
          auto-inhibitory domain of the phosphatase activity, and
          that tryptic digestion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> causes loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> and
          concomitant stimulation of activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . As
          described under <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods</ENAMEX>, the purification
          was in fact monitored by assaying for a trypsin-activated
          phosphatase with the assumption that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> may behave
          like mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> in this regard [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 20 21</NUMEX> ] . As
          mentioned, the activity peaks always coincided with a ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>
          kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in parallel Western analyses of the
          chromatographic fractions. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE, the partially
          purified fraction contained a major polypeptide of the
          expected size (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">69 kDa</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, lane 2</ENAMEX>). In Western blot,
          the rabbit antibody raised against the purified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant protein</ENAMEX> also specifically reacted with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native polypeptide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, lanes 5, 6</ENAMEX>). A similar
          fraction prepared from uninfected erythrocytes contained
          very little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4, lane 3</ENAMEX>), and did not react
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). A pre-immune serum served as
          a negative control (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4, lane 9</ENAMEX>). As expected, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native Pf protein</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX> kDa smaller than the
          His-tagged recombinant (compare the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in lanes
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 5</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> with the recombinant in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 8</TIMEX>). Using
          phosphohistone as substrate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Pf</ENAMEX> enzyme
          exhibited a specific activity of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">210 Â± 20 nmoles</NUMEX> of 32P
          per minute per mg enzyme, which is comparable to that of
          the recombinant enzyme. Together, these results
          demonstrated the equivalence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant proteins</ENAMEX>, and in turn, confirmed the
          authenticity of the cDNA sequence.
        
        
          Primary structure of PfPP5
          When the predicted primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5</ENAMEX> was
          aligned with known PP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the following
          features were obvious. First, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> contained the
          catalytic core found in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatases of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, including the signature motifs such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDXHGQ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDFVDRG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGNHE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGLL</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPNYCD</ENAMEX>, to name a few
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Site-directed mutagenesis and structural
          studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPÎ</ENAMEX>» have previously established the
          roles of specific amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> in these domains in
          the various aspects of catalysis, such as metal ion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX>, phosphate recognition, and co-ordination of
          water molecules [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] .
          While the catalytic core is generally necessary and
          sufficient for the phosphohydrolase activity of PPP
          enzymes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> outside the core play critical
          roles in binding accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or small molecules
          that modulate the catalytic activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] .
          Specifically in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> class, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> has been
          shown to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> motifs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , the
          three-dimensional structure of which is now also
          available [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Interestingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal sequence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5</ENAMEX> was the longest of all, and seemed to contain
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> TPR motifs instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Thus, in
          comparing the full sequences of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PP5s</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> PfPP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> were aligned with the others, and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> TPR of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5</ENAMEX> was left out. A detailed sequence
          analysis of all the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> is offered below.
          The TPR motif is a degenerate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> repeat
          that is often found in tandem arrays, sometimes separated
          by spacer sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . We propose such a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>-residue
          spacer between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Although no single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is absolutely invariant in
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX>, they do contain a largely conserved pattern of
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> similarity in terms of size, hydrophobicity,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spacing</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> are
          critically placed on the same face of their respective
          helices: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 8</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> on the first helix, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 24</TIMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          that are identical or have similar hydrophobicity are
          found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> proposed TPRs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5</ENAMEX> in the correct
          relative spacing. Moreover, secondary structure
          prediction suggested that each PfPP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> also has the
          potential to form the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conserved helices (A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>), as
          marked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Thus, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> may satisfy
          the structural requirements of a TPR motif.
          An <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 34-residue</NUMEX> stretch following the last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) shows weak similarity to a TPR motif.
          However, alpha-helix prediction and structure
          determination have shown that it is a single long helix
          that extends out of the TPR domain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, this
          region may not represent a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> and therefore, is
          simply marked as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">helix" in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Auto-inhibitory role of PfPP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>: activation by
          polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX>
          The biochemical properties further confirmed the
          PP5-like nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX> enzyme. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, members
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> class are distinguished by their profound
          stimulation by polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 30</NUMEX>
          ] . As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the phosphatase activity of PfPP5
          increased with increasing concentrations of arachidonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oleic acid</ENAMEX>. At its highest, the fatty-acid
          stimulated activity was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> times the basal activity
          and was exhibited at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 70</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 Î¼M</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arachinodic</ENAMEX> and oleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, respectively. In contrast,
          stearic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, a saturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, did not appreciably
          stimulate PfPP5 activity.
          To test the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> region in this activation, a
          TPR deletion mutant of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5 (Î”TPR-PfPP5</ENAMEX>) starting at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met-273</ENAMEX> was expressed with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal (His) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> tag. The recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          expressed from pET-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15b</NUMEX> clone and purified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ni</ENAMEX>-chelation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatography</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, lane 6</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE analysis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”TPR-PfPP5</ENAMEX> exhibited a Mr of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> k as
          expected (predicted size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,098</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> part plus
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> for the His 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> tag). Interestingly, the specific
          activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”TPR-PfPP5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3-</NUMEX>times that
          of the full-length PfPP5 without arachidonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">580</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 nmoles of 32P</NUMEX> per minute per mg enzyme; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Moreover, unlike the full-length enzyme, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”TPR-PfPP5</ENAMEX> was
          not activated by arachidonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TPR</ENAMEX> region is required for the activation.
          These results are reminiscent of similar studies done
          in other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> enzymes in which mutational inactivation of
          the TPR domain resulted in an elevated basal activity and
          concomitant reduced response to unsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . Such studies led to the proposal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains
          regulate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PP5</TIMEX> catalytic region in a negative manner
          and that the interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arachidonic acid</ENAMEX> with TPR
          relieves this auto-inhibition. This was further supported
          by the demonstration that trypsin cleaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX> in the
          "hinge" sequence connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TPR region</ENAMEX> and catalytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, and that such cleavage produced a highly active
          enzyme which was refractory to further activation by
          fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 20 21</NUMEX> ] . To test whether this is also
          true of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX>, we digested recombinant PfPP5 with
          trypsin, which resulted in the production of a
          trypsin-resistant fragment that was very similar in size
          to Î”TPR-PfPP5 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, lane 7</ENAMEX>). When assayed for
          phosphatase activity 
          in vitro, the trypsin-digested
          PfPP5 indeed behaved like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”TPR-PfPP5</ENAMEX> in that it was about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold more active than the full-length enzyme and was
          not activated by arachidonic acid any further (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Together these results suggest a role of PfPP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> in
          auto-inhibition and in fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-mediated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Okadaic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sensitivity of PfPP5
          The differential sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the PPP
          family to biological toxins has been exploited as a
          diagnostic tool in studying these phosphatases. The
          marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin okadaic acid</ENAMEX> (OA), in particular, inhibits
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP2A</NUMEX> class of phosphatases at sub-nanomolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IC50 ~ 0.05 nM</NUMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP1</NUMEX> class in the
          low nanomolar range (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IC50 ~ 5-45</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nM</ENAMEX>). The SAPNYC motif of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> enzymes is essential for OA-binding, and is found in
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OA-sensitive phosphatases</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A</TIMEX>, and
          PP5 [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 27 28</NUMEX> ] , and references therein]. This motif
          is also present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Phosphatases</ENAMEX> lacking
          this motif include <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the PP2B</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP2C</NUMEX> classes, which are
          thus highly resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>. PP2A contains an additional
          Cys residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids downstream</ENAMEX> (underlined in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPNYCYRCG</ENAMEX>), believed to be important for the profound
          sensitivity of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cys</ENAMEX> is
          absent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5 enzymes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OA</ENAMEX> inhibited PfPP5 in a dose-dependent manner,
          with an IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.1 Â± 0.2 nM</NUMEX>. This moderate
          OA-sensitivity further establishes the identity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX>,
          since other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP5 enzymes</ENAMEX> also exhibit an IC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> value for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-6</ENAMEX> nM range [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . The Î”TPR mutant exhibited an essentially identical
          IC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> (not shown), supporting the notion
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains do not play a direct role in the
          interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          PfPP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds Pf</ENAMEX> heat shock protein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hsp90</NUMEX>)
          Hsp90 is a highly conserved molecular chaperone
          necessary for viability and for proper folding,
          processing, and function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian hsp90</ENAMEX> has been shown to specifically interact
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX>, and this interaction may have important
          consequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PP5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . An
          hsp90 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ortholog</ENAMEX> has been described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , but its
          function is currently unknown. It was, therefore, logical
          for us to ask whether an interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> and
          hsp90 also occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX>. To initiate these studies, we
          performed a co-immunoprecipitation analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracts</ENAMEX> in which complexes containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX> were first
          precipitated with anti-PP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and the precipitate
          then probed with anti-hsp90 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in Western blot.
          Results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pfhsp90</ENAMEX> is indeed found in
          complex with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX>, suggesting a potential role of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> in the mutual regulation of these two
          important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The "control" non-immune serum did
          not react with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and did not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precipitate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hsp90</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We provide biochemical and molecular evidence for a PP5
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein Ser/Thr</ENAMEX> phosphatase of 
        P. falciparum that has the catalytic
        core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPP</ENAMEX> superfamily and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tetratricopeptide
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>) repeat (TPR) domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2</ENAMEX>). We have
        therefore, tentatively named this enzyme <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX>. To our
        knowledge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP5</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>-containing 
        Plasmodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> reported at this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. These domains, and the associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> such as
        activation by unsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are by far the most
        noteworthy features of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX>.
        Recently, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP5</NUMEX> phosphatase was identified in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trypanosoma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] that contained the
        prototype <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> TPR
        domains at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX>. While mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> is activated
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-40</NUMEX> fold by arachidonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trypanosoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX>, like its 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), was
        also activated only modestly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX>-fold. Although the
        reason behind the lower activation potential is unknown, at
        least in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> it correlates with a similar fold activation
        following loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains through either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> or proteolytic cleavage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 5</ENAMEX>). Thus, it
        appears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains of the primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parasitic</ENAMEX> PP5
        may be less auto-inhibitory that those of their higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> counterparts. Recent mutational analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant PP5</ENAMEX> has identified sequences important in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoinhibition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutation of Glu-76</ENAMEX> (underlined in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> projects away
        from the TPR groove, resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> elevation of
        basal activity, and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu</ENAMEX> is conserved in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trypanosoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A role of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end in autoinhibition was conjectured based
        on the finding that mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gln-495</ENAMEX> (underlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) elevated basal activity by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . This residue
        is also found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pf</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gln-592</ENAMEX>) although it is not conserved
        in a number of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5 sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Clearly,
        detailed mutational analysis of these domains should shed
        light on the mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfPP5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">autoinhibition</ENAMEX> and the role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyunsaturated fatty acids</ENAMEX> in preventing it.
        The TPR motif was originally identified as a protein
        interaction module in the cell division cycle (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] but has since been shown to
        occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with diverse functions in a variety of
        species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains, the spacing
        between them, and their placement in the primary structure
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> appear variable, and the relative
        contribution of the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPRs</ENAMEX> in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has
        not been studied. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least four</NUMEX> major kinds of
        macromolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> have been identified that involve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains. These include <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> involved in anaphase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promotion</ENAMEX>, transcription repression, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> import, and
        molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperoning</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid analysis
        and 
        in vitro interaction studies have
        shown that the TPR domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> interacts with the TPR
        domains of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDC16 and CDC27</TIMEX>, which may be important in
        recruiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">anaphase</ENAMEX> promoting complex (APC) and
        to the mitotic spindles during cell division (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38</NUMEX>).
        Interaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> with heat shock protein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX>, a chaperone,
        has received special attention because of its potential to
        regulate a variety of pathways. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> is a major
        component of mature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocorticoid</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of
        higher eukaryotes and appears to regulate glucocorticoid
        receptor function 
        in vivo [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] and references
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therein</ENAMEX>]. Such observations suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5</TIMEX> may act as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-chaperone for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hsp90</TIMEX> and raise the possibility that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein dephosphorylation</ENAMEX> may play an important regulatory
        role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> folding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, recent
        studies have identified a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of mammalian PP5
        critically important for its interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hsp90</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        . As marked on the human PP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> (underlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the
        corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lys-32</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lys-97</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg-101</ENAMEX>. It
        is notable that the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in PfPP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX>. The availability of full-length and
        TPR-deleted recombinant PfPP5 clones will now allow us to
        further investigate the exact nature of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP5</NUMEX>-Pfhsp90
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, and map the interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5 residues</ENAMEX> through
        site-directed mutagenesis. Clearly, the discovery of PfPP5
        and its interaction with homologous hsp90 will open up new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX> in parasitic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>/ gene regulation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX>, and may lead to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        PfPP5 represents the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> TPR-containing protein
        discovered in the 
        Apicomplexan parasites. In view of
        the essential role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        interaction, further studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5</ENAMEX> and its TPR domain
        will shed new light on phosphatase regulation and the role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP5</ENAMEX> in these clinically important parasites. As with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian PP5</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfPP5</TIMEX> may also play an important role in
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> through its interaction with parasitic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Interaction between the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP5</ENAMEX> and heat shock protein
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> may reflect a mutual relationship between protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> and protein folding in this parasite. The
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPR</ENAMEX> in this interaction can be addressed through
        structure-function analysis of the recombinant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and other procedures
          The following oligodeoxynucleotide primers were
          designed against the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfPP5 sequence</ENAMEX> found on
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AL049185</TIMEX>; 
          Plasmodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">falciparum chr13</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">002073</ENAMEX>):

          These primers were used to amplify the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PfPP5</NUMEX> gene or the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Pf3D7</NUMEX> genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dd2</TIMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as
          template with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, respectively. The RT
          reaction was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMV</ENAMEX> reverse transcriptase,
          and all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> were performed with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> mixture of
          Taq:Pfu polymerase. The products were cloned into pGEM-T
          and confirmed by sequencing. The genomic and cDNA
          sequences were identical. This sequence was then
          subcloned into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XhoI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BamHI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of the pET-15b
          vector by designing similar primers but containing the
          respective restriction sites. The TPR deletion mutant,
          starting at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu-274</ENAMEX> (bold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), was also amplified
          in a similar manner using specific primers, and then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX>. Introduction of the plasmids into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli BL21</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing
          the compatible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RIG plasmid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , induction of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPTG</ENAMEX>, and purification through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX>-chelation
          chromatography were performed using the His-Bind kit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagents</ENAMEX> and procedure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>).
          Antibodies against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP5 and hsp90</TIMEX> were raised in rabbit
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, respectively, using standard procedures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ]
          . Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and Western blot using chemiluminescence-based
          detection were performed essentially as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          . Immunoprecipitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PfPP5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> followed by
          immunoblot analysis of the precipitate were carried out
          essentially as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodiumand</ENAMEX> purification of
          PfPP5
          
          P. falciparum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3D7</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Dd2</NUMEX>) was
          grown in human A-positive erythrocytes and infected cells
          were harvested at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15%</NUMEX> parasitemia and lysed by the
          saponin method essentially as described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . PfPP5
          was partially purified using published procedures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
          . In brief, the parasites were resuspended in buffer A
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris-Cl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> glycerol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM DTT) plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mM NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>, leupeptin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aprotinin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) at an approximate protein
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 mg</NUMEX> per ml. The suspension was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sonicated</ENAMEX> and the lysate centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> Ã— g for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. The supernatant, called "total extract", was
          subjected to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%-60%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate fractionation</ENAMEX>. The
          pellet was resuspended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ml of buffer B (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 mM HEPES</TIMEX>,
          pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM DTT), desalted on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadex G-25</ENAMEX>
          column equilibrated with buffer B, then subjected to
          sequential chromatography on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 ml</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HiTrap</ENAMEX> heparin column
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>) and then a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">HiTrap Q</ENAMEX> column (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>).
          PP5 activity was followed during the purification by
          assaying trypsin-stimulated pNPPase activity. The
          fractions were further confirmed by Western blot using
          anti-PfPP5 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parasite</ENAMEX> culture was synchronized
          essentially as described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Phosphatase assay
          Phosphatase activity against pNPP or phosphohistone
          substrates was determined essentially as described
          previously. Standard assays were performed in buffer A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">containing 1</ENAMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, and additional activators or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were added only where mentioned. Reactions
          were incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. 32P-labeled phosphohistone was
          made as described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 18</NUMEX> ] . When using
          phosphohistone as substrate, reactions were carried out
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80 Î</TIMEX>¼l followed by quantification of the liberated 32Pi
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">phosphomolybdate</ENAMEX> extraction assay [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 18</NUMEX> ] .
          Reactions were followed with time, and results were
          corrected by subtraction of the corresponding values from
          an enzyme-free reaction. When 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -nitrophenylphosphate</ENAMEX> was used as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> (at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 mM</NUMEX>), the reaction was scaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 200</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼l</ENAMEX>, and the liberated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -nitrophenol</ENAMEX> was quantitated by
          measurement of absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">415</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nm</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 23</NUMEX> ] .
          Phosphatase reactions were routinely initiated with the
          addition of substrate. Dephosphorylation was kept to less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> of the total phosphorylated substrate, and the
          reaction was linear with respect to enzyme concentration
          and time. When using potential activators (e.g., fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acids</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">okadaic acid</ENAMEX>), they were
          added to the enzyme mixture <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> prior to
          initiating the reaction with the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrate</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] .
