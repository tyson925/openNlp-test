        Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fhit protein</ENAMEX> is among the earliest known events
        in the development of a variety of the most common and
        lethal human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">malignancies</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX> leads to
        cells that are deficient in programmed cell death and that
        form tumors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> reexpression in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX>-cancer
        cells reduces tumorigenicity and restores programmed cell
        death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Infection of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fhit +/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with viruses that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re-express Fhit</ENAMEX> reduce cancer occurrence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , apparently
        by killing pre-neoplastic cells that have lost the
        wild-type 
        Fhit allele. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Fhit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the histidine triad
        superfamily of nucleotide-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, binds and
        hydrolyzes diadenosine polyphosphates such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppA</ENAMEX> ( 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ADP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>,
        respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . His96, which is responsible for

        enhancement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ApppA</ENAMEX> hydrolysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11 12 13</ENAMEX> ] , is
        nonetheless dispensable for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ApppA</ENAMEX>-binding and tumor
        suppression, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> function in tumor
        suppression depends on formation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>S complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 12</ENAMEX> ]
        . If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX>-substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> promote tumor suppression by
        stimulating a pro-apoptotic effector, then Fhit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        that resemble natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrates</ENAMEX> may promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Fhit</ENAMEX> function.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> with normative features may
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonize Fhit</ENAMEX> function. Either class of compounds may be
        important in dissecting Fhit cell biology and regulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.

        Results and Discussion
        A series of compounds 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-6</ENAMEX> were synthesized and evaluated for
        Fhit inhibition that link <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two 5</TIMEX>'-

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycol</ENAMEX> to 
        meso -erythritol. Sodium salts of
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> were titrated into assays of purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.8 μM</NUMEX> fluorescent substrate,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>

        the inhibitor concentration-dependence in reduction of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (apparent) for substrate hydrolysis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> 
        2b and 
        3b with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-carbon diol linkers were
        either only as inhibitory as the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrate 1</ENAMEX> or
        substantially less so. Inhibitor 
        4b with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four-carbon</NUMEX> linker was as
        ineffective as 
        3b. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Inhibitors</ENAMEX> 
        5a and 
        6a that substitute a central CH 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -PO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -CH

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -CH(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>)-CH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -O-PO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were as inhibitory as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is a good substrate. The
        phosphorothioate analogs, 
        5b and 
        6b, bound <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10 and 75</NUMEX> times
        better to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX> than 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Thus, conservation of bond-lengths
        between adenylate moieties of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> is conducive to binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX>.
        Because phosphorothioate analogs of 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> were better <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> than the
        corresponding phosphates, phosphorodithioate analog 
        6c was prepared together with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        additional compounds as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphates</ENAMEX> and phosphorothioates.
        Phosphorodithioate 
        6c was a less effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">inhibitor</TIMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8600</TIMEX> nM, not shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tables</ENAMEX>) than
        corresponding phosphate 
        6a and phosphorothioate 
        6b and, as demonstrated in Tables 1and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the phosphorothioate congener of every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> made as
        a phosphate and a phosphorothioate had a lower 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i value. The contribution of particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-chiral phosphorothioate stereoisomers to inhibition has
        not been examined. When diadenosine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX>"'-( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">methylene</NUMEX>-

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-triphosphate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] was
        crystallized with wild-type and mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fhit</ENAMEX>, the
        α-phosphorothioate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was found in the mutant but not
        wild-type active site, suggesting that α-phosphorothioate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> may be slow substrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frey</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> slowly cleaves both R 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> and S 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> stereoisomers of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">γ-</NUMEX>( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m -nitrobenzyl</ENAMEX>)-adenosine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> -(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l-thiotriphosphate</TIMEX>) with modest
        and similar beneficial effects on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> as compared to the corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Given the inhibitor activity of 
        6b, the contribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> in
        the position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">α-β bridging oxygen</ENAMEX> of 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was examined. As can be seen in Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, comparison of 
        9b with 
        10b and 
        11b and of 
        15b with 
        16b indicated that imido or sulfur
        substitutions for oxygen reduce enzyme inhibition by an
        order of magnitude. Derivatives of 
        6b with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> additional
        functionalities on the central <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> were characterized.
        Analysis of 
        9b indicated that loss of the polar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> reduces inhibitory activity and analysis of 
        7b and 
        8b indicated that nearly isosteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that are nonisoelectronic are not tolerated. The
        magnitude of these effects was surprising and may be
        related to altered conformations upon manganese
        coordination. Earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackburn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> made
        "supercharged" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methane-trisphosphonic acid AppppA</ENAMEX> analogs
        containing a central <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> from which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> adenylate or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> moieties are bonded [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In work presented
        here, tripodal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> 
        15a and 
        17a showed, respectively, micromolar
        and submicromolar efficacies while the phosphorothioate
        counterparts 
        15b and 
        17b showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM efficacy.
        Derivatives of pentaerythritol, tetrapodal compounds 
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,13 and</NUMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, were also evaluated for Fhit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX>. While compound 
        14b, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phosphorothioylated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> without adenosine, was barely a submicromolar
        inhibitor, compounds 
        12b and 
        13b, which contain respectively three
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> CH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -phosphorothioadenosyl groups bonded
        to the central <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> nM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, while the simplest compound 
        6b was initially rendered less
        inhibitory by modification because its central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hydroxyl</ENAMEX> was
        important for inhibition, addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> CH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -phosphorothioadenosyl groups restored
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX>. We presume that compounds 
        6b , 
        12b and 
        13b with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> identical CH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -phosphorothioadenosyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> can
        present a manganese bound 
        6b -like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> in a similar
        manner. On the basis that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> binds diadenosine
        polyphosphates with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> buried and the other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adenosine</ENAMEX> solvent-exposed in a specific conformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        , effective tri and tetrapodal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> such as 
        12b, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13b</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX>(ADP) 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] may exist in solution
        predominantly in a conformation that resembles Fhit-bound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppA</ENAMEX>.
        On the basis of observations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] discussed above,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppA</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phosphorothioadenosyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substituents</ENAMEX> to be a slow substrate with a relatively low 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> in place of the β
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phosphorus</ENAMEX> (for example in 
        6b ) would make the leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> the
        alkoxide - OCH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -CH(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX>)-CH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-phosphorothioadenosyl rather than
        α-thio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Presumably, because normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> products are
        mononucleotides with low p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        a values, the enzyme does not have a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> to protonate an alkoxide leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and thus
        substitution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> for the β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX> turns a
        substrate into an inhibitor.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Tumor suppression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> is not destroyed by mutation
        of the nucleophilic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">His96</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asn</ENAMEX>, a mutation that
        specifically reduces 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 12</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, evidence suggests
        that the proapoptotic function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> depends on formation
        of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. If the substrate-dependent signaling
        model is correct, then compound 
        6b, as a nearly isosteric AppppA analog
        with a low 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i , may promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Fhit</ENAMEX> signaling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX>+
        cells. Compound 
        12b, which one would expect to bind
        Fhit with bulky phosphorothioate and phosphorothioadenosyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> interfering with putative effector binding, may
        consequently prove to be antagonistic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> function.
        Ongoing 
        in vitro studies aim to evaluate the
        stereochemistry of phosphorothioyl binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> while 
        in vivo studies test the effects of
        these compounds on programmed cell death. Phosphorothioate
        analogs 
        6b and 
        12b that preserve the α-β bridging
        oxygen but substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> for the β <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX>,
        achieving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65 to 75</NUMEX>-fold binding advantages over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AppppA</ENAMEX>, are
        expected to be critical for cell biological
        characterization.
