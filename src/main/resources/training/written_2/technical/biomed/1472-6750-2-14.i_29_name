        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have been widely adopted in genomics
        because of the their ability to simultaneously examine the
        expression levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes. As a result, the
        scope of applications for microarrays has broadened
        rapidly, from drug discovery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , to classification of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] and analysis of splice variants [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Novel analytical tools have been constructed to address
        every component of the microarray experiment and optimize
        performance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . However, ideal systems with maximized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and data reproducibility have not been
        achieved. One approach to enhance sensitivity in
        microarrays, using a novel signal amplification technique,
        has recently been reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Another approach is to
        increase the affinity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> present on
        the array) for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> through modifications to the
        length [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , chemistry [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , or physical structure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>.
        Naturally occurring analogs of purine and pyrimidine
        bases have been examined extensively for their ability to
        increase the thermodynamic stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplexes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . Among these are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-aminoadenine also known as diaminopurine (DAP), which is
        found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S-2L</ENAMEX> cyanophage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> uracil
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl cytidine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX>). Previous studies have
        shown the ribonucleoside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">triphosphate</ENAMEX> derivatives of
        modified bases to be effectively incorporated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , which make them an excellent
        substrate for use in microarray sample preparations
        requiring amplification through 
        in vitro transcriptions (IVTs).
        Due to their effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> stability and secondary
        structures and their lack of replication by DNA
        polymerases, modified nucleotides have recently been
        exploited in a variety of technologies in molecular biology
        and genomics. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl ribonucleotides</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-propynyl</ENAMEX>)pyrimidines have been chemically incorporated
        into oligonucleotides which were used to detect telomeric
        repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> in fluorescence 
        in situ hybridization (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISH</ENAMEX>) assays [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, chimeric primers containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deoxynucleotides</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl ribonucleotides</ENAMEX> have been
        used to eliminate artifacts, produced by exponential
        amplification of minor side-products, in cycle sequencing [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] .
        Recently, studies employing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA arrays</ENAMEX> have also
        examined the use of modified nucleotides such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-bromodeoxyuridine</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-methylthymidine in the probe
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . An alternative method to increase the
        probe-target affinity is to incorporate the modified
        ribonucleotide, as the triphosphate derivative, during the
        IVT process so that the cRNA produced has the desired level
        of substitution of the corresponding unmodified nucleotide.
        Such an approach has been demonstrated in a study which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> these modified cRNA products to high density
        oligonucleotide arrays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . However, that study
        measured the signal when amplifying a specific gene rather
        than a genome-wide approach. A genome-wide amplification,
        coupled with the incorporation of modified nucleotides,
        permits measurement of every transcript in the sample. To
        our knowledge, no systematic studies have been performed
        examining the incorporation of modified ribonucleotide
        triphosphates into cRNA, yield of amplified material,
        effects on hybridization intensities and reproducibility,
        and the impact on the differential expression ratios. It
        will not be possible to gauge the full potential,
        advantages, and disadvantages until such studies have been
        completed.
        In this study, we investigated the possibility that
        incorporation of modified nucleotides into complementary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (cRNA) target samples could increase signal intensity
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola Codelink™ Expression</ENAMEX> microarray platform.
        The ratios of modified to unmodified nucleoside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphates</ENAMEX> (NTPs) were varied in each target synthesis
        in order to measure the range of effects on cRNA yield,
        specific activity of target sample, hybridization signals,
        and differential expression ratios. Our results suggest
        that incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-aminoadenosine (DAP) triphosphate
        into target cRNA samples may increase hybridization signal
        intensity for a wide variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplexes</ENAMEX>. In
        contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-methyluridine and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-methylcytidine</NUMEX> had
        detrimental effects on signal intensities. Hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> was dependent on both target sequence and
        extent of substitution with the modified nucleotide.
        Concurrent incorporation of modified and unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> in
        a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio resulted in significantly greater numbers of
        above-threshold ratio calls across tissues, while
        preserving ratio integrity and reproducibility.
      
      
        Results
        
          Effect of modified nucleotides on cRNA yield and
          assessment of their incorporation and biotin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-UTP
          incorporation
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MeC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX> were tolerated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>, incorporation of these analogs into our IVT
          reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cocktails</ENAMEX> reduced the yields of amplified cRNA.
          The magnitude of the decrease was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-30%</NUMEX> and depended on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and the NTP modification. However,
          within the context of our pre-established assay
          conditions (a single color, single sample per array
          system using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> micrograms of cRNA), enough cRNA was
          generated from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> reaction to perform
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> in triplicate. Thus, we were able to
          normalize input amounts of cRNA for each condition tested
          in order to quantitatively compare relative changes due
          to each respective modification. In these experiments, we
          generated cRNA from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five micrograms</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and did
          not explore the impact on yield when smaller or larger
          amounts of input total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> are used.
          We next determined how well the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> were
          incorporated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> and whether
          incorporation of biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTP</ENAMEX> was altered due to the
          presence of these modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX>. To address these
          questions, we used an analytical method developed in our
          laboratory and described in a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          Briefly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cRNA is digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX> nuclease
          and calf intestinal phosphatase and applied to a high
          performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column to
          separate the nucleosides, followed by an absorbance
          measurement at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm. As seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>, when only
          the unmodified NTPs are incorporated during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX>,
          there is good separation of the individual nucleosides.
          Furthermore, as reported earlier [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , using the
          extinction coefficients and integrating the area under
          these peaks, there are approximately equal amounts of
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleosides. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> was added at a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX>
          molar ratio to the adenosine, the chromatogram showed
          incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> into the cRNA, and this level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX> appeared to be equivalent to the level of
          incorporation of adenosine (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Moreover, when
          the adenosine was fully substituted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> in the IVT
          reaction cocktail, only a peak corresponding to the DAP
          was detected (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>), and this peak was approximately
          equal in area to that of the adenosine in the control
          situation. Similarly, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MeC</ENAMEX> was fully substituted for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytidine</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> reaction cocktail, only a peak
          corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> was detected (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1D</NUMEX>), and
          this peak was approximately equal in area to that of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytidine</ENAMEX> in the control situation. In contrast, we were
          unable to examine incorporation levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX> because
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MeU</ENAMEX> peak was eluted at approximately the same time as
          the guanosine peak (data not shown). It is important to
          note that these analyses used the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cRNA and
          represent a global, average view of the incorporation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incorporation</ENAMEX> may differ somewhat depending on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, structure, or expression level of the nascent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA transcript</ENAMEX>. We therefore incorporated each of these
          modified nucleotides into a unique bacterial transcript,
          generated by run off transcription from a plasmid into
          which the gene was cloned. When this transcript was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">digested</ENAMEX> and applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>, we found similar
          results as seen with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cRNA (data not shown).
          We conclude that these modified nucleotides are
          incorporated during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> reaction at ratios which are
          reflective of the input ratio to the unmodified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>.
          Because the sensitivity and reproducibility of
          microarrays depends on the specific activity of target
          cRNA, we also wanted to determine if adding modified NTPs
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> changed the incorporation rate of
          biotin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-UTP. This biotinylated nucleotide is used in
          our biotin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">streptavidin</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Alexa647</NUMEX> conjugate detection
          system. We found that the level of biotinylated uridine,
          detected at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">294 nm</TIMEX> after digestion and application to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>, was unaffected by the presence of any of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modified NTPs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVT</ENAMEX> reaction cocktail (data not
          shown). Moreover, analysis of individual transcripts,
          which were enzymatically digested into mononucleosides,
          showed equivalent incorporation rates of biotin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-UTP
          for both control samples and target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modified ATP</ENAMEX>.
          Lastly, we examined what effect, if any, incorporation
          of modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> had on the length of the amplified cRNA.
          Transcript size was determined by running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> on an
          Agilent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2100</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BioAnalyzer</ENAMEX>. No difference was observed for
          either individual transcripts or complex samples in
          modified versus unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> samples (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Effect of modified nucleotides on hybridization
          signals and specificity
          We next determined the effect of these modified NTPs
          on hybridization intensities. After hybridization,
          scatter plots of hybridization intensities were generated
          comparing those intensities generated from unmodified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cRNA</ENAMEX> (control) to either the duplicate control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> or to intensities generated from cRNA where
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> was incorporated. The comparison
          of control versus control (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) illustrates that,
          if hybridization intensities are equal in the two
          conditions, the points should lie on the diagonal.
          Complete substitution of unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> (Figure
          2B) produced greater increases overall in individual
          probe signals than the target sample containing a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX>
          ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> to unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>), as would be
          expected if DAP incorporation increased the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hybrid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> stability. A quantitative estimation of
          assay performance increase can be derived from the median
          probe signal on each microarray. Although Figure 2Band
          2Cshow that increases in signal intensity are not linear
          for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences, median slide intensity across
          sets of duplicate hybridizations for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> (human embryonic kidney and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burkitt</ENAMEX>'s lymphoma)
          increased an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> +/- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7% and 99%</NUMEX> +/- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> for the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 DAP</TIMEX>:A and all DAP conditions, respectively, over the
          unmodified control sample. However, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Balso</NUMEX> shows
          that full substitution of adenosine by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> reduced the
          hybridization signals for many of the probes, generating
          a bowing towards the unmodified control condition and
          suggesting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> destabilizing effect of complete DAP
          substitution in certain sequence contexts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 23</NUMEX> ] . On
          a global scale, such a high incidence of probes with
          reduced hybridization signals may limit the usefulness of
          the complete DAP substitution. Of particular interest is
          the observation that the number of probes which have
          increased signal and the degree to which their signals
          are increased are highest at the lower end of the signal
          range. In contrast, both of the modified pyrimidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triphosphates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX>) tested resulted in a decrease
          in overall signal intensities for nearly all of the
          probes tested when compared against unmodified control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2D& 2E</ENAMEX>). However, data points on the
          right of the diagonal in figures 2Dand 2Ealso show that
          for a fractional set of target-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> pairs, substitution
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX> increased hybridization signal relative
          to the unmodified control. Those probes whose signal
          intensities were increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>-fold are
          summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX>, for a number of
          transcripts substitution with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX> may potentially
          augment hybridization signals more so than even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX>. This
          may prove useful for target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing very low
          concentrations of these particular transcripts.
          Nevertheless, because our goal was to utilize
          modifications that would increase hybridization signals
          for the vast majority of target-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> duplexes, we
          subsequently focused our efforts on the samples
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DAP</ENAMEX>.
          We next determined whether the increases in signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensity</ENAMEX> observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> substitution were similar in
          magnitude to those observed when the hybridization time
          is increased. We therefore hybridized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> micrograms of
          cRNA with no modifications or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> micrograms with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> at
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> molar ratio to adenosine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hours</TIMEX> and
          hybridized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> micrograms of cRNA with no modifications
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 hours</TIMEX>. We generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scatterplot and overplayed
          these scatterplot on each other (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scatterplot</ENAMEX> compares the intensities of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hour</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> with those of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 hour</TIMEX> control (orange
          signals). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> scatterplot compares the intensities
          of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hour</TIMEX> control with those of the DAP-modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cRNA</ENAMEX> (blue signals). The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer hybridization time</TIMEX>
          increases the median signal intensity by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> +/- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>. The
          increase is more pronounced for the medium and high
          signals. As shown before, the DAP-modified cRNA generated
          hybridization signals which were also increased relative
          to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hour</TIMEX> control hybridization. However, the
          increase seemed more pronounced for the low and medium
          signals. We conclude that both DAP modification and an
          increased hybridization time can affect the hybridization
          reaction but in very different ways.
          Because of the differential effects of increased
          hybridization time and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> substitution on low and high
          expressers, we wanted determine whether the increases
          seen of using both DAP modification and an extended
          hybridization time could be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>. We therefore
          hybridized unmodified (control) cRNA for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hours</TIMEX> and a
          DAP-modified cRNA for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 hours</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). The median
          slide intensity increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">110%</NUMEX> +/- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>, which is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> double the increase seen with either the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 DAP</TIMEX>:A or the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer hybridization time</TIMEX> by themselves.
          When all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 9,000</NUMEX> probes are divided
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> equally sized bins representing low, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>,
          and high expressers according to their respective signal
          intensities, the effects of increased hybridization time
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> become very evident (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>). Figure 3Cshows
          that the relative increases in signal intensities due to
          increased hybridization time are biased towards the
          medium and high expressers, with signals increasing an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48% and 84%</NUMEX>, respectively, whereas increases
          due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> substitution are more pronounced for low and
          medium expressers (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57% and 81%</NUMEX> increase, respectively).
          Together, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> modifications of increased
          hybridization time and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> substitution can be used in
          concert to amplify signal intensities for the entire
          range of probe signals, and as figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Cindicates</TIMEX>, these
          boosts in signals are approximately <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DAP-containing samples</ENAMEX>.
          We next determined the effect of modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> on
          hybridization specificity (the ability to distinguish
          sequences up to a certain homology). We addressed this
          issue by designing probes which had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> adjacent,
          centrally located mismatches and comparing hybridization
          signals generated from these mismatched probes to signals
          generated from their corresponding perfect matches. In
          the control situation (hybridization of unmodified cRNA),
          the hybridization intensity decreased as the number of
          mismatches increased, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mismatches</ENAMEX> generally
          destabilizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> sufficiently to reduce the
          hybridization signal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> of the parent signal. There
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>) where, even in the presence
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mismatches, the signal was not reduced below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>
          of the parent signal. This signal was low in the perfect
          match and, therefore, this situation most likely reflects
          a lowering to the noise levels. In fact, the signal was
          lowered to below threshold levels in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX>. When equimolar ratios of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> and unmodified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> were incorporated into the cRNA target (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX> DAP:A),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> was not significantly affected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Aand 4B</ENAMEX>). However, in one
          probe sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>), specificity was enhanced. For
          this test probe, the unmodified sample produced unusually
          high signals for base mismatches. Nevertheless, other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have seen similar improvements in mismatch
          discrimination with diaminopurine-containing oligo mers
          for different applications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> probe
          sequence demonstrated a smaller destabilizing effect of a
          single mismatch with the partially modified cRNA compared
          to the control (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4D</NUMEX>). In this sequence, the
          hybridization was reduced to the same extent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> using either the control or partially modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cRNA</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> substitution of adenosine by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> showed varied
          effects on specificity in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different probe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences, the fully
          modified cRNA behaved similarly to the control cRNA
          (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Aand 4B</ENAMEX>). In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequence, the
          specificity improved for the fully modified cRNA, as it
          did for the partially modified cRNA (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>). The
          improvement in specificity for this probe depended on the
          extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> modification. In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> probe sequence,
          the fully modified cRNA showed a dramatic decrease in
          specificity with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-base mismatches, although
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mismatches reduced the hybridization intensity to
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of that of the perfect match. The loss in
          specificity for this probe sequence also depended on the
          extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> modification, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, or three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> required to reduce the hybridization intensity
          to ~ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> for the control, partially modified, and fully
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modified</ENAMEX>, respectively, cRNA. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> test probe showed
          hybridization signal intensity below the negative control
          threshold in both the control and modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> samples,
          suggesting either an absence of the transcript from the
          target sample or abundance too low to quantify (data not
          shown). Repeat experiments with cRNA containing modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> supported the general specificity trend: unmodified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A > all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          Attempts to increase specificity in the all DAP condition
          by raising the temperature during hybridization from 37°C
          to 42°C or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47°C</TIMEX> were unsuccessful (data not shown).
          Others have been able to distinguish sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> homology [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] using the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-base
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mismatch/ 30</ENAMEX>-mer oligonucleotide signal near or below
          negative control threshold), and we support their
          findings here with the control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A condition.
          The fully MeC-substituted cRNA targets were examined with
          respect to specificity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> test sequences (Figures
          4Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4D</ENAMEX>). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test sequence (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>), the fully
          MeC-substituted cRNA targets behaved nearly identically
          to the partially DAP-substituted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. In the other
          test sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4D</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX>-substituted cRNA
          behaved nearly identically to the unmodified cRNA target
          and showed better specificity than that of the partially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX>-substituted cRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> with respect to the effect of
          one mismatch. We conclude that the specificity of fully
          MeC-substituted cRNA and partially DAP-substituted cRNA
          targets are, for the most part, equivalent and
          essentially no loss in specificity (as determined by the
          effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mismatches) is observed with these modified
          targets.
          An additional metric of specificity on the Codelink
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioarrays</ENAMEX> is the use of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54 negative</NUMEX> control bacterial
          probes spotted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4X</TIMEX> redundancy, which were designed and
          empirically shown not to cross hybridize to human
          transcripts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . While the all DAP condition resulted
          in an increase in the hybridization intensity for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          of the negative control probes, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A condition
          produced lower background signals similar to those of the
          unmodified control (data not shown). Thus, increases in
          hybridization signal intensities in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A
          condition are attributable to specific modified cRNA
          target/DNA probe interactions. We conclude that partial
          substitution of adenosine with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> does not significantly
          compromise specificity and was, therefore, investigated
          further.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> incorporation on differential
          expression ratios
          Ultimately, the goal of any global expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> system measuring relative transcript abundance
          is to accurately and reproducibly determine the changes
          in expression levels between different target samples. We
          therefore determined if the increases in signal intensity
          caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> incorporation had an effect on differential
          ratio calls. Kidney and lymphoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cRNA samples</ENAMEX> containing
          either no modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A were hybridized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">duplicate to Human Uniset</ENAMEX> I arrays; average kidney to
          lymphoma ratios were calculated and plotted (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
          after removing signal outliers defined as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold
          difference between replicates. Differential expression
          ratios demonstrate very good correlation between the
          unmodified control sample and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A sample (r =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.95</NUMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Uniset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> microarray.
          In addition to investigating the correlation of the
          differential expression ratios generated from modified
          and unmodified targets, we determined whether DAP
          incorporation affected the variability of the ratio
          calls. One method to measure microarray reproducibility
          is by calculating the coefficients of variation (CVs) for
          each replicate probe across arrays. Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> can
          also be calculated for multiple ratio calculations across
          different tissue samples. Figure 6shows a plot of the CVs
          of the ratios as a function of the mean ratios for all of
          the data points, 
          regardless of the intensity level of
          the probe . Consistent with earlier findings [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ,
          the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> in the of the kidney to lymphoma
          ratios are below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>, with an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.2%</NUMEX>, and the
          variability increases as the ratio approaches unity for
          the unmodified targets (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6Bshows</TIMEX> that
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A condition produces ratios with similar
          overall variability (average CV of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.4%</NUMEX>) compared to the
          unmodified control targets. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> in the ratios
          generated using either the control or partially modified
          cRNA are binned according to the magnitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>, the
          partially modified cRNA generates more CVs in the less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> bins (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6C</NUMEX>). These data demonstrate that
          the low variability in ratio calls that we are able to
          routinely obtain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] are maintained during DAP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX>. However, a closer inspection of the ratios
          in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6Aand 6Breveals</TIMEX> that a possible caveat of DAP
          use is a slight compression of ratios along the entire
          range of calls. This compression is also observed when
          the observed ratio is binned according to the magnitude
          of the fold change (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6D</NUMEX>). The partially modified
          cRNA generates more ratios in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> fold change
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bin</ENAMEX> and fewer ratio changes in the other bins. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compression</ENAMEX> is not significant but also manifests itself
          in the slope of the correlation line in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The
          slope of this line was found to be greater than
          unity.
          The differential expression ratios calculated when
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5and 6</NUMEX>) suggest that incorporation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> has little effect on correlation and reproducibility
          of ratio calls between tissues. However, the ability to
          accurately discriminate between signals due to true
          hybridization events and what may be considered
          background noise is paramount to making accurate
          differential assessments. A lower limit of detection was
          previously defined using our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> by developing a
          negative control threshold in order to assign a
          confidence level to such signal or noise queries [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Briefly, this threshold was determined by taking the mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> of bacterial negative control probes mentioned
          above (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">minus</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> trim to account for weak cross
          hybridization of high expressers or for true
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to sequences not in the database) and
          adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> standard deviations (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.7%</NUMEX> confidence).
          Using only probes that were at or above the negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> threshold in both tissues, we observed a
          significantly greater number of probes in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A
          sample for which we could confidently assign a ratio
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). As Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7shows</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing DAP
          generated over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> more above-threshold ratios than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing only unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX>. Most of
          these ratios identified only in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A sample were
          small in magnitude, with fold changes between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> and
          1.9.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The effect of modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> on hybridization
          intensities
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> important issues for identifying differentially
          expressed genes using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) methods to
          increase signal intensity and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the ability to
          accurately separate true hybridization signals from
          background noise at the low end of the signal dynamic
          range. In this study, we utilized modified nucleoside
          triphosphates with the aim of enhancing hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity across a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences.
          Modified ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside analogs have been
          used in a variety of applications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] , but
          their use has been limited in the field of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarrays</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] . We demonstrate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-aminoadenosine or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,6</NUMEX>-diaminopurine (DAP), an analog of adenosine,
          significantly increases signal intensity for a wide range
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-5</ENAMEX> methylated pyrimidine
          analogs of cytosine and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">uridine</ENAMEX> decreased signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> across the entire range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences on
          our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Although incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> did not uniformly
          increase the hybridization stability for all target-probe
          duplexes, even moderate incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX> DAP:A)
          resulted in signal intensity increases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 30-fold</NUMEX>)
          for the majority of probes on our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>. More
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, a significant number of probes that went
          previously undetected (i.e., below a negative control
          threshold; [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ) in the control sample exhibited signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX> above this threshold in DAP-modified samples.
          Utilization of such a modification may prove especially
          valuable for low abundant transcripts which may be
          difficult to quantify because of weak hybridization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Band 2C</TIMEX>, the largest
          increases in signal intensities occurred for low and
          medium expressers relative to the unmodified control
          sample. It is apparent that the effect of DAP depends not
          only on the sequence compositions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>,
          but also on the absolute abundance of specific
          transcripts in the target sample.
          It is of interest to note that the results we report
          here differ from those obtained by others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Those
          studies reported increases in signal intensity for
          targets containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl UTP</ENAMEX> while completely
          substituted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DAP</ENAMEX> had the opposite or no
          effect. Although we cannot completely account for the
          disparity of the results, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key difference in
          methodology between the studies is that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
          not able to normalize concentrations for modified and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmodified ATP</ENAMEX> targets because of dramatic differences in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cRNA</ENAMEX> yield. Therefore, mass input of cRNA target samples
          were much greater for unmodified samples compared to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DAP-containing samples</ENAMEX>. Because the sample preparation
          used in this protocol is highly robust and reproducible [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] , we were able to use equivalent mass inputs of all
          modified and unmodified targets during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hybridization</TIMEX>,
          allowing us to present our results quantitatively rather
          than qualitatively. However, we agree that complete
          substitution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> for adenosine may cause specificity
          to decline in certain sequence contexts, which may limit
          its usefulness in microarray applications. However, we
          have found that reducing the proportion of DAP
          incorporated into target samples (e.g., incorporating a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio of DAP:adenosine) is one approach to avoid such
          decreases in specificity. Other factors that may
          contribute to the dissimilarity of the results include
          differences in probe sequence and size, microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fabrication/chemistries, labeling/detection</ENAMEX> methods, and
          the vigorous mixing that is employed in our microarray
          experiments. We have previously shown the dramatic impact
          of mixing on hybridization signal intensities [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Presumably, this impact is due to the effect of three
          dimensional diffusion of the target molecules and to the
          effect on how many probes reach equilibrium in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. It is possible that the degree of mixing
          during the hybridization can affect the number of probes
          which show a difference in intensity with substitution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> for adenosine as well as the magnitude of this
          difference. Given these differences, it is not surprising
          that our results are not in line with those previously
          reported.
          The results in our study are in good agreement with
          previous reports which include a wide variety of
          interaction types, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> interactions. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 25</NUMEX> ] . These studies
          have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> substitution in oligonucleotide
          probes can increase thermodynamic affinities as reported
          directly by increases in T 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and indirectly through increases in
          hybridization intensities.
        
        
          Biophysical considerations in using modified
          NTPs
          Modified nucleotides appear to drive the equilibrium
          (particularly for low copy transcripts binding with their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">targets</ENAMEX>) towards <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> formation. These findings suggest
          that DAP use could be exploited in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> that are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>, such as tumor biopsies. Based on our experiments
          with extended hybridization times (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), use of DAP
          may prove to be a useful alternative to increase array
          sensitivity for studies that are unable to generate
          enough target to hybridize or are unable to increase
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hybridization</NUMEX> times because of throughput
          constraints.
          Why do we see differential effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MeC</ENAMEX>, and
          MeU on hybridization intensities? The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> was
          able to increase hybridization intensities while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">MeU</ENAMEX> decreased hybridization intensities (Figures 2Dand
          2E) is interesting in light of the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> is a
          purine incorporated into an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA strand</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> and MeU
          are pyrimidines incorporated into an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA strand</ENAMEX>. Many
          studies have shown that a ribopurine rich strand bound to
          a deoxypyrimidine rich strand has a higher stability than
          the corresponding all deoxy strands which, in turn, have
          a higher stability than a deoxypurine rich strand bound
          to a ribopyrimidine rich strand [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . These
          differences also suggest that further studies examining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> or MeC incorporation into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand cDNA, followed
          by formation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX>, may not necessarily
          show the same effects as incorporation of these modified
          nucleotides into cRNA. Finally, earlier studies have
          noted that methylation of cytosines (generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX>) in
          ribopolynucleotides stabilizes duplexes to the same
          extent as substitution of thymine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX>) for uracil [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
          . Thus, although it is still surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> and MeU
          decrease hybridization intensities, it is not surprising
          that the magnitude of the effects generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeC</ENAMEX> and
          MeU <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are similar.
          Could the differential effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> versus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MeC</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MeU</ENAMEX> or the differential effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> on different probe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> also be related to structural consequences?
          Earlier studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragments,
          can widen the minor groove, as detected by reactivity
          towards uranyl nitrate or susceptibility to Dnase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , and can relieve compressions in the
          minor groove associated with A-tracts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . In
          contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> and molecular modeling studies of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MeC</ENAMEX> have demonstrated
          that, while this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> still has a B-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA conformation</ENAMEX>,
          there are differences in the structural parameters and
          thermal stability relative to the unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          ] . An earlier study also found, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> closely related
          octanucleotide duplexes, that although the methylated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplexes</ENAMEX> retained their B-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA conformation</ENAMEX>, different
          structural and thermal stability effects were seen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          . Although these studies have been carried out with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-DNA</ENAMEX> and not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-RNA duplexes</ENAMEX>, it is possible that MeC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> may have different structural consequences
          than DAP substitution.
          We have shown that while complete substitution of DAP
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> may cause decreased base mismatch discrimination
          in certain sequence contexts, equimolar ratios of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenosine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> in cRNA target samples did not have
          significant detrimental effects on specificity (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, in one sequence context, the DAP
          modification enhanced specificity against mismatches.
          Enhanced specificity against mismatches has also been
          observed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> is incorporated into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligomers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and after C5-(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-propynyl</ENAMEX>)ation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrimidines</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-RNA duplexes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          The effect of modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTPs</ENAMEX> on differential
          expression ratios
          The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> to increase hybridization signals is
          supported by the results that show equivalency of both
          ratio calls and ratio variability in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> DAP:A and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5and 6</NUMEX>). When all data points
          are considered in the differential expression ratio
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, the two methods appear equivalent. However,
          when only those data points which are above a threshold
          value [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] are used, ensuring a higher confidence that
          these intensities represent true expression levels and
          not noise or weak cross hybridization, the DAP-modified
          cRNA enabled an ~ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> increase in the number of ratios
          that could be generated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Such increases are
          critical in order to sample as many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as possible in
          any given microarray experiment. For example, some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have analyzed only data for which the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity is greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 0.4%</NUMEX> of
          the total signal range in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Although
          this method minimizes the variance associated with the
          ratios, many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their expression changes are
          missed. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> use a minimal intensity level to
          determine whether a gene is present or absent, prior to
          including this gene in expression analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . It is
          plausible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAP</ENAMEX> modification, by increasing intensity
          levels, particularly for low expressors, could enable
          wider coverage in genome-wide expression analyses.
          In summary, incorporation of modified nucleotides may
          not only lead to discovery and better quantitation of
          rare expressers in complex samples but also impact other
          aspects of the microarray experiment such as probe design
          prior to array fabrication and the statistical design of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments. The target preparation procedure
          (generation of amplified cRNA or of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand cDNA)
          and the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> formation may dictate the
          choice of which modified nucleotide to use, as we and
          others have found differential effects with various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>. We believe further investigation in this
          area could be fruitful.

          following gradient was used: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0-1%</NUMEX> Solvent B (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcCN</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Solvent A1</ENAMEX>) over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solvent B</ENAMEX> over the next
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-45%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solvent B</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next 30 minutes</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45-100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solvent B</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next 20 minutes</TIMEX>, and hold at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> B for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 minutes</TIMEX>. The concentration of the
          heterocycles was determined by the absorbance values at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">260 nm</TIMEX> (the wavelength where maximal absorption occurs
          for the heterocycles) and the biotin-containing
          nucleoside concentrations were determined by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorbance</ENAMEX> values at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">294 nm</NUMEX> (the wavelength where maximal
          absorption occurs for biotinylated cytosine and
          biotinylated uridine). The biotin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-UTP peak was
          measured at an absorbance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">294</NUMEX> nm with the extinction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M -1cm -1</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> was
          measured at an absorbance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm with the extinction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9894</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M -1cm -1</ENAMEX>.
