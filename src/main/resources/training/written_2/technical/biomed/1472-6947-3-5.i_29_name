        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tissue Microarrays</ENAMEX> (TMAs), first introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, are
        collections of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of tissue cores arrayed into a
        single paraffin histology block [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> can
        be sectioned and mounted onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides, producing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly</NUMEX>-identical slides. TMAs permit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to use a single slide to conduct controlled
        studies on large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of tissues, using a small amount
        of reagent. The source of tissue is only restricted by its
        availability in paraffin and ranges from cores of embedded
        cultured cells to tissues from any higher <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. In a
        typical TMA study, every TMA core is associated with a rich
        variety of data elements (image, tissue diagnosis, patient
        demographics or other biomaterial description, quantified
        experimental results). Under ideal circumstances, a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraffin</ENAMEX> TMA block can be sectioned into nearly identical
        glass slides dispensed to many different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> may use different experimental
        protocols. They may capture data using different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX>, different databases, different data
        architectures, different data elements and immensely
        different formats. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> could vastly increase
        the value of their experimental findings if they could
        merge their findings with those of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>
        that used the same TMA block. Unfortunately, the practice
        of merging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data sets obtained at different laboratories
        using different information systems is infrequently
        practiced. A key barrier to this process is the
        incompatibility of the individual data sets. There simply
        is no specification for exchanging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data. Without such a
        specification, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data files can not be shared or merged,
        and the full scientific value of this new technology is not
        realized.
        The need for a data exchange standards is not unique to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> experiments. The same issues have challenged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>
        who use another array technology, gene expression arrays.
        The history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIAME</ENAMEX> (minimum information about a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microarray</ENAMEX> experiment) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGED</ENAMEX> (microarray gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> has been described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> was
        chosen as the formatting language for the effort to
        standardize gene expression data. The purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> is to
        eliminate barriers to data exchange and permit the
        integration of data from heterogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Consequently, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> specification in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> would provide
        another level of biomedical data integration in which array
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> of many different types can be combined and
        analyzed.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> has emerged as the document
        format used in almost all new data standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> achieves
        its functionality through the use of metadata. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metadata</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that describes things, including data elements. In XML
        documents, most metadata is marked by enclosing sets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">angle brackets:</ENAMEX>
        <birthdate><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2003</TIMEX></birthdate>
        In this example, birthdate is the metadata that
        describes and flanks "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan 1, 2003</TIMEX>". Besides providing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metadata</ENAMEX> to describe the data elements contained in the XML
        file, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> files can be self-described by metadata.
        Self-description is a simple but powerful concept. If a
        file describes itself (its subject, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>, its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">semantics</ENAMEX> and all its data elements), it can exist as a
        completely independent data object unassociated with any
        software applications or database instrument. There is an
        abundance of freely available software implementations,
        written in a variety of open source programming languages,
        that permit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to validate and parse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> data files [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The metadata in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> files can be formalized as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-defined</ENAMEX> common data elements whose definition and
        usage semantics are explicitly described in an accessible,
        unique document. Most efforts that create an XML
        specification for data domains (such as gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>), will also produce a formal document for the metadata
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> tags) included in the specification. Anyone wishing to
        implement the specification would need to understand the
        metadata definitions and refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">metadata</ENAMEX> definition
        document from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> data files. The standard guidelines
        for creating metadata specifications is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ISO-11179</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        .

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association for Pathology Informatics</ENAMEX> (API) is an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> whose mission is to promote the field of
          pathology informatics as an academic and a clinical
          subspecialty of pathology. Further information on the API

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Standards Committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">API</ENAMEX>,
          recognizing the importance of TMA technology to pathology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX>, organized a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> workshop to discuss the
          subject of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data exchange specification. A
          sponsorship listing is contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The complete
          listing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA Data exchange</ENAMEX> workshops is found in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> discussion was held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 30, 2001</TIMEX>
          at the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automated Information Management</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
          Laboratory" meeting, held at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan</ENAMEX>
          and organized by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Friedman</ENAMEX>. The complete listing
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA Data exchange</ENAMEX> workshops is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          Workshop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX> endorsed an effort by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards Committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">API</ENAMEX>, to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data
          exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specification</ENAMEX>. Consensus was reached on the
          following guiding principles, and has been documented in
          a [public domain] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workshop</ENAMEX> summary, available at:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://65.222.228.150/jjb/tmasum.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The standard should be free and
          non-proprietary.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The standard should be self-descriptive. Anyone
          reviewing a TMA file should be able to precisely
          determine how the data is organized by reading the data
          tags included in the file.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The standard should, when feasible, use publicly
          available common data elements linked to a web site that
          fully defines each common data element included in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX> (needed to support dataset-independent
          distributed network queries). This means that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> that creates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> standard must work with
          other standards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> to ensure cross-database
          compatibility of common data elements
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The standard should be generic (able to describe
          any laboratory's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data structure)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The standard should be extensible. This means that
          there will need to be a standards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> that can make
          changes in the standard over time and that can keep a
          documented history of modifications in the standard.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The standard should be easy to implement. It should
          be relatively easy for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmer</ENAMEX> to translate any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commercial TMA</ENAMEX> dataset into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> standard (and to
          reverse the process)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The standard should not be a requirement. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> that creates the standard should take no
          measure to require <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> to implement the
          standard. Those using the standard would be able to
          choose that data that is included in their shared
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX> (e.g. they may choose to withold or encrypt
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient identifiers</ENAMEX>)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. The standard should have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> buy-in.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX>, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, pathology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and other standards
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> should all have the opportunity to comment on
          the standards.
          Subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">workshops</ENAMEX> affirmed the guidelines
          established in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> conference, but plans to develop
          a formal standard (approved by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards Organization</ENAMEX>)
          were abandoned in favor of developing a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>-supported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> specification. The specification
          would conform to pre-existing standards for creating XML
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vocabularies</ENAMEX> and well-formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> documents. This strategy
          would produce a new specification as a standard metadata
          document [see Discussion]. The current draft
          specification complies with guidelines formulated during
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> workshop, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data structure
          conform with all subsequent recommendations from workshop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The workshops themselves were composed of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from academia, industry and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were present at each workshop.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          The data structure
          Every TMA file is an XML file that is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          sections
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A header section, with data elements that provides
          basic information about the file (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>, date created,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>). The header elements are taken directly from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dublin Core</ENAMEX>, a set of specification <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> throughout the world to index electronic
          information files <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://dublincore.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. A block section, with data elements that describe
          the TMA block (how many cores, how large are cores, how
          are the cores arrayed in the block, etc.)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. A slide section, with data elements that describe
          the slides prepared from the TMA block (how are the
          slides stored, how are they identified, etc)
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. A core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> with data elements that describe
          each of the cores in the TMA block (what case did the
          core come from, what block from the case was used to make
          the core, what drill-site in the block was used, what was
          the diagnosis of the drill-site, what clinical history is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the core, what demographic information is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from whom the core was taken,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>). This section is by far the longest section, with
          well-annotated data for every core in the TMA array.
        
        
          The data elements
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Data Elements</ENAMEX> (CDEs) are well-defined XML
          metadata tags that can be used to consistenly describe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> files. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX> were created to
          describe the kinds of data contained in a TMA file. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> elements are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Each data element is
          fully described as a set of features conforming to the
          ISO-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11179</NUMEX> standard for meta-data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The CDE
          descriptor file is included as an attachment to this

          separated by underscores.
          This approach gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> enormous
          flexibility while still providing a rich set of metadata
          and a uniform data structure.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The semantics of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data exchange file can
          be entirely specified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> semantic rules that can be
          understood by non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> of the specification can add tags of their
          own creation and can even add arguments to the list of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> are free to add any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> constructs they wish
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTDs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schemas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Entities</ENAMEX>, non-parsed data, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDF</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">references</ENAMEX>, attributes, etc.). Namespace prefixes are
          allowed.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA CDEs</ENAMEX> (XML tags) required in every TMA
          document are histo, header, tma, block, slide, and core.
          There are no data inclusion requirements, so a valid TMA
          file may consist exclusively of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> tags.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> semantic rules are easy to model in
          validating software implementations. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> script
          (tmavalid.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pl</ENAMEX>) for validating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data exchange files is
          included as a supplemental attachment with this
          publication.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> semantic rules provide enough data
          structure and metadata to for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to design
          understandable and parsable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> documents.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> semantic rules and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX> can be referred
          to from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URIs</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> documents, so that TMA
          documents can be self-descriptive.
        
        
          Examples of valid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data exchange files
          
            Example1.xml
            <histo>
            <tma>
            <header>
            </header>
            <block>
            <slide>
            </slide>
            <core>
            </core>
            </block>
            </tma>
            </histo>
            The specification does not require that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> tags
            actually enclose data. Example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, consisting only of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tags</ENAMEX>, is a well-formed TMA file. Only the minimal
            required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX>, are contained: histo, header, tma,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX>, slide and core. Note that 'histo' is the root
            element. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tma</ENAMEX> file nests under histo. A single TMA
            file may include several tma tags, allowing a
            collection of many different TMA data sets in a single
            document. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'header'</ENAMEX> section nests under 'tma'.
            Typically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'header'</ENAMEX> section will contain the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>
            Core elements. The header section, when populated by
            all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> Core header elements, will permit
            indexing services, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>, and anyone
            examining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> document, to easily determine the
            basic identifying information about the file (who made
            the file, what is the file, when was the file made,
            where was it made, etc).
          
          
            Example2.xml
            <histo>
            <my_own_tag>
            </my_own_tag>
            <tma>
            <header>
            <font>
            </font>
            </header>
            <block>
            <slide>
            </slide>
            <core>
            <secret-tag>
            </secret-tag>
            </core>
            <core name="liver">
            </core>
            <slide>
            </slide>
            </block>
            </tma>
            </histo>
            Example 2 is also valid. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that several of the
            tags do not match <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. This is
            permitted. Also, an attribute was added for 'core' a
            required TMA element. The attribute is not part of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> specification. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> validator ignores elements
            and attributes added by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Example3.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xml</ENAMEX> (invalid structure)

            </HISTO>
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Example 3</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> errors. The 'HISTO'
            element is in uppercase. As in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX>, elements tags
            are case sensitive, and the root element, histo, must
            appear as lowercase. Additionally, the 'header' element
            is nested under the block element. There are very few
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nesting</ENAMEX> rules in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> specification, but the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX> requires a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> for header
            and for block. The 'header' tag must be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> TMA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDE</ENAMEX> following the 'tma' tag. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> may add their own
            tags that precede the 'header' tag after the 'tma' tag.
            Non-CDE tags are tags that are not included in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>,
            and are simply ignored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> validator. The block
            element may contain only block, slide and core
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Example4.xml
            Example <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> illustrates use of the self-describing
            nesting hierarchy of CDEs taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. In this
            example, values for several of the tags are added.

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Exchange Specifications</ENAMEX> are written so that
        databases related to a specific data domain may be designed
        with common data and common data structures. Standards are
        now available for creating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> documents [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data exchange</ENAMEX> specifications that conform to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CDE</ENAMEX> standards and receive support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> community
        become powerful research devices. The availability of large
        numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> files conforming to the data exchange
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX> will permit the inter-laboratory comparison
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data and the integration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data with data from
        other biological databases. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> will be able to
        submit their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data as supplemental files with their
        research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can
        examine the original research data. Because the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX> provides a way to produce a self-describing
        file, it would be a simple matter to port the data from TMA
        files into virtually any commercial or open source
        database.
        Specifications are only adopted when they fill the needs
        of a heterogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user community</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> includes: pathologists, research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>,
        informaticians, commercial tissue repositories, and journal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>. In order to develop a set of standards that will
        appeal to all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA Data Exchange</ENAMEX>
        specification was developed in a series of open workshops.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> was that advances in TMA
        technology would be stifled by a rigid standard containing
        a list of required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Data Elements</ENAMEX> and a required data
        structure. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        who were using proprietary database implementations. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> wanted the freedom to add [proprietary] data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA exchange</ENAMEX> documents without violating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX>. They also indicated that they required a
        loose data structure that could be easily re-constructed
        from their own databases.
        The most common way of specifying properties of an XML
        document is through a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Type Definition</ENAMEX>) or a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schema</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . In fact, the workshops considered several
        versions of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTD</ENAMEX> without obtaining approval at any of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workshops</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s emphasis on flexibility and open
        design of the specification, particularly the requirement
        that users be allowed to add their own tags, made writing a
        DTD difficult. The spectrum of workshop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, which
        included pathologists, imaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, and tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX>,
        was not particularly focused on the technicalities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XML</ENAMEX>.
        We fully expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> will eventually move toward a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTD</ENAMEX> or schema to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> specification.
        The current draft of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA Data Exchange</ENAMEX> specification
        satisfies user requests for maximum flexibility. With
        freedom comes responsibility. It is quite possible to
        design a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data file that conforms to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data
        exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specification</ENAMEX> but lacks annotational detail. Of
        the eighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA CDEs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> are required. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> that lacks detailed identifying information for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>,
        slides, cores and images may pass inspection by the
        validator, but it would be of little scientific value.
        Similarly, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> that lacks a full set of header
        information (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Title</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creator</ENAMEX>, Subject and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keywords</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Description</ENAMEX>, etc.) cannot be sensibly indexed or shared.
        Depending on comments from implementers, the specification
        may need to expand the number of required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEs</ENAMEX>.
        Those who wish to use the specification will need short
        programs that map their pre-existing database elements over
        to the equivalent data elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA Data Exchange</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX>. The programs will need to adhere to the
        general XML structure described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. For elements
        with no corresponding listing in the specification,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> will be expected to create their own metadata
        tags for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> files. It is hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> files will
        soon be available to the public as supplemental attachments
        to journal submissions. This means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> will
        need to exclude identifying information from shared TMA
        files. These considerations place additional burdens on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA Data Exchange Specification</ENAMEX> provides
        software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> with a promising new area for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data exchange specification is now available in
        a draft form with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-approved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Data Elements</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-approved general file format and structure.
        The specification can be freely used by the scientific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. It is designed to be independent of the source
        of the data, including the source of the tissue, the
        experimental protocol, the imaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">modality</ENAMEX>, the data
        capture method, and the schema for internal storage. The
        metadata file of fully described <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA CDEs</ENAMEX> (tma_cde.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX>) and
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> implementation of the validator (validtma.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pl</ENAMEX>) are
        attached as supplemental files with this article. Efforts
        sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association for Pathology Informatics</ENAMEX> to
        establish a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMA</ENAMEX> data exchange specification are expected to
        continue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several more years</TIMEX>. The interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is
        invited to participate in these efforts.
