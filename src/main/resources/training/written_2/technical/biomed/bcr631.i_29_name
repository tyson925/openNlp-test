        Common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> currently used in treating metastatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> are the antimitotics paclitaxel and docetaxel
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> bind to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-tubulin</NUMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
        mitotic spindles, and halt cell division at metaphase.
        Their effectiveness in cancer chemotherapy is thought to be
        due to their ability to reduce the dynamics of microtubules
        in mitotic spindles, thus preventing spindle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and
        interrupting the normal movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids
        toward the spindle poles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Tubulin, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
        kDa Î±Î² heterodimer, is structurally heterogeneous, with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding</ENAMEX> Î±-tubulin and Î²-tubulin isotypes. The
        major differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isotype</ENAMEX> classes reside in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last 15-20</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carboxy-termini</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] ,
        and these differences have been exploited in the
        development of isotype-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">microtubules</ENAMEX> are formed from a mixture of
        Î±-tubulin and Î²-tubulin isotype <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15 16</NUMEX> ] , and
        the antimitotics used in chemotherapy interact primarily
        with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-tubulin</NUMEX>. In vertebrates the concentrations of the
        specific isotypes vary in different tissues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 17</NUMEX> ] ,
        although the functional role for the variability in tubulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptides</ENAMEX> is uncertain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        The expression of genes encoding Î±-tubulin and Î²-tubulin
        seems to be developmentally regulated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . For example,
        tubulin isotype expression patterns change during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and maturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 20</NUMEX> ] . Studies
        with paclitaxel or other antimitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colchicine</ENAMEX> or estramustine, indicate that drug interactions
        with tubulin isotypes differ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] and might
        contribute to cell resistance to antimitotics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of antimitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, the
        vinca alkaloids, was shown to bind with similar affinity to
        all tubulin isotypes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that alterations
        in drug binding affinity is unlikely to be the cause of
        drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, whereas some of these data
        suggest a role for tubulin isotypes in drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>,
        cell growth, and differentiation, other work indicates that
        isotype-independent factors affecting micro-tubule polymer
        formation are more important than changes in isotype levels
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . For example, a decrease in total polymer
        concentrations causes resistance to microtubule-stabilizing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paclitaxel</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] .
        The work presented here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quantitatively</TIMEX> compares the
        tubulin isotype levels in normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor breast tissues</ENAMEX>.
        We developed an indirect, competitive enzyme-linked
        immunosorbent assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>) using antibodies specific for
        Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> that is sensitive to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml tubulin.</ENAMEX> The results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> agree with
        quantitative Western blotting and indicate that Î²-tubulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">class II</ENAMEX> predominates in both normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor breast</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isotype</ENAMEX> levels are similar in both tissues, but
        surprisingly they exhibit a broad fractional distribution.
        To explore this further we measured <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu protein</ENAMEX>
        levels, which are known to be correlated with poor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX>. We demonstrate that although Her2/neu levels in
        tumor tissues were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-30</NUMEX>-fold those in normal tissues, there
        was no correlation between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Her2</NUMEX>/neu biomarker and
        tubulin isotype levels. Taken together, these data suggest
        that, unlike previous reports on small cell lung cancer [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] , Î²-tubulin isotype levels are not diagnostic markers
        in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. These results challenge the hypothesis of
        a universal role for tubulin isotypes in tumor growth and
        the development of drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, we cannot
        exclude the possibility that changes in the distribution of
        tubulin isotypes in normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor breast tissue</ENAMEX>, in
        conjunction with other molecular factors, might still be
        relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression and cellular response to
        antimitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.

          Purification of tubulin from pig brain
          Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin (PC-tubulin) free of
          microtubule-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPs</ENAMEX>) was obtained by
          warm/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold polymerization</ENAMEX>/depolymerization with the
          addition of a final phosphocellulose chromatography step
          to separate tubulin from MAPs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . Tubulin
          concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically,

          Cell culture and <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu ELISAs</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCF-7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCC1954</ENAMEX> were
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX> and grown
          under the recommended conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCF-7 cells</ENAMEX> are known
          to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than five</NUMEX> copies of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Her2</NUMEX>/neu gene,
          whereas HCC1954 cells overexpress the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> because of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene amplification</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . Her2/neu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels
          were determined with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu ELISA</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oncogene</ENAMEX>) in
          accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> kit was also used to determine <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu protein</ENAMEX>
          levels in tissue samples.
        
        
          Tissue preparation and tubulin fractionation
          Anonymous paired tumor ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) and normal ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) breast tissue samples
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> of surgery, were provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative Human</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissue Network</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHTN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Pathology reports were provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHTN</ENAMEX> for each
          tissue sample. Only primary tumor samples were examined.
          Normal tissue was taken from the same breast at a site
          distant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and evaluated for the presence of
          tumor cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the study, ages ranging from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 to 92 years</TIMEX>, had not received prior radiation or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapy</ENAMEX>. The diagnosis of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Tissue samples were homogenized in a Dounce
          homogenizer on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of lysis buffer (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 mM MES</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protease Inhibitor Tablets; Boehringer Mannheim</ENAMEX>]).
          Membranes were removed by pelleting at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>-centrifuge for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">min.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Membrane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipids</ENAMEX> remained at
          the top of the sample and a tiny pellet was often also
          observed. The pellet was not sufficiently large to allow
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels with our assay. The
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration in the supernatant (separated
          from the lipid fraction) was determined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Protein Assay Reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytoskeleton Inc</ENAMEX>). The supernatant
          was then loaded on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml arginine-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sepharose</ENAMEX> column
          equilibrated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MES</ENAMEX> buffer above without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
          X-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. The procedure for arginine-Sepharose purification
          of tubulin was presented in detail by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lacey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snowdon</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . An enriched tubulin fraction was collected in
          high-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt MES</ENAMEX> buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulphate</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equilibrated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pipes</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM MgSO
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> mM GDP, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>,
          using a spun column. The tubulin fractions were used in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> and/or Western blotting experiments. The same
          procedure was used to fractionate pig brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to
          quantify tubulin isotypes by Western blotting.
          To ensure that arginine-Sepharose chromatography did
          not preferentially fractionate specific tubulin isotypes,
          microtubule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein fractions</ENAMEX> from an early stage in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tubulin</NUMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPs</ENAMEX>) were examined by ELISAs
          and Western blotting. There were no differences before
          and after arginine-Sepharose fractionation in the
          percentages of any of the Î²-tubulin isotypes tested in
          this study (data not shown).
        
        
          Quantitative Western blotting
          The monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used in the studies, TUJ1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Î²</ENAMEX>-tubulin class III), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7H12</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Î²</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes
          I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7B9</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Î²</ENAMEX>-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>), have been
          characterized previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] and are highly
          specific for their epitopes. Sequential immunoaffinity
          columns were used to purify Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and III
          with their associated Î±-tubulins as described previously
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Known amounts of PC-tubulin, Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and pig brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) from the cerebellum and
          right cerebrum were examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">polyacrylamide</NUMEX>-gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PVDF</ENAMEX> filters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          Alkaline phosphatase colorimetric reactions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBT</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCIP</ENAMEX>) were used to identify tubulin isotypes. Triplicate
          blots for each sample were analyzed by densitometry
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ImageQuant Software</ENAMEX>). The
          linearity of response was established by systematically
          varying the amounts of known tubulin loaded into wells
          and plotting these values against densitometry results by
          using Origin <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microcal</ENAMEX>). These comparisons allowed us
          to calibrate the amounts of Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> in PC-tubulin and in pig brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          The same procedures were used to quantify Î²-tubulin in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> tumor and normal breast tissues for comparison with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> results.
        
        
          Tubulin isotype ELISAs
          Indirect, competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ELISAs</ENAMEX> were used to quantify the
          tubulin isotypes in tissue samples. The method is adapted
          from standard protocols for indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . The
          indirect ELISA involves the titration of antibodies
          reacted with tubulin in solution. A known amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubulin</ENAMEX> is mixed with the unknown sample; the antibodies
          compete with a known amount of tubulin bound to the
          plate. A secondary antibody generates the signal used to
          quantify the unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The amount of known protein
          can be adjusted to optimize the sensitivity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>.
          Optimal tubulin binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">75 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> per well) to

          determined as described above; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were used to

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. Duplicate standard curves for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat dried milk</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>). Duplicate unknown tissue
          samples were prepared by combining them with known levels
          of PC-tubulin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 : 1</ENAMEX>), then mixing them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> with

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antibodies</ENAMEX> (usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml) against Î²-tubulin
          classes I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7H12</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II (7B9</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TUJ1</NUMEX>) were used
          at optimal dilutions (ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 : 500 to 1 :</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10000</ENAMEX>)
          determined empirically for each new stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          Serial dilutions (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> per well) were performed, varying
          only the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration and keeping the antibody
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat dried milk</ENAMEX> concentrations constant. Plates
          were left at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> under mild humidity for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shaker</ENAMEX> and then washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and blotted
          dry before addition of the secondary horseradish
          peroxidase-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat</ENAMEX> dried
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. Secondary antibody concentrations were
          optimized for each new stock. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22Â°C</NUMEX> on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shaker</ENAMEX>, plates were washed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, blotted
          dry and reacted with tetramethylbenzidine (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> per
          well). The reaction was stopped with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfuric acid</ENAMEX>,
          and plates were read at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> nm in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate reader
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TECAN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Triangle Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were fitted by nonlinear <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least</NUMEX> squares, using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitall</ENAMEX> (MTR software, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>) modified with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">exponential</ENAMEX> fitting function. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fitter</ENAMEX> globally fits
          the standard curve and the sample data to extract the
          amplitude, the exponential curvature, and the amount of
          tubulin isotype in the breast tissue sample. Typical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> data are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In developing the
          quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tubulin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX>, either microtubule protein
          from pig brain containing unknown amounts of tubulin or a
          known amount of PC-tubulin was used as the experimental
          sample. This permitted a determination of the accuracy of
          our quantification. The experiments with microtubule
          protein resulted in isotype percentages similar to those
          determined by quantitative Western blotting. Isotype
          determinations with the experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> made with
          known PC-tubulin were, within error, the same as the
          expected quantities (data not shown).
          The reliability of the tubulin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> is indicated by
          comparison with quantitative Western blotting of breast
          tissue samples (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 3</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> paired anonymous
          normal and anonymous tumor samples were obtained in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-2 g</TIMEX>
          quantities sufficient for quantitative Western blotting
          (kindly provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Terry Hall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mississippi Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>). There
          is no significant difference between normal and tumor
          tissue distributions of tubulin isotypes. However,
          Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> fractions vary widely:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.23</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX>, respectively. Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tubulin</ENAMEX> class
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> values are relatively constant, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> (with the
          exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.09 and 0.11</NUMEX> for tumor [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T4</TIMEX>] and
          normal [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N4</TIMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These wide distributions for
          Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> agree with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISAs</ENAMEX> for
          the larger study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> additional samples from CHTN
          presented here (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.41</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.76</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.46</NUMEX>, respectively).
          Note also that, unlike for breast tissues, quantitative
          Western blot analyses of pig brain samples demonstrate
          relatively constant tubulin isotype fractions described
          above (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The values for each isotype in pig brain
          are in reasonable agreement with the values previously
          reported (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> for Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , further establishing the validity
          of this approach. This result supports the accuracy and
          the sensitivity of the quantitative Western blots and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISAs</ENAMEX> and demonstrates that the wide distribution
          observed for Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> in breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> is not due to error in measurement.
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry
          Tissues were fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> buffered formalin containing
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc sulfate</ENAMEX> to preserve antigenic sites, then
          embedded in paraffin, and sectioned on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiss</ENAMEX> rotary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microtome</ENAMEX>. Trypsin digestion was performed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> and followed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wash</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybean</ENAMEX> trypsin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. The slides were de-paraffinized with a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> incubations in xylene, rehydrated through a
          graded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> series beginning with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>, and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were blocked in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skimmed milk</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>) and incubated overnight in a humid chamber
          at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> with primary monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. The slides
          were washed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and incubated with
          a working dilution of biotin-labeled anti-mouse secondary

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> was developed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 mM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX>'-diaminobenzidine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were counterstained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill</ENAMEX>'s hematoxylin,
          dehydrated, and mounted. Negative controls were performed
          by omission of the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, and positive
          controls for tubulin isotypes were performed with pig
          brain tissues.
        
        
          Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real-time PCR</ENAMEX> was used to determine tubulin isotype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels in selected breast tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T1, N1,</ENAMEX>
          T4, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">N4, T12, N12, T13, N13, T15, N15, T18, N18, N6, and</ENAMEX>
          T14). All the other breast tissue samples were required
          in their entirety for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> and immunohistochemistry
          experiments. The purpose of these real-time PCR
          experiments was to establish whether tubulin protein
          levels were correlated with mRNA levels. We developed
          protocols for quantitative two-step reverse transcriptase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> to establish the relative amounts of mRNA transcripts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoding</ENAMEX> each of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-tubulin isotypes</NUMEX> (classes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>). Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6cells with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro-to-Midiâ„</ENAMEX>¢ Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purification System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>). The purity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          was assessed by 
          A 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">260 :</TIMEX> 
          A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> ratios. Electrophoresis with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LabChipsâ„¢</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer</ENAMEX> was used
          to determine the integrity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          concentration was calculated from 
          A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> absorbance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) or
          obtained directly from the bioanalyzer. Before the
          reverse transcription reaction, genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> contamination
          was eliminated by digestion with deoxyribonuclease I
          (amplification grade; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>).
          To minimize differences in efficiency of the reverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> reaction, the various isotype complementary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNAs</ENAMEX> (cDNAs) were produced in a single tube. Aliquots
          were then used in quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> to determine the
          relative amount of each isotype cDNA independently. PCR
          reactions were performed with isotype-specific primer
          pairs for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-tubulin isotype</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVa</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVb</ENAMEX> as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , with minor modifications to
          correct mismatches and to match the melting temperatures
          more closely. Similar gene-specific primers were designed
          for classes V and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In preliminary
          experiments the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II primers gave rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> PCR
          products of approximately equal intensity, differing in
          size by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> base pairs. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> products were cloned
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pCR-4</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX>-cloning vector, and subsequently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX>. The results showed that the larger product was
          due to a tandem duplication at the reverse primer. Thus,
          new primers for the Î²-tubulin class II gene were
          designed. Î²-Tubulin cDNA was produced with gene-specific
          primers for each of the isotype mRNAs and Reflectase
          reverse transcriptase (Active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motif</ENAMEX>). Aliquots were used
          in quantitative real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> to determine independently
          the relative amount of each isotype cDNA.
          To obtain control cDNA template of a known quantity
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of standard curves, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> from PCR
          reactions was isolated from agarose gels with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONCERTâ„¢ Rapid Gel Extraction</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marligen</ENAMEX>). The
          concentration of purified cDNA was determined by
          analyzing serial dilutions on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA 500 LabChips</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agilent</ENAMEX>).
          Standard curves for each Î²-tubulin isotype cDNA were
          generated with real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> at the same time as data
          were collected for each of the tissue samples. With the
          use of triplicate samples and no template controls,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">real-time PCR</ENAMEX> (iCyclerâ„¢ iQ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYBR Green</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>) as the detection method was performed
          to quantify the mRNA levels for selected breast tissues.
          The amount of Î²-tubulin isotype mRNA in a known amount of
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was determined from standard curves.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Tubulin isotypes in breast tissues by
          immunohistochemistry
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> anonymous paired normal and tumor tissue
          samples were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHTN</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Selected
          breast tissue samples ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) were examined by
          immunohistochemistry for the presence of tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotypes</ENAMEX>. Thin sections from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two normal</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tumor) reacted moderately to strongly with
          monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+ IV</ENAMEX>. Both cellular and stromal staining were observed.
          Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4shows</ENAMEX> sections from a tumor sample that had
          relatively high levels of Î²-tubulin class III levels by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T18</ENAMEX>). Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against
          Î²-tubulin class III was also observed, mostly as diffuse
          background stromal tissue staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C), although
          occasionally more specific reactivity occurred. A
          previous examination of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five normal</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor breast</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> showed similar staining patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . In that
          study, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          also reacted moderately to strongly with cells, whereas
          Î²-tubulin class III was found in stromal cells and rarely
          in punctate, irregular staining patterns, suggesting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> sections of nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tubulin</ENAMEX> class III in
          normal tissues is a highly specific marker for neurons [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 19</NUMEX> ] and we therefore attribute most of the Î²-tubulin
          class III <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody reactivity</ENAMEX> in the breast tissues to
          the weak stromal reactivity and presence of nerve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Quantification of tubulin isotypes in breast
          tissues by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>
          To quantify tubulin isotypes in breast tissue samples
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) we developed a sensitive and reliable
          indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> (sensitive to levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g/ml tubulin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotype</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA assay</ENAMEX> was
          verified by quantitative Western blotting (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 3</ENAMEX>).
          These results suggested that Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I +
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> are the predominant tubulin isotypes in these tissues.
          This was verified by immunohistochemistry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), which
          demonstrated strong, specific staining by the antibodies
          against Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>. In the work
          presented here, each tissue sample was examined in
          duplicate on microtiter plates, and triplicate plates
          were measured to obtain means and standard deviations for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isotype</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). There was no difference in tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotype</ENAMEX> levels in normal and tumor tissues. The
          predominant isotype fraction was Î²-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX>
          Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.09</NUMEX> of the total). Both Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes III and I +
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> were expressed in smaller amounts in all tissues (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Â± 0.08 and 0.26 Â± 0.08</NUMEX>, respectively). Figures 5Aand
          5Bshow Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV and II</ENAMEX> plotted as a
          percentage of total tubulin (excluding Î²-tubulin class
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, as discussed above), showing that in each tissue
          sample Î²-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predominated</ENAMEX>. Figure 5Cshows
          the distribution of Î²-tubulin class III. Several samples
          had relatively high levels of Î²-tubulin class III. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of
          these, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N16 and T18</TIMEX>, were examined by immunohistochemistry
          to determine whether the high level of Î²-tubulin class
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> might be due to upregulation of this isotype in tumor
          or normal cells; however, as discussed above, only
          stromal staining was observed.
          The fraction of Î²-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> in tissues varied
          from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.41 to 0.76</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6Ashows</NUMEX> the similar
          distributions of Î²-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> in both normal and
          tumor tissues. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6Bindicates</NUMEX> the relative
          frequencies of fractions of Î²-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>,
          demonstrating a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution for the tissue
          samples. Student 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests comparing normal and tumor
          tissue samples showed no difference in mean fraction of
          Î²-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.60 Â± 0.10 and 0.56 Â± 0.07</NUMEX> for tumor
          and normal tissues, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t = -1.454</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests for tumor versus normal
          Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes III or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I + IV</ENAMEX> also showed no
          significant difference: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.776</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.44</NUMEX>; and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.741</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.46</NUMEX>.) The varying amounts of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotypes</ENAMEX> in these tissue samples suggest that isotype
          levels might be correlated with other biomarkers of poor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Correlation of Î²-tubulin isotype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA
          levels
          To establish whether Î²-tubulin isotype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels
          could be inferred from mRNA levels, we used quantitative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">real-time PCR</ENAMEX> to measure Î²-tubulin mRNA levels in
          selected breast tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T1, N1, T4, N4, T12,</ENAMEX>
          N12, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T13</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N13</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T15</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N15</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T18</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N18</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N6</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T14</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
          These data show a broad distribution of mRNA content for
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> Î²-tubulin isotype classes. The lowest levels
          were found for Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>. The ranges
          of tubulin levels for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isotype classes</ENAMEX> were
          similar. Although differences between matched tumor and
          normal tissues were found, there were no correlations
          suggesting the upregulation or downregulation of specific
          tubulin isotypes in tumor tissues compared with normal
          (data not shown). When the fraction of mRNA for Î²-tubulin
          classes I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> were plotted against the
          corresponding fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, it became evident that
          there is no correlation between tubulin mRNA and protein
          levels in these tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu</ENAMEX> and Î²-tubulin class II
          expression
          In an attempt to understand the significance of the
          distributions of Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> in
          normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor breast tissues</ENAMEX>, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISAs</ENAMEX> to
          quantify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein</ENAMEX> levels in these tissues.
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu</ENAMEX> is amplified in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of all breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> and data suggest that it might be a negative
          prognostic indicator [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9Ashows</NUMEX> the levels
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein normalized</ENAMEX> for total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in tumor
          and normal tissues. Higher Her2/neu levels were found in
          all tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. This
          result verifies the pathology reports (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) that
          describe the tumor samples as tumors. Note that one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'normal</ENAMEX>' tissue, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N12</TIMEX>, was shown to have relatively high
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein</ENAMEX>. However, an independent
          pathology report on this tissue sample indicated a
          significant number of tumor cells throughout the entire
          breast tissue, even though the 'normal' sample was
          excised at a site distant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>.
          The increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein</ENAMEX> in tumor tissues
          compared with normal tissues is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9Bto be
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30-fold</NUMEX>. The inset in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          9Acompares <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein</ENAMEX> levels in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
          cell line that overexpresses <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu</ENAMEX> with one that does
          not. The increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Her2</TIMEX>/neu overexpressing cells is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40-fold</NUMEX>. We infer from these data that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast tumor</ENAMEX> tissues approaching this level of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu</ENAMEX>
          expression would have significantly increased <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu</ENAMEX>
          levels. Plots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10A) or fold
          increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Her2</TIMEX>/neu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10B) against Î²-tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">class</ENAMEX> II fraction demonstrate no significant correlation.
          There is therefore no relationship between tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotype</ENAMEX> levels and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein</ENAMEX> expression.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tubulin</ENAMEX> class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> predominates in breast
          tissues
          This is the first quantitative comparison of tubulin
          isotype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in human tissues. Previous work
          has indicated that vertebrate tissues vary in their
          tubulin isotype composition. Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tubulin</ENAMEX> class II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predominates</ENAMEX> in brain tissues and has been found in
          smaller amounts in other tissues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 45</NUMEX> ] . Classes III
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVa</ENAMEX> are primarily found in neurons, whereas classes I
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVb</ENAMEX> are found in many tissues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 19</NUMEX> ] . Î²-Tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">class V</ENAMEX> is present in small amounts in many cell types [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] and class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX> is found in blood cells and
          hematopoietic tissues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] . Much of this
          quantitative work was done by comparing mRNA levels.
          However, mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels are not correlated for
          many human and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast proteins</ENAMEX>, especially those that are
          regulated by post-transcriptional processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52 53</NUMEX> ]
          , although there is controversy regarding correct
          statistical analysis and interpretation of some of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . Intracellular tubulin levels are under both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> and post-transcriptional control.
          Fine-tuning of tubulin levels during the cell cycle
          occurs by autoregulation. This process alters mRNA
          stability and requires both an essential sequence on
          polysomal Î²-tubulin mRNA and an amino-terminal
          Met-Arg-Glu-Ile sequence on the nascent tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56 57</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, Î±-tubulin mRNA
          levels remain high even when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> is
          repressed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . In fact, Î±-tubulin synthesis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHO</ENAMEX>
          cells seems to have a role in regulating Î²-tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels.
          This phenomenon of tubulin post-transcriptional
          autoregu-lation was demonstrated in a wide variety of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrate</ENAMEX> and invertebrate cell types. It suggests that
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tubulin</ENAMEX> isotype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels are all
          similarly regulated, although this has not been
          demonstrated. Because the total amount of intracellular
          tubulin depends on both mRNA stability and protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">half-life</ENAMEX>, these data together indicate that high levels
          of tubulin mRNA might be associated with low levels of
          free tubulin subunits. This is supported by the recent
          mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing work that
          demonstrated a lack of correlation between tubulin
          isotype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels and mRNA levels in
          paclitaxel-resistant cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . However, tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels are currently interpreted by most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> as directly representing the total
          intracellular tubulin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> pool. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> alternative to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> quantification is immunostaining. Although
          immunostaining of cells is useful for localizing proteins
          in tissues and cells, accurate quantification by this
          method is difficult [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Nevertheless, quantitative
          measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels is crucial for
          understanding intracellular events. In our studies,
          quantitative real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> data from selected breast
          tissue samples revealed that Î²-tubulin mRNA and protein
          levels are not correlated. These results indicate that
          quantitative studies of Î²-tubulin isotypes that are done
          exclusively with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> techniques should be interpreted
          with caution because functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels cannot be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inferred</ENAMEX>.
          Consistent with our results is the finding of both
          Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX> by immunostaining in many
          human tissues and cell types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . To understand the
          relationship between the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> levels and the
          development of drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, it is essential to know
          the actual protein amounts in tissues and cells. We
          demonstrate here by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quantitative ELISA assay</ENAMEX> that the
          Î²-tubulin class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is on average the most
          abundant isotype in human breast tissues. We found a
          distribution of Î²-tubulin class II levels, ranging from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.41</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.76</NUMEX>. This wide distribution was not expected,
          because our study of tubulin isotypes in pig brains
          showed very little brain-to-brain variation. To evaluate
          the significance of the distribution of Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and I + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> in breast tissues, we measured the tissue
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Her2/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neu protein</ENAMEX>, known to be amplified in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>
          of all breast tumors and associated with poor prognosis [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> ] . All tumor tissues expressed higher levels of
          Her2/neu relative to normal tissues. However, there was
          no correlation between this biomarker and levels of
          Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I + IV</ENAMEX> isotype levels. Thus the
          significance of the range of isotype levels in breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> remains unknown. Although it is possible that
          Î²-tubulin class II levels might be correlated with a
          prognostic bio-marker not yet examined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] , these
          results suggest that a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-to-patient
          variation might exist.
          The ELISA method described here involves total
          extraction of tubulin and does not differentiate between
          polymeriz-able and nonpolymerizable tubulin fractions.
          There are reports of tubulin isotypes that are
          differentially incorporated into microtubule structures [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> ] . However, it is not possible to fractionate
          microtubules from total cytoplasmic tubulin with
          quick-frozen human tissue samples. Current experiments
          are exploring this aspect of tubulin isotype utilization
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture studies. One complexity in our work is
          the sampling of breast tissue. It is possible that
          samples are composed of different amounts of
          heterogeneous cell types. However, because our data show
          similar isotype amounts in normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor breast</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, differential tissue sampling seems not to be an
          issue in these experiments. Our method is based in part
          on an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA assay</ENAMEX> developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrower</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> ] for tubulin extracts. This work fulfills their
          suggestion to quantify changes in tubulin isotype levels
          with the appropriate antibodies, and establishes a
          sensitive and accurate assay to complement mRNA assays
          and studies of the response of cultured cells to
          antimitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> diagnoses for these tumor samples were
          most commonly infiltrating ductal carcinoma (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          samples). We found no correlations between tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotype</ENAMEX> levels and any of the variables given in the
          pathology reports (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, age, race, or histology grade). It should be
          noted that the 'normal' breast tissues examined in this
          study were excised from a site distal to the tumor site
          but in the same breast. Histological examination of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'normal</ENAMEX>' tissues indicates the presence of fibrocystic
          changes in many of the samples and therefore, although
          these changes are not uncommon in normal aging, they
          cannot be classified as truly 'normal' breast tissue.
          However, independent pathology reports determined that
          the 'normal' tissues were 'non-tumor' tissues with the
          exception of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N12</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N13</ENAMEX>, in which tumor cells were
          noted. N1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N13</ENAMEX> were estimated to contain more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          tumor cells. N12, however, had tumor cells throughout the
          breast tissue and therefore although the 'normal' sample
          was taken distal to the tumor it contained significant
          numbers of tumor cells. N12 was also shown in our ELISA
          studies to have relatively high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Her2/neu ELISAs</ENAMEX> provided a second
          means of grossly differentiating between 'tumor' and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'normal</ENAMEX>' tissues for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          It is important to note that many tumor tissues do not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">express Her2/neu</ENAMEX>; it is therefore not a generally useful
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> for differentiating between tumor and normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. In addition, our work demonstrates that although
          Î²-tubulin class III is a marker for aggressive
          neuroendocrine tumors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 64</NUMEX> ] , it is not a significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomarker</ENAMEX> in breast tumors. We speculate that this is
          because breast tissue rarely dysregulates to
          neuroendocrine cell types.
        
        
          Tumor and normal breast tissues have similar
          tubulin isotype levels
          Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> paclitaxel and docetaxel have
          become important chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for both ovarian
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Considerable interest has
          focused on the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> - and mechanisms
          underlying efficacy, toxicity, and drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 27 28</NUMEX> ] . Whether tubulin isotype levels might
          determine cellular responses to antimitotic agents
          remains controversial. For example, paclitaxel-resistant
          lung cancer cells and ovarian tumors were shown to have
          increased levels of tubulin isotypes, particularly
          Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes III and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, when
          paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells were treated with
          antisense oligonucleotides for Î²-tubulin class III, the
          drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> was partly reversed, coincident with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">decreased protein</ENAMEX> levels of Î²-tubulin class III [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] .
          However, it should be noted that Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IVa</ENAMEX> all increased significantly in
          paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells, indicating that
          the drug effect did not uniquely involve a single tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotype</ENAMEX>. In other work, Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tubulin</NUMEX> classes III and IVa
          were shown to increase in paclitaxel-resistant prostate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . However, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isotypes
          continued to be expressed in the lowest amounts.
          In ovarian cancer cells, mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> near
          the putative paclitaxel-binding site of Î²-tubulin class I
          were found in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] . Other work suggests that changes in tubulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotypes</ENAMEX> alone cannot confer resistance to antimitotics.
          It was demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of antimitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>,
          vinca alkaloids, bind with similar affinity to all
          Î²-tubulin isotypes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , thus suggesting for therapy
          with vinorelbine, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">vinblas-tine</ENAMEX>, or vincristine that
          tubulin isotype levels are incidental for efficacy.
          Furthermore, transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> with Î²-tubulin
          classes <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, II</ENAMEX>, or IVb did not produce resistance to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paclitaxel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The alternative hypothesis, derived
          from the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabral</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, is that rather
          than the tubulin isotype levels, the amount of
          polymerized tubulin is the critical factor that regulates
          response to antimitotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. For example, total amounts
          of polymerizable tubulin are decreased in
          paclitaxel-resistant cells, whereas col-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cemid</NUMEX>-resistant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubulin</ENAMEX> or vinca alkaloid-resistant cells have increased
          levels of assembled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tubulin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 66 67</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore,
          when cells were transfected with Î²-tubulin class III,
          weak resistance to paclitaxel was found, and this
          resistance was associated with decreased microtubule
          stability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] . This is consistent with the different
          modes of action of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>: paclitaxel stabilizes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microtubules</ENAMEX> and colcemid inhibits tubulin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. In
          support of this hypothesis, tubulin mutations consistent
          with altered assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> have been identified in
          paclitaxel-resistant and vinca alkaloid-resistant cells [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 66 69</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        We demonstrate that normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor breast tissues</ENAMEX>,
        before chemotherapy or radiation treatment, have broad
        distributions of Î²-tubulin isotypes. Furthermore, Î² class
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> tubulin predominates in most breast tissues. The
        Î²-tubulin isotype levels in normal and tumor tissue are not
        significantly different and are therefore unlikely to
        contribute to differential responses of tumors to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antimitotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. The initial drug sensitivity might
        depend upon the levels of polymerized tubulin in normal
        versus tumor tissues associated with the differential
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPs</ENAMEX> and dynamics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> such as stathmin
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] , a hypothesis currently being explored in our
        laboratory. The work presented here describes untreated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> and should be useful for comparison with
        paclitaxel-treated tumors as a basis for evaluating tubulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotype</ENAMEX> levels in response to therapy or in the development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
