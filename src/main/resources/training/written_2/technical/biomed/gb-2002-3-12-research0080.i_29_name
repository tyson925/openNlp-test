        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the goals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila Genome Project</ENAMEX> is to
        define experimentally the transcribed portions of the
        genome by producing a collection of fully sequenced cDNAs.
        We have previously reported the construction of cDNA
        libraries from a variety of tissues and developmental
        stages; these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were used to generate over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX>
        expressed sequence tags (ESTs), corresponding to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70%</NUMEX> of the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding genes</ENAMEX> in
        the 
        Drosophila melanogaster genome [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. We used computational analysis of these ESTs to
        establish a collection of putative full-length cDNA clones,
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Gene Collection</ENAMEX> (DGC) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. Here, we describe the process by which we sequenced the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> inserts of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8,921 cDNA</NUMEX> clones from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX>, describe
        the methods by which we assess each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clone</ENAMEX>'s likelihood of
        containing a complete and accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding region,
        and illustrate how these data can be used to uncover
        additional cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX>. We have confirmed the
        identification of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,375 cDNA</NUMEX> clones that can be used with
        confidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression or genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> strategy
          Current approaches to full-insert sequencing of cDNA
          clones include concatenated cDNA sequencing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], primer
          walking [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and strategies using transposon insertion
          to create priming sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. We adopted a
          cDNA sequencing strategy that relies on an 
          in vitro transposon insertion
          system based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MuA</ENAMEX> transposase, combined with primer
          walking (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods for details).
          The production of full-insert sequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> cDNAs
          is summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DGCr1</TIMEX>, clones were
          sized before sequencing. Small clones (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1.4</NUMEX> kilobases
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">kb</NUMEX>)) were sequenced with custom primers and larger
          clones were sequenced using either mapped or unmapped
          transposon insertions. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DGCr2</TIMEX>, clones were not sized
          and a set of unmapped transposon insertions was sequenced
          to generate an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Ã—</NUMEX> sequence coverage. For both
          DGCr1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r2</ENAMEX>, custom oligonucleotide primers designed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autofinish</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] were used to bring the sequences
          to high quality. To date, we have completed sequencing
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DGCr1</NUMEX> clone set and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DGCr2</NUMEX> clone
          set. The strategy used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sequencing DGCr1</TIMEX> clones
          appears to be more efficient, because on average they
          required fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> reads than DGCr2 clones.
          However, we were able to reduce cycle time and increase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">throughput</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> strategy adopted for
          sequencing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the DGCr2</TIMEX> clones. The average insert size of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,770</NUMEX> high-quality cDNA sequences that have been
          submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kb and they total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">megabases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) of sequence. The largest clone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD01389</NUMEX>)
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.7</NUMEX> kb and is derived from a gene ( 
          CG10011 ) that encodes a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,119</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid ankyrin repeat-containing protein</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Evaluating the coding potential of each cDNA on the
          basis of its full-insert sequence
          For many potential uses in proteomics and functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>], it is important to establish cDNA
          collections comprised only of cDNAs with complete and
          uncorrupted open reading frames (ORFs). To determine
          which of our sequenced clones meet this standard, we
          compared them to the annotated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genome sequence
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>] using a combination of BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sim4</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods for
          details).
          We grouped the cDNAs into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> category contains a total of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,916 cDNA</NUMEX> clones,
          or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> of the sequenced clones. We are confident that
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,375</NUMEX> of these clones contain a complete and accurate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>, as they precisely match the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> for the corresponding gene. An additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">541</NUMEX>
          clones are from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and AT <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, which were
          generated from fly strains that are not isogenic with the
          strain used to produce the genome sequence. The predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> from clones from these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were required to be
          identical in length to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted protein
          with less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> difference to be placed in
          this category. We cannot at present distinguish whether
          these differences result from strain polymorphisms or
          reverse transcriptase (RT) errors. However, our own
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> errors (see below), based on the
          observed nucleotide substitution rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX> derived
          from the same strain as the genomic sequence, and
          published estimates of strain polymorphisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] lead us
          to believe that the majority of these changes are the
          result of strain polymorphism.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> category represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,450</NUMEX> clones that are
          known to be compromised in one of a number of ways. The
          sequences of the largest class of compromised clones
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,314</NUMEX>) align to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted transcripts, but
          have nucleotide discrepancies that are most likely the
          result of errors generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> during library
          construction. These include missense and frameshift (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/-1</ENAMEX>
          or +<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/-2</ENAMEX> nucleotide difference) changes in the predicted
          ORF relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Clones
          placed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> can show up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          differences from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> peptide for isogenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 4%</NUMEX> difference for non-isogenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>. We estimated the error rate of an
          RNAseH-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SuperScriptII, Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>,
          CA) by comparing the nucleotide sequence of cDNAs from
          isogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> to the genomic sequence. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GH</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], we observed an error rate
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX>; for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], we
          observed an error rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX>. This difference is
          likely due to the different RT reaction conditions used
          in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> construction protocols [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
          Although these numbers are higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX>
          figure reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SuperScriptII</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taurai Nenguke</ENAMEX>,
          personal communication), the 
          in vitro assay used to obtain this
          error rate is based on assaying a single site for
          mutations that revert an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">amber</ENAMEX> codon.
          The next largest class of compromised clones (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">768</ENAMEX>)
          consists of clones apparently truncated at their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' ends,
          as judged by comparison to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted ORFs
          of the corresponding genes. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">768 5</NUMEX>'-short clones
          represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">757</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotated transcripts.
          For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-short clones, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DGCr1</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from DGCr2</TIMEX>, we were able to identify clones with longer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">additional EST</TIMEX> sequencing. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">606</NUMEX>
          clones are assumed to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' short because they do not
          possess a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' in-frame stop codon and the corresponding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated ORF</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> extends further <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'. This class
          of clones represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 9%</NUMEX> of all finished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, consistent with our original estimates that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80-94%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> clones would contain the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>].
          The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> classes of compromised clones
          consist of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">368 cDNAs</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> of all finished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eighty-three</TIMEX> clones encode ORFs
          that are truncated at their carboxy-termini and are most
          likely the result of priming from internal poly(A)
          tracts. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> clones contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unrelated ORFs
          and are almost certainly the result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cDNAs being
          cloned into the same plasmid vector during library
          construction. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX> clones contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORFs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 50</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and eleven</NUMEX> clones overlap a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted gene but are transcribed from the
          opposite strand from that of the mRNA encoding the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and are considered anti-sense
          transcripts; a number of such cases were documented in
          the reannotation of the genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] and have been
          reported in many organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-one</NUMEX> clones
          correspond to transcripts of transposable elements on the
          basis of their sequence similarity to identified 
          Drosophila transposons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
          Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> clones contain a bacterial transposable
          element (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tn10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IS1</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IS2</NUMEX>) that most likely inserted into
          the clone during propagation in 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> (bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contaminants</ENAMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> categories consist of clones that
          may represent alternative transcripts (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">138</ENAMEX>) and clones
          that are currently computationally unclassified (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">417</ENAMEX>),
          respectively. The summary of the analysis of these clones
          is described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DrosophilacDNA</ENAMEX> resource
          We have identified and sequenced cDNA clones that
          contain a complete and accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of all
          predicted 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. We plan on
          extending this project in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. First, we intend to
          increase the number of genes represented in this set of
          fully vetted cDNA clones using a combination of
          experimental approaches. We can use site-directed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> to correct clones that carry single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> changes or other small, localized defects. For
          the majority of the compromised clones, we have candidate
          replacement clones available that were identified as part
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our EST</TIMEX> sequencing and analysis efforts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Generation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> annotation of the genome made
          extensive use of our full-insert sequence data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In
          the course of that effort, human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> identified a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,013</NUMEX> clones that have become <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the DGCr3</TIMEX>. The
          DGCr3 currently includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">309</NUMEX> clones chosen to replace
          clones with truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">543</NUMEX> clones for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are
          not currently represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">833</NUMEX> clones that
          represent alternative splicing forms. To identify cDNAs
          for the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, we plan on using a combination
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">additional EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sequencing</TIMEX>, reverse transcriptase PCR
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>) and cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> screening. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we plan on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transferring ORFs</ENAMEX> to a universal cloning system (see [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>] for examples) in order to generate a standard
          reagent for proteomics and other functional genomic
          experiments. In collaboration with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orbigen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], we have
          already generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> baculovirus expression clones from a
          set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gateway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA) clones encoding
          transcription factors.
        
        
          mRNA editing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX> is a well-documented mechanism of
          generating nucleotide diversity beyond that directly
          encoded by the genome. Adenosine deaminase (ADAR) targets
          double-stranded regions of nuclear-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>,
          catalyzing the deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine
          (I) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Inosine mimics guanosine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) in its
          base-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pairing</NUMEX> properties, and the translational machinery
          of the cell interprets I as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX> In this way, an A-to-I
          conversion in the mRNA can alter the genetic information
          and, consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function. Null mutations in
          the single 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ADAR gene</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (dADAR) suggest that the
          function of pre-mRNA editing is to modify adult behavior
          by altering signaling components in the nervous system [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>]. Among the mRNAs known to be edited in 
          Drosophila are those encoded by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cacophony</ENAMEX> (a calcium channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>)
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralytic</ENAMEX> (a sodium channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>] and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GluCla</ENAMEX> (a chloride channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>], all of which have multiple editing sites in their
          coding sequences.
          In the course of evaluating the quality of the DGCr1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DGCr2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX>, described above, we compared their
          translation products to those of the recently completed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genomic sequence. Such comparisons should
          reveal cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX>. In cases in which the
          predicted protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> disagreed, we examined the
          corresponding nucleotide sequences in search of
          site-specific A-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> variation between cDNA and genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX> candidates consistent
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX>; however, additional cDNA or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data
          will be required to distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX> from RT
          errors or strain polymorphisms. In a few cases we had
          enough cDNA and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> data to indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX> is
          the most likely explanation for the observed variation.
          One such example is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The gene 
          CG18314 encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled
          receptor of the rhodopsin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, containing a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domain with similarity to Î² 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and
          human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> potential sites of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA editing</ENAMEX> were
          revealed by comparison of the genomic sequence with those
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cDNAs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. We validated these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> sites
          by gene-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of
          isogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> new sites (see legend
          to Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We are now in the process of a more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rigorous</ENAMEX> and thorough analysis of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-editing
          targets.
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> strategy
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Gene Collection</ENAMEX> (DGC)
          consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> releases, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DGCr1 and DGCr2</TIMEX>. A process flow
          diagram of our sequencing strategies is available online
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] and is summarized below. The clones in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DGCr1</TIMEX> were
          arrayed by insert size [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and sequenced accordingly;
          clones in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DGCr2</TIMEX> were not arrayed by size. DGCr1 clones
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> kb were assembled using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phrap</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] and
          analyzed with custom scripts to determine whether they
          were complete. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autofinish</ENAMEX> (part of the consed computer
          software package) was used to automatically design custom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] for clones that needed quality improvement.
          Clones that did not finish in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of
          Autofinish were sent to a manual finishing queue for more
          sophisticated finishing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> kb
          were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4 to 3</NUMEX> kb, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> kb,
          and greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> kb. All clones were sequenced using
          the 
          in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Template Generation System</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX> tmFinnzyme). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clones 3</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> kb in size, were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> using a minimal path of transposon-bearing
          clones. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clones</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4 to 3</NUMEX> kb and those greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>
          kb, were sequenced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 and 48</NUMEX> unmapped
          transposon-bearing clones, respectively. After the
          initial cycle of transposon sequencing, the clones were
          analyzed using in-house scripts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autofinish</ENAMEX> to
          determine their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of completeness and quality. DGCr2
          clones were sequenced using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> unmapped
          transposon-bearing clones. After an initial cycle of
          transposon sequencing, the clones were analyzed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">completeness</ENAMEX> and quality as described above for DGCr1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, using in-house scripts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autofinish</ENAMEX>. DGCr2
          clone sequences were screened for transposable element
          sequences, cases of co-ligation, and presence of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail before any finishing work was ordered.
        
        
          In vitrotransposition and mapping insertion
          sites
          Transposon insertion reactions were carried out in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Template Generation System</ENAMEX> (TGS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tm</ENAMEX>) according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s recommendations
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnzyme</ENAMEX>). Transposon reactions consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50-150 ng</NUMEX>) plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qiagen</ENAMEX> or Revprep
          DNA isolation robots, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 Î¼l</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">5Ã—</ENAMEX> reaction buffer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ng
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entranceposon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kan R</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 Î</NUMEX>¼l MuA transposase, and
          deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to bring the final volume to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 Î¼l</NUMEX>.
          Reactions were carried out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> plates and incubated in
          an ABI thermocycler according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          instructions. After heat inactivation of the MuA
          transposase, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the reaction were used to transform
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DH5Î±</TIMEX> chemically competent cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format. Following incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">183</NUMEX> Î¼l SOC medium, cells were plated onto appropriate
          medium selecting for vector and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entranceposon</ENAMEX> antibiotic
          resistance. Plates were incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37Â°C overnight</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colonies</ENAMEX> were picked into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>-ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypropylene</ENAMEX> titer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tubes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E&K Scientific</ENAMEX>) containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml LB medium
          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5%</NUMEX> glycerol and the appropriate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> and incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37Â°C overnight</TIMEX>. These stocks
          were then used to inoculate <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 ml</NUMEX> 2XYT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well
          square deep-well plates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E&K Scientific</ENAMEX>) for culture
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> plasmid preps. Transposon insertion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were
          mapped relative to the vector ends by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> essentially as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Forty-eight transposon-bearing clones
          were picked for PCR mapping using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mu-End</ENAMEX> primer
          (present at both ends of the tranposon) in combination
          with vector-specific primers, resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> PCR
          products. Agarose gels were imaged using custom software
          developed in-house (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Cornell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBNL</ENAMEX>) and analyzed
          using an algorithm, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Supertramp</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>], to identify a
          minimal path of transposon-bearing clones to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-arrayed and sequenced.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing
          Purified plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from transposon-bearing clones
          was sequenced using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼l ABI BigDye II Dye</ENAMEX> terminator mix
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>) in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-Î</NUMEX>¼l reaction. Sequencing
          reactions were processed through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadex G-50 SF</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiscreen</ENAMEX> filter plates; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Millipore</ENAMEX>) and loaded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">onto ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer</ENAMEX>. Sequencing primers
          specific for each end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entranceposon</ENAMEX> were used in
          the reactions (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATCAGCGGCCGCGATCC-3</ENAMEX>' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TTATTCGGTCGAAAAGGATCC-3</ENAMEX>'). Sequencing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          cDNA ends was carried out as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> reported here was carried out over a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year</TIMEX> period during which we made several major
          modifications to the strategy; for example, switching
          from sequencing mapped transposon insertions to random
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transposons</ENAMEX>. These changes improved throughput and cycle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, but made the process less efficient in terms of the
          required number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> reads. Because of these
          changes, it is not possible to give a meaningful single
          efficiency estimate; however, our overall efficiency is
          comparable to other efforts using a similar strategy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> processing and assembly
          cDNA clone data management relied on custom scripts
          and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Informix</ENAMEX> database. Sequences were processed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phred</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>] and assembled using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phrap</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> end-reads were combined with the transposon-based
          reads to generate cDNA clone assemblies. We adopted the
          sequence quality-control standards defined for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mammalian Gene Collection</ENAMEX> project [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Custom</ENAMEX> scripts
          evaluated assemblies for: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> reads in a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contig</ENAMEX> in the proper orientation; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) tail; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phrap</ENAMEX> estimated error rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX>
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>; and individual base quality of at least
          q25. Double-stranded coverage was not a criterion for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> to be considered finished; however, we have
          determined that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.2%</NUMEX> of all submitted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are
          double-stranded and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> of clones had complete
          double-stranded coverage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autofinish</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] was used to
          design primers to improve quality or extend sequence from
          multiple sequence contigs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones with an estimated
          error rate greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp</ENAMEX> were
          automatically identified and processed with additional
          rounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autofinish</ENAMEX> designed finishing work. If
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autofinish</ENAMEX> could not design primers, custom primers were
          designed manually using consed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Custom</ENAMEX> scripts were used
          to manually order primers to generate a further round of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX>.

          Analysis of finished cDNA sequences
          cDNA sequence was submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> with a
          preliminary annotation of the longest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> and a gene
          assignment based on a high BLASTN similarity score to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX> genome annotations. Subsequent processing was
          used to determine a more detailed analysis of the clone
          quality. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX>, sequence from each cDNA clone was
          compared to genomic sequence, predicted genes, predicted
          coding sequences (CDSs), known 
          Drosophila transposable elements,
          and 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> transposable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX>, the translation of the longest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> was compared to the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> translations
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Custom</ENAMEX> scripts were used to parse the BLAST output
          and record similarity results. We also compared the
          nucleotide sequence of each clone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> genome
          sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sim4</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 3</ENAMEX> predicted
          CDS with the highest BLAST score.
        
        
          mRNA editing
          We confirmed the sequence quality of the genomic
          region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">encompassing CG018314</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,731 bp</NUMEX>) by independently
          assembling an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18,284 bp contig</NUMEX> consisting solely of
          whole-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> (WGS) traces. The assembled sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contig</ENAMEX> has an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.6Ã—</NUMEX> sequence coverage. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phrap</ENAMEX> estimated error rate for each genomic base
          corresponding to a mRNA edited base is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">q90</TIMEX>. Similarly, we
          determined the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phrap</ENAMEX> estimated error rate for each mRNA
          edited base to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">q90</TIMEX>. We manually inspected
          chromatograms for high-quality discrepancies in the
          genomic sequence and found none, indicating that the
          edited <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> are not due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> heterozygosity. To
          validate the editing sites, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from
          heads from a mixed population of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female adult
          flies from the isogenic strain
