        Primary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sjögren's syndrome</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1°SS</NUMEX>) is a systemic
        autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">keratoconjunctivitis sicca</NUMEX>), dry mouth (xerostomia) as
        well as involvement of other exocrine glands. While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX> is
        typically considered an autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exocrinopathy</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> destruction can often extend to affect non-exocrine
        organs. Around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1°SS</ENAMEX> can present with
        involvement of other organs such as the thyroid, central
        nervous system, lungs, kidney and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1°SS</ENAMEX> was suggested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 40 years ago</TIMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . While liver involvement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX> has been considered
        "rare" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] only a few clinical studies specifically
        address this complication and evaluate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of
        1°SS [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Liver diseases associated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX> include primary
        biliary cirrhosis (PBC)-autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholangitis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] ,
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] , viral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] , sclerosing cholangitis
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and nodular regenerative hyperplasia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cirrhosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        We report the results of a review of cases undertaken to
        determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFTs</ENAMEX>) and liver disease in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX> referred to
        a tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of abnormal LFTs
        with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of
        1°SS.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Statistical analysis
          The statistical analysis included descriptive measures
          (means, standard deviations and ranges). Comparison of
          results of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with and without liver disease was
          done using t-tests of continuous variables and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s
          exact test or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">x2</NUMEX> for categoric measures.
        
      
      
        Results
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> charts reviewed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 53</TIMEX>) fulfilled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EECC</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX> and were
        initially included for analysis. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>
        of them (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) have had a salivary gland biopsy
        performed. In all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biopsy</ENAMEX> confirmed the
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sjögren's syndrome</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied had
        objective evidence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX>, including keratoconjunctivitis
        sicca, positive labial salivary gland biopsy,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> and/or salivary gland hypofunction. We
        excluded those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without these objective criteria of
        1°SS and also those who did not fulfill EECC criteria.
        The mean age at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of onset of disease was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 ± 20.5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> duration was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4.9 years</TIMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4.5 years</TIMEX>
        (mean ± range). Liver function tests had been determined in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80.8 %</NUMEX>) and abnormal liver function tests were
        found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49.1 %</NUMEX>). Further analysis
        was then undertaken in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFTs</ENAMEX> had been
        measured. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are shown in Tables 2and 3.
        For these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied, abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFTs</ENAMEX> were more
        common than any other potential non-exocrine features of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX>. Clinical evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>, defined in methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, was found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.3%</NUMEX>), all of whom had
        abnormal liver function tests. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> deaths occurred in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studied, both attributed to liver failure. An
        additional patient required a liver transplant. In all
        cases, the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1°SS</ENAMEX> antedated the onset of liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or its diagnosis. Markers of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">viral hepatitis</ENAMEX>,
        sought in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, were found only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        carried the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis B virus</ENAMEX> and one
        had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis C virus</ENAMEX>. In a liver biopsy of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who lacked serological markers for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>
        viruses, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B virus was detected by 
        in situ hybridization.
        Risk factors for liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> were identified in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with abnormal liver function tests and are
        described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. No association with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use was
        found. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had documented evidence of tobacco
        consumption. We found no significant differences in risk
        factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients
        with or without hepatic involvement. Therefore, in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with sub clinical or clinical evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>, no clear explanation for the abnormal LFTs
        was found, except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX>.
        The pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biochemical liver abnormalities</ENAMEX> was
        mainly hepatocellular (defined as predominant increase of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX> and/or ALT in comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> and/or bilirubins) in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cases; cholestatic (defined as predominant increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> and/or bilirubins compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX> and/or ALT) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> and
        mixed (evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular
        damage) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> cases. Abnormalities were persistent (present
        on every occasion when measured more than once) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65.5%</NUMEX> of those with abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFTs</ENAMEX>), intermittent
        (presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFT</ENAMEX> abnormalities was not found in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">determinations</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX>) and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5%</NUMEX>) there was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of liver function tests. The pattern
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver enzyme abnormalities</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. None of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with abnormal liver function tests had
        clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain
        the high levels of amino-transferases. Activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPK</ENAMEX> or
        aldolase was not elevated when measured in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with abnormal liver function tests.
        Anti-mitochondrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (AMA) and anti-smooth muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (ASMA) were sought in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, with positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASMA</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of abnormal liver function tests with
        other non-exocrine features of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1°SS</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with abnormal liver function tests were more
        likely to have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, kidney or hematological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manifestations</ENAMEX>, when compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sjögren</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX>. Presence of other non-exocrine features of
        1°SS was not influenced by prevalence of liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        Regarding laboratory test results, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation
        rate at some point during the course of their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. A
        positive anti-ENA (anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ro</ENAMEX>, anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ro</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La</ENAMEX>, and/or anti-RNP)
        was also associated with an increased prevalence of
        abnormal liver function tests (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The sample was
        too small to determine whether a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENA</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with liver disease. Other markers of systemic
        inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the
        presence or absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFT</ENAMEX> abnormalities.
        Liver biopsies, done in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, disclosed post-viral
        chronic active <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), cryptogenic cirrhosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>),
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case each of post-viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cirrhosis</ENAMEX>, alcoholic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>, and autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sjögren</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen at a tertiary
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, abnormal liver function tests were found to be
        a common non-exocrine feature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX>. The prevalence of
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was found to be higher in our study than
        in other previous series [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . The true
        prevalence could be even higher since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver enzyme</ENAMEX> profiles
        were not done in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The prevalence suggested in
        previous reports ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 to 58 %</NUMEX>, but the definition
        of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatomegaly</ENAMEX>) to well proven cases of liver disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 28</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denko</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> reported that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> had hepatosplenomegaly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Other studies done
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960</TIMEX>'s also confirmed hepatomegaly in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whaley</ENAMEX> reported liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> and mentioned an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-mitochondrial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsianos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        gastrointestinal complications, called from a large cohort;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, each with chronic
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Other studies have reported
        variable prevalence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 28</ENAMEX> ] and different
        histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from
        cholestatic liver damage (stage I primary biliary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cirrhosis</ENAMEX>) to chronic active <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
        virus.
        In our study, liver disease was associated with other
        non-exocrine manifestations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX>, specifically those
        affecting lung, kidney and blood cells. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        serological evidence of systemic inflammation, as shown by
        an elevated sedimentation rate, were more likely to have
        liver test abnormalities. Also, the presence of a positive
        anti-ENA correlated positively with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatic disease</ENAMEX>. An
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENA</ENAMEX> response with liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> has been
        described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>, where
        anti-ENA-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> demonstrated more severe liver
        test abnormalities than those who were anti-ENA-negative [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . In another study, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with various
        chronic liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> were found to be anti-RNP positive [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] .
        With etiopathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1°SS</ENAMEX> still an open question [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] , a possible role of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis C virus</ENAMEX> (HCV) has drawn
        attention. Recent studies have mentioned HCV incidence in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1SS</TIMEX> ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14-19%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 16 18 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands
        with immunohistochemistry in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1°SS</ENAMEX> has given conflicting results [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] Some reports mention that the salivary gland
        findings are strikingly similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with liver
        disease associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HCV</ENAMEX> infection than in those with
        1°SS [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , while others mention distinctive differences
        between both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> regarding focus score, expression of
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers</ENAMEX> in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glands</ENAMEX> and in epithelial cells, as well as differences in
        the degree of inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . Transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        models that carry the HCV envelope genes develop an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exocrinopathy</ENAMEX> affecting salivary and lachrymal glands [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] . Expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ
        between HCV-infection and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX>. Positive ENAs are rarely
        seen in HCV-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Also, in most cases sicca symptoms
        are not present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> as compared with
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1°SS</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Although the prevalence of viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis markers</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> was very low and did not account for most of the
        cases with abnormal liver function tests, these markers
        were not sought in a small percentage of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. It
        is important to note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> appears to account for a
        subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with exocrine complaints in which half
        the cases might meet the definition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> according to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manthorpe</ENAMEX> criteria. However, this subgroup is
        characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations
        observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX>, and the absence of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-La</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] .
        An aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and
        different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a
        mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1°</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Since it has been suggested that the target tissue
        involved in the autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">histopathologic lesions</ENAMEX> of 1°SS
        might be the epithelium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , it is interesting that the
        findings in our study point to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of liver
        disease with pulmonary and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal abnormalities</ENAMEX>, all which
        are characterized by epithelial damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] .
        Epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have been proposed to be active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> rather than passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in the chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX> but further studies are needed to
        establish the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver epithelial cells</ENAMEX> in the
        pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease, including
        the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> expression and cytokine secretion
        pattern in these cells.
        The co-existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX> and the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circulating AMAs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sjögren</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> sera has been
        pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">autoimmune</ENAMEX> and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 8 10</NUMEX> ] . In previous studies, a pericholangial
        lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage I
        of primary biliary cirrhosis, has been reported in 1°SS
        with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMA</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7</NUMEX> ] . In our review of cases, we found predominance in
        hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, which would argue against a PBC-type of liver
        damage. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> had proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBC</ENAMEX> should be considered a form of secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> that
        resembles more the "sicca complex" with exocrine features
        seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] .
        Limitations of the study come primarily from being a
        retrospective analysis. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were studied in
        a tertiary care referral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the severity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and the prevalence of the manifestations might be
        different from the general 1°SS <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, in
        many cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sjögren's syndrome</ENAMEX> diagnosis had been sought
        because of otherwise unexplained non-exocrine features.
        While we could not find an association between use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSAIDS</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> and prevalence of liver
        function tests abnormalities, the study design did not
        allow us to exclude the possibility of over-the-counter
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTC</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use that could have affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFT</ENAMEX>'s
        measurement. Drug toxicity is certainly an important factor
        to be considered. However, given that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of LFTs
        and that the use of hepatotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> was not elicited in
        the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with liver abnormalities, a toxic
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> could not be established.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Based on the results of this study, we consider that an
        evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should be done in every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX>,
        particularly if there is evidence of other non-exocrine
        complications or serological evidence of systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. Although no other diagnosis explaining liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> may be found, the disorders for which treatment
        might be beneficial (e.g. immunosuppressants for autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>, interferon-alpha for viral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>,
        ursodeoxycolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> for primary biliary cirrhosis) warrant
        a diligent search in all cases of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1°SS</TIMEX> with abnormal liver
        function.
