          Introduction
          Rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) is a chronic systemic
          autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> that is characterized by joint
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>, and progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and bone erosion.
          Recent research has identified certain biologic agents
          that appear more able than conventional therapies to halt
          effectively the progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, as well as
          ameliorate disease symptoms. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> potential problem with
          the use of biologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> therapy is the
          need for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> repeat dosing. The transfer of
          genes directly to the synovial lining can theoretically
          circumvent the need for repeat dosing and reduce
          potential systemic side effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. However,
          although many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been effective in treating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine CIA</ENAMEX> if administrated at a time before disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">onset</ENAMEX>, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intra-articular</ENAMEX> or periarticular gene
          transfer has not been highly effective in halting the
          progression of established disease. IL-4, similar to
          tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1 inhibitors</ENAMEX>, has
          been shown be therapeutic for the treatment of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
          when administered intravenously as a recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          either alone or in combination with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>. IL-4 can
          downregulate the production of proinflammatory and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-helper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Th</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-type cytokines by inducing mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX> and upregulating the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
          of proinflammatory cytokines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. IL-4 is able to inhibit IL-2
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX> production by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX> cells, resulting in
          suppression of macrophage activation and the production
          of the proinflammatory cytokines <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-1, IL-6, IL-8</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± by monocytes and macrophages [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5, 6, 7, 8,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Objective
          In order to examine the therapeutic effects of local
          and systemic IL-4 expression in established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, an
          adenoviral vector carrying the gene for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">murine</ENAMEX> IL-4
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) was generated. The ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to
          treat established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was evaluated by local
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periarticular</ENAMEX> and systemic intravenous injection of
          Ad-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mIL-4</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at various times after disease
          onset.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">q</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-8 weeks</TIMEX>, were
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>, ME,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were immunized intradermally at the base
          of tail with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">¼ g bovine type II collagen</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 21</TIMEX>
          after priming, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> received a boost injection
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">intradermally</NUMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">¼ g type II collagen</ENAMEX> in
          incomplete adjuvant. For the synchronous onset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¼ g lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intraperitoneally</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 28</TIMEX>.
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 was injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">periarticularly</ENAMEX> into the hind ankle
          joints of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 32</TIMEX> or intravenously by tail vein
          injection on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 29</TIMEX>. Disease severity was monitored every
          other day using an established macroscopic scoring system
          ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 4</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>, normal; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, detectable arthritis
          with erythma; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, significant swelling and redness; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          severe swelling and redness from joint to digit; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>,
          maximal swelling with ankylosis. The average of
          macroscopic score was expressed as a cumulative value for
          all paws, with a maximum possible score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>.
          Cytokine production by joint tissue or serum were
          assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>;

          Results
          To examine the therapeutic effects of IL-4 gene
          transfer in a murine model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Ã—10</NUMEX> 8particles
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 and enhanced green fluorescent protein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad-eGFP</ENAMEX>) were administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">periarticular</ENAMEX> injection
          into the ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with established disease 4
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lipopolysaccharide</TIMEX> injection. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had
          established disease at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of injection. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a), paw
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thickness</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b), and the number of arthritic paws
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c) were all significantly reduced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, compared with the saline- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eGFP</NUMEX>-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Analysis of the bones in the ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> showed evidence of erosion with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> monocytic infiltrate around the joint space
          compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated and nonarthritic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>. In addition, injection of the ankle
          joints in the hind legs resulted in a therapeutic effect
          in the front paws. A similar contralateral effect has
          been observed with adenoviral-mediated delivery of viral
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v)-IL-10</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, a high level of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          also was detected from the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lysates</ENAMEX> of
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated naÃ¯ve and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">arthritic mice</ENAMEX>, with the
          production of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> correlating with the dose
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of recombinant IL-4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein systemically</ENAMEX> has been shown to be therapeutic in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine CIA</ENAMEX> models if given before disease onset. To
          examine the effect of systemic IL-4 delivered by gene
          transfer, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1Ã—10 9particles</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> were injected via
          the tail vein of collagen-immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> injection. Whereas the immunized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, injected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad-eGFP</ENAMEX>, showed disease onset
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lipopolysaccharide</TIMEX> injection,
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> showed a delay in disease onset and
          as a reduction in the total number of arthritic paws.
          Also, systemic injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 suppressed the
          severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> mice according to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
          index.
        
        
          Discussion
          Gene therapy represents a novel approach for delivery
          of therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> in order to treat the
          pathologies associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and osteoarthritis, as
          well as other disorders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>. In the present
          study we examined the ability of local periarticular and
          systemic gene transfer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX> to treat established and
          early-stage murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, respectively. We have
          demonstrated that both local and systemic administration
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 resulted in a reduction in the severity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, as well as in the number of arthritic paws. In
          addition, the local gene transfer of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> reduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologic</ENAMEX> signs of inflammation and of bone erosion.
          Interestingly, local delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 was able to
          confer a therapeutic effect to the untreated, front paws
          through a currently unknown mechanism. In addition, both
          local and systemic expression of IL-4 resulted in an
          increase in the level of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>, as well as of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Previous experiments have shown
          that gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF inhibitors</ENAMEX>
          at the time of disease initiation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 28</TIMEX>) is
          therapeutic. However, delivery of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> after

          disease onset appeared to have only limited therapeutic
          effect. In contrast, the present results demonstrate that
          IL-4, resulting from local periarticular and systemic
          injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, was able partially to reverse
          progression of established and early-stage disease,
          respectively. These results, as well as those of others,
          support the potential application of IL-4 gene therapy
          for the clinical treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Introduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> is a chronic systemic autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> that is
        characterized by joint inflammation, and progressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and bone erosion. Currently the symptoms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> are managed using pharmacologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, including
        both steroidal and nonsteroidal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and
        disease-modifying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such as methotrexate. No
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacologic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have yet proven effective in halting
        the progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, however. Recent research has
        identified certain biologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that appear more able
        than conventional therapies to halt effectively the
        progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, as well as ameliorate disease
        symptoms. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> have
        proven effective in clinical trials, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Food and</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Administration</ENAMEX> has approved the use of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for treatment of human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> potential problem
        with the use of biologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> therapy is
        the need for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> repeat dosing. The transfer of
        genes directly to the synovial lining can theoretically
        circumvent the need for repeat dosing and reduce potential
        systemic side effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Ex-vivo and in-vivo methods
        have been used to deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">therapeutic genes</ENAMEX> such as those
        that encode <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX>, soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1 receptors</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> to arthritic mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>],
        and rabbit joints [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Although many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been
        effective in treating murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> if they are administered
        before disease onset, local periarticular gene transfer has
        not been highly effective in halting the progression of
        established disease.
        IL-4, similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1 inhibitors</ENAMEX>, has been
        shown be therapeutic for the treatment of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> when
        administered intravenously as a recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, either
        alone or in combination with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>. IL-4 can down-regulate
        the production of proinflammatory and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX>-type cytokines by
        inducing mRNA degradation and upregulating the expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of proinflammatory cytokines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. IL-4 is able to inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-Î³</ENAMEX> production by
        Th1 cells, resulting in suppression of macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and the production of the proinflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± by monocytes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> inhibits
        growth factor-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synoviocyte proliferation, and
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> and matrix
        metalloproteinase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial fibroblast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>], and reduces bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resorption</ENAMEX>. Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> is able
        to inhibit the production of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, block
        synovial cell proliferation and bone loss, and promote the
        formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX>, it represents an attractive
        cytokine for treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> by gene transfer.
        To examine the therapeutic effects of local and systemic
        IL-4 expression in established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, we have generated an
        adenoviral vector carrying the gene for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">murine</ENAMEX> IL-4
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to treat established
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was evaluated by local periarticular and systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intravenous</ENAMEX> injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mIL-4</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at various
        times after disease onset. Local injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4
        resulted in a reduction in the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> and
        joint swelling, and reduced macroscopic signs of joint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> and bone erosion. Injection of the ankle
        joints in the hind legs also resulted in a therapeutic
        effect in the untreated, front paws. A high level of
        endogenous murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> was detected in the joint tissues
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> injected locally with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Systemic delivery
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">murine</ENAMEX> IL-4 by intravenous injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad-mIL-4</ENAMEX> also
        resulted in a slight delay in the onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, with a
        significant reduction in the number of arthritic paws.
        These results demonstrate that local and systemic gene
        transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> is able to treat established and
        early-stage disease, respectively, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, and thus may be useful for clinical applications
        for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.

          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX>. They were
          maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pittsburgh Biotechnology Center</ENAMEX>. For
          local periarticular injection, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were anesthetized
          with inhalation of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> isoflurane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. A maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼
          l diluted adenovirus was injected into joint articular
          space under the ankle joint bone in each hind paw with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>-gauge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> syringe. For systemic delivery of
          adenovirus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500Î¼</NUMEX> l diluted adenovirus was injected
          intravenously via the tail vein.
        
        
          Vector construction and adenovirus
          generation
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 was constructed and propagated according to
          standard protocols, as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
          Briefly, recombinant adenoviruses were generated by
          homologous recombination in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CRE8</NUMEX> cells, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cell line
          that expresses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cre</ENAMEX> recombinase, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between psi</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, an
          Ad5-derived, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E1- and E3</TIMEX>-deleted adenovirus, and pAd-lox,
          the adenoviral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> vector that expresses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. The
          inserted cDNA sequences are expressed under the
          transcriptional control of human cytomegalovirus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
          Vectors were purified using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consecutive CsCl
          gradient ultracentrifugation, dialyzed at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> against
          sterile virus buffer, aliquoted, and stored at -80Â°C
          until use. The titers of the adenoviral stocks were
          determined by incubating serial dilutions of the stocks
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> min with sub-confluent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cells. Viral
          titers were calculated by determining the highest
          dilution that produced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> viral cytopathic effect,
          which was then multiplied by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> per well
          and by the dilution factor. CRE8 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX> cell lines were
          grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified eagle medium (GIBCO-BRL,
          Rockville, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine

          Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain
          H37Ra. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were immunized intradermally at the base
          of tail with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼ g collagen. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 21</TIMEX> after priming,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were boosted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100Î¼</NUMEX> g type II collagen in
          incomplete adjuvant. In order to synchronize the onset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¼ g lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) was injected
          intraperitoneally on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 28</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Disease evaluation
          Disease severity was assessed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day</TIMEX> using an
          established macroscopic scoring system ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4: 0</TIMEX>, normal; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> with erythma; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          significant swelling and redness; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, severe swelling and
          redness from joint to digit; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, maximal swelling with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ankylosis</ENAMEX>. The macroscopic score (mean Â± standard
          deviation) was expressed as a cumulative value for all
          paws, with a maximum possible score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>. The thickness
          of each paw was also measured using a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>-load
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caliper</ENAMEX>. The paw swelling for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> was calculated
          by adding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> thicknesses of the individual paws. In
          addition, the number of arthritic paws of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were counted and added to represent the number of
          arthritic paws in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments were performed
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times to ensure

          Histologic examination
          Joint tissues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">freshly dissected mice</ENAMEX> were
          immersion-fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> neutral buffered formalin and

          glycerol for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX>. Tissues were then dehydrated in
          graded alcohols, embedded in paraplast, sectioned at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5Î¼ m</ENAMEX>
          on a microtome, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
          Sections were evaluated in a blinded manner for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologic</ENAMEX> signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> and scored as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serum</ENAMEX> level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II collagen</ENAMEX> was
          measured using a standard ELISA assay. Briefly, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well
          Immuno-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxisorp Plate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nunc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naperville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX>-buffered saline. Sample sera were diluted to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:100000</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vol:vol</ENAMEX>) and incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">washing</ENAMEX>, bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody isotope</ENAMEX> was detected with

          Thereafter, plates were washed, incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼ l

          Cytokine production
          Cytokine production in the joint tissue or serum was
          assessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> systems). For measuring the
          cytokine production, peeled joint tissues from the upper
          portion of ankle to the middle of the paw were ground by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenizer</ENAMEX> in the equal volume of the lysis buffer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100mmol/l potassuim phosphate</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8 and 0.2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton-X</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>). Cytokine production was standardized as amount of

          To establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-week-old aged DBA1</TIMEX>/lacJ male mice
          were immunized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">¼ g bovine type II</ENAMEX> collagen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emulsified</ENAMEX> in complete adjuvant. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were boosted with the same amount of collagen in
          incomplete adjuvant, with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> pathology observed
          starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX> after immunization. In order to
          synchronize the onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, lipopolysaccharide
          was injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intraperitoneally</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 28</TIMEX>, excluding the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that had already showed signs of disease pathology.
          All of the collagen-immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had swollen and red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paws</ENAMEX> and ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> injection.
          In order to examine the therapeutic effects of IL-4
          gene transfer in a murine model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, increasing
          doses of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 recombinant virus were administered
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">periarticular</ENAMEX> injection into the hind ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with established disease <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> injection.
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had established disease
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of injection. However, the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a), paw thickness (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b), and the number of
          arthritic paws (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c) were all significantly reduced
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad-mIL-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, compared with the saline- and
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eGFP</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          Analysis of the bones in the ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">arthritic mice</ENAMEX> showed evidence of erosion with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> monocytic infiltrate around the joint space
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a) compared with the nonarthritic control joints.
          In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> showed
          less inflammatory joint tissue, reduction in bone
          erosion, and reduction in the number of inflammatory
          cells. The changes in histology of the ankle joints from
          sections from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were also scored in a
          blinded manner. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX>, significant
          inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression as assessed by joint
          histology was observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          These results suggest that local expression of IL-4
          after gene transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> with established disease
          could effectively protect tissue from inflammation as
          well as block bone erosion. It is important to note that
          the possible inflammatory responses to adenoviral
          injection were examined by injection of the same number
          of particles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad-mIL-4 and Ad</ENAMEX>-eGFP into naÃ¯ve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of
          DBA <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. At the doses of virus used, however, no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> was observed (data not shown).
        
        
          Reduction in disease severity in noninjected front
          paws by local injection of IL-4
          Previously, we have noted a contralateral effect, in
          which treatment of a diseased joint by
          adenovirus-mediated transfer of the gene that encodes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX> resulted in a therapeutic effect in noninjected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joints</ENAMEX>. To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 was able to confer
          a contralateral effect, the severity of disease in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hind</ENAMEX> and front paws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> injected only in the hind
          ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> was evaluated. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, a
          reduction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> index was observed in the
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> injected hind leg ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          Interestingly, the noninjected front paws also showed a
          statistically significant reduction in the severity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b). Taken together, these results
          suggest that local periarticular injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4
          resulted in a therapeutic effect in both injected and
          noninjected joints. However, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> is able
          to confer a contralateral therapeutic effect in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
          established disease.
        
        
          Stimulation of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> expression by local
          IL-4 gene delivery
          To test the level and duration of gene expression,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Ã—10</NUMEX> 8particles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-eGFP were
          injected periarticularly into the ankle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of naÃ¯ve
          DBA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Joint tissues were isolated at indicated time
          points, homogenized in lysis buffer, and the lysates
          analyzed for cytokine production by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>. Maximal IL-4
          expression was detected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX>, with the level
          gradually decreasing over time (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a). However, it is
          important to note that it is unclear whether the level of
          IL-4 detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> at the different time points
          is partially due to induction of endogenous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>.
          Interestingly, a high level of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> also was
          detected from the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lysates</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-injected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4b) that directly correlated with the dose
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 (data not shown). An increase in the level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> expression could even be detected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX> after
          injection of a high dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4.
          The levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> expression also were
          examined in arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35</TIMEX> after injection. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a</TIMEX>, a slight
          increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> expression was observed in that
          correlated with the dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5a). A similar
          increase at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 35</TIMEX> was also observed in naÃ¯ve <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown). In addition, a significant dose-dependent
          increase in the level of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 days</TIMEX> after
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5b). These results demonstrated that IL-4
          transgene expression was detectable for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 5 weeks</TIMEX>
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> delivery and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> was able to induce
          the production of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naÃ¯ve</ENAMEX> and immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In addition, expression of IL-4
          resulted in a twofold increase in the level of endogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> (data not shown). In contrast, periarticular
          injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> did not affect the level of
          expression of endogenous levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Taken together, these results
          suggest that the therapeutic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous</ENAMEX> IL-4
          could be mediated in part through the induction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Delay of disease onset by systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4
          administration
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of recombinant IL-4 protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systemically</ENAMEX> has been shown to be therapeutic in murine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> models if given before onset of disease onset. To
          examine the effect of systemic IL-4 delivered by gene
          transfer, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 9particles</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> were administered
          intravenously by tail vein injection of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>-immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> injection. Whereas the immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          injected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-eGFP showed disease onset on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> injection, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> showed a
          delay in disease onset (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6a) as well as a reduction
          in the total number of arthritic paws (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6c). In
          addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were
          disease-free for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 10 days</TIMEX> after lipopolysaccharide
          injection, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were disease free at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
          the experiment on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 65</TIMEX>. In addition, systemic injection
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 suppressed the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> mice according to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> index (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6b). Thus,
          systemic delivery of IL-4 by adenovirus-mediated gene
          transfer is able to reduce the onset and severity of
          early-stage disease.
        
        
          IL-4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> expression in sera of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> mice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administered Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> systemically
          To examine the duration of IL-4 expression as well as
          induction of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> expression, serum was
          collected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and tested for levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-4</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). An elevated level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-4</ENAMEX> was detected in
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7a) and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 30</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7c) after IL-4
          injection. In addition, although there was no observed
          increase in the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> in the sera at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          after systemic delivery of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7b), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> was
          elevated in the sera at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 35</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7d). In contrast,
          the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> in the saline or
          Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eGFP</NUMEX>-treated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were not significantly
          above background after either or local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> delivery.
          Thus, the early therapeutic effects of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> after
          systemic delivery most likely are not mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          In contrast, it is possible that the therapeutic effects
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> after local injection are conferred in part by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Gene therapy represents a novel approach for delivery of
        therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> in order to treat the
        pathologies associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and osteoarthritis, as well
        as other disorders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>. Previously, we and others
        have shown that local 
        ex vivo and 
        in vivo gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³, soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> receptor, and soluble TNF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> are able to block certain intra-articular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathologies</ENAMEX> in rabbit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, and murine models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
        IL-4, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>, is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> cytokine that has been
        demonstrated to be therapeutic for the treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> after systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of recombinant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        In the present study we examined the ability of local
        periarticular gene transfer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX> to treat established
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine CIA</ENAMEX>. We demonstrated that both local and systemic
        administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 resulted in a reduction in the
        severity of established and early-stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>,
        respectively, as well as in the number of arthritic paws.
        In addition, the local gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad-mIL-4</ENAMEX> reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologic</ENAMEX> signs of inflammation as well as bone erosion.
        Previous experiments have shown that gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF inhibitors</ENAMEX> at the time of disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">initiation</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 28</TIMEX>) was therapeutic. However, delivery of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> after disease onset appeared to have only
        limited therapeutic effect. In contrast, the present
        results demonstrate that local <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX> delivery was able
        partially to reverse progression of established disease
        after local periarticular injection.
        Interestingly, local and systemic expression of IL-4
        resulted in an increase in the level of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> as
        well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>. Previous reports have shown that an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> or possible synergistic therapeutic effect can be
        achieved in animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> with combined
        treatment with recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>. Treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> results in reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> production with a concomitant shift in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. The fact that the therapeutic
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> are potentially synergistic is
        possibly due to the fact that they suppress proinflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> production through different mechanisms. IL-4 is
        able to block transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1 genes</ENAMEX>, whereas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> stimulates degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        Thus, it is likely that the therapeutic effects we observed
        after local injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> are due to both exogenous
        IL-4 and endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> production. However, the delayed
        induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> after systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> suggests that the initial therapeutic effects are
        not conferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
        A mechanism whereby IL-4 may alter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-1Ra
        levels could involve the regulation of transcription
        factors that regulate the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX>. In particular, nuclear factor-Îº B and signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transducer</ENAMEX> and activator of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription-6</ENAMEX> are important
        for conferring transcriptional regulation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transducer</ENAMEX> and activator of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription-6</ENAMEX>, after tyrosine
        phosphorylation, can bind directly to nuclear factor-Îº B [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>], resulting in synergic activation in certain cell
        types.
        The present results suggest that gene transfer of IL-4
        can stimulate expression of endogenous cytokines, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX>, as well as possibly endogenous IL-4
        expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Endogenous IL-10</ENAMEX>, which can be induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>,
        is a natural suppressor of a number of inflammatory
        responses. Inhibition of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> with neutralizing
        antibodies enhanced endotoxic shock, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> immune
        complex-induced lung injury, and the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Periarticular</ENAMEX> delivery of murine or viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> by gene transfer resulted in the inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> in
        mouse models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 26</TIMEX>] if delivered before or at the time
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> onset. The present results are also consistent
        with the observation that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>, has been
        shown to enhance the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Ra</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> synovial
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 27</TIMEX>].
        IL-4 is a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in shifting the balance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Th1/Th2</ENAMEX> cells and skewing the production of antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Th2 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">effector cell differentiation</ENAMEX> also is
        dependent on the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-4</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">priming</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        Blocking endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neutralizing antibodies</ENAMEX> has
        been shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] to result not only in the absence of T
        cells with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th2</NUMEX>-like phenotype, but also in the appearance
        of T cells producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ after restimulation.
        IL-4 is also able to skew the production of antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtype</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. However, we have shown that anticollagen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> levels are already very high at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day 30</TIMEX> after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunization</ENAMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-4</ENAMEX> treatment did not significantly
        change these elevated levels (data not shown). In addition,
        we did not observe significant differences between IgG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotypes</ENAMEX> in the control and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mIL-4</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (data not
        shown). Thus, the mechanisms through which local and
        systemic IL-4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> are able to suppress <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> are
        still unclear.
        We have demonstrated previously that periarticular
        injection of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX>
        into the hind paws of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with early-stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> was
        able to confer a therapeutic effect in the untreated front
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paws</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX> into one knee of
        rabbits with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> was able to confer a
        therapeutic effect in the contralateral untreated knee.
        This observed contralateral effect was not limited to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX>, in that coadministration of adenoviral vectors
        expressing soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1</ENAMEX> and soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF receptors</ENAMEX> also
        conferred a similar protective effect to untreated knees.
        Although the mechanism of the contralateral effect is
        unclear, we have demonstrated that adoptive transfer of
        dendritic cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated with
        adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX> to untreated
        immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is able to confer a therapeutic effect
        (unpublished data). Thus, it is possible that local
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF inhibitors</ENAMEX> modulates
        the activity of dendritic cells. However, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v-IL-10</ENAMEX>
        is able to block early-stage disease, it is ineffective in
        reversing established disease. In contrast, periarticular
        injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 was able to reverse pathology in
        established disease not only in the treated hind paws, but
        also in the untreated front paws. Interestingly, we have
        observed that intravenous injection of naÃ¯ve dendritic
        cells, genetically modified to express <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>, is able to
        effectively treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">established arthritis</ENAMEX> by inhibiting the
        Th1 response (unpublished data).
        During the preparation of this manuscript, a similar
        study using a recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 vector for treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine CIA</ENAMEX> was reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. However, the vector was
        administered before onset of disease into knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>,
        whereas the vector in the present study was injected after
        disease onset into ankle joints. Similar to the present
        results, in that study local injection of the recombinant
        Ad-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mIL</NUMEX>-4 vector resulted in a reduction in bone erosion and
        a reduction in cartilage degradation. However, unlike the
        present results, no effect on joint inflammation was
        observed. Moreover, in the present report we demonstrated
        that both local and systemic injection resulted in
        induction of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>. Given the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IL-4</NUMEX> to
        reverse established disease partially, our studies, as well
        as those of others, support the potential application of
        IL-4 gene therapy for the clinical treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
