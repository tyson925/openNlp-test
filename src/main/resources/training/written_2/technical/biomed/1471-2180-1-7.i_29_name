        FtsZ assembles into protofilaments in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], and these are thought to form the cytoskeletal
        framework of the bacterial cell division machine of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is homologous to
        tubulin, and the orientation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> subunits in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilament</ENAMEX> can be deduced by comparing the atomic
        structures of tubulin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. If the tubulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> is thought of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as a cube</NUMEX>, it would have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> faces.
        The top and bottom faces of the subunit, which we call
        longitudinal, contact subunits above and below it in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilament</ENAMEX>; the right and left faces, which we call
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lateral</ENAMEX>, contact subunits in adjacent protofilaments; and
        the front and back faces correspond to the outside and
        inside of the microtubule. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> protofilament
        appears to be a homolog of the tubulin protofilament [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>] we will use these same designations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX>.
        To identify amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> critical for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> function, we
        constructed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> mutations, mostly changing conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aspartate</ENAMEX> and glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> to alanine. Initially we
        selected amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> for mutation based on conservation
        across different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but after the atomic structure of
        FtsZ was determined [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] we designed other mutations to
        target specific structural questions. The main focus of the
        present study was to characterize the in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but we also did a
        preliminary survey of their in vivo function by testing
        their ability to complement the temperature sensitive
        mutant 
        ftsZ84. 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than a dozen</NUMEX> mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> have been
        characterized in previous studies. We include these
        previously characterized mutations in our analysis of the
        structurally important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Expression of mutant proteins
          We made <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16</NUMEX> site directed mutants of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli FtsZ</ENAMEX>. The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          mutated were all exposed on the surface, and their
          positions are mapped on the atomic structure of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methanococcus FtsZ in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Their
          locations are also indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were expressed in the pET expression system,
          where all gave medium or high levels of expression. Some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were partly or largely insoluble when expressed
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BL21</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>), but all were soluble when expressed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant BL21</ENAMEX> strain C41 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          Since we were mutating only surface-exposed charged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, we expected that the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> would fold
          normally. One mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E274A</TIMEX> was completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, GTPase activity and in vivo
          function. Gel filtration and sedimentation showed that
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was aggregated, and the loss of activity may
          be a consequence of this aggregation, rather than the
          specific location of the mutation. E274A is not included
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1or Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The best evidence that the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are properly folded is that every one of
          them assembled in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran into
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> recognizable by electron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          In vivo complementation tests
          A complementation system consisting of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> strain JFL101 ( 
          ftsZ84 (ts)) and plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pBS58</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>] was used to test the ability of our mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZs</ENAMEX> to
          support cell division. JFL101 carries the temperature
          sensitive 
          ftsZ84 mutation at the genomic
          locus, and is unable to divide at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX>, although it can
          grow and divide normally at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>. pBS58 is a very low
          copy plasmid carrying a genomic fragment containing 
          ftsQ , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ftsA</ENAMEX> and 
          ftsZ , and all of the relevant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. This supplies a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3</ENAMEX> fold excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> (and
          also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FtsQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsA</ENAMEX>) and complements 
          ftsZ84, permitting cell growth and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX> when carried in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JFL101</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
          Each of our mutations was transferred from pET into
          the 
          ftsZ gene of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX>. These mutants
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX> were tested for the ability to complement the 
          ftsZ84 (ts) mutation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JFL101</TIMEX>,
          supporting growth and division when grown in liquid LB
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> NaCl with <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 μg/mL spectinomycin.</ENAMEX> Cells
          that showed prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filamentation</ENAMEX> and inability to
          generate a turbid culture after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> growth at 42°C
          were designated non-complementing. The results of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX> tests are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          We used quantitative western blotting to check the
          level of expression from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pBS58</TIMEX> plasmid (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> found that the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> expression was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> at both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 and 42°C</TIMEX>. pBS58
          with wild type 
          ftsZ caused a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>- to fivefold
          increase in total FtsZ levels when transformed into
          MC1000 or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JFL101</TIMEX>, consistent with the previous report [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]. pBS58 carrying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the benign mutations caused a
          similar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold increase in total FtsZ. These plasmids
          all complemented the temperature sensitive 
          ftsZ84 mutation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JFL101</TIMEX>. However,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> mutants that failed to complement showed total FtsZ
          levels approximately equal to that from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> without
          pBS58, implying that expression from the plasmid was
          severely reduced.
          The failure to complement 
          ftsZ84 at the non-restrictive
          temperature can therefore be attributed to the low
          expression, but the important question is why the
          expression has been so reduced. A likely explanation is
          that these mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZs</ENAMEX> are toxic at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, so that the
          only clones obtained are ones that have altered the pBS58
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> to reduce expression. Consistent with this,
          clones of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pBS58</NUMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D96A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D166K/F268V</ENAMEX> showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">aberrant Z</ENAMEX>-ring formation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E250K/D253K</ENAMEX> showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragility</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysis</ENAMEX>. This suggests that the mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is expressed at a low level, and it has a toxic
          effect.
          That wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ftsZ</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> benign mutants gave
          substantial expression from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX>, while expression was
          repressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> non-complementing mutants, suggests
          that many or all of the latter have dominant negative
          effects. These results also point to the limitations of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the JFL101</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pBS58</NUMEX>) system to characterize phenotypes of
          mutant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ftsZ</ENAMEX> . This plasmid uses the
          endogenous 
          ftsZ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, which are
          constitutively activated and may be subject to repression
          by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> site mutations. To fully characterize the in
          vivo phenotypes, we are turning to a system where
          expression of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can be repressed for
          cloning, and induced at controlled levels for phenotypic
          examination. We will also test whether the mutant 
          ftsZ s can support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> in an 
          ftsZ null. These studies are in
          progress to resolve the present uncertainty of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the JFL101</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pBS58</NUMEX>) system.
        
        
          In vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> and assembly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1summarizes</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> and assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>
          of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are also included for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> characterized in previous studies.
          GTPase activity was characterized for the purified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEMK6.5</ENAMEX>, where wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FtsZ</ENAMEX> had a GTPase
          activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> mol GDP per mol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FtsZ</ENAMEX> per min [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant proteins</ENAMEX> is expressed as a percent of
          the wild type activity. Entries followed by a letter in
          parentheses are data from other studies (the letter
          indicates the reference, see footnote to the table).
          FtsZ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> was tested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MEMK6.5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/ml FtsZ, 2</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM GTP</ENAMEX> or GDP, and either no polycation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM calcium,
          or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.06</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml DEAE dextran. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> was assayed
          by negative stain electron microscopy, and the type of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymers</ENAMEX> assembled is indicated for each condition [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>].
          We need to recall that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> formed by wild
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">type FtsZ</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> depend on the
          relative concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> and polycation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>].
          At <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/ml FtsZ</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml DEAE dextran gives sheets of
          straight protofilaments, whereas with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml DEAE
          dextran the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> were mostly helical tubes. We have
          speculated that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml DEAE dextran, hydrolysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> may occur before the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> are fully formed and
          rigidified, allowing the GDP-FtsZ to adopt the curved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml DEAE dextran on the other
          hand, straight protofilaments may be associated into
          sheets faster than hydrolysis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> contacts in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX> may prevent the protofilaments from adopting
          the curved conformation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> in GDP plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran is very reproducible, giving only helical
          tubes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
          The mutations are grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes, based on
          their ability to complement 
          ftsZ84 and their location on the
          3-D structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Benign mutations
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1lists</ENAMEX> benign mutations, which
          complement 
          ftsZ84 and are therefore functional
          in cell division. These mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> also showed
          normal assembly in our in vitro assay. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D269A</TIMEX> had
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10%</NUMEX> of the wild type GTPase activity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> previously
          characterized mutation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A70T</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FtsZ1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A81V/</ENAMEX>F268C
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FtsZ100</NUMEX>), have comparably reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> in vitro, but
          appear to be fully functional for cell division.
          Most of the benign mutations are located on the front
          or back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> subunit, i.e., the faces
          corresponding to the outside or inside of the microtubule
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). This suggests that even highly conserved amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> on these surfaces may not be crucial for function
          in cell division.
        
        
          Mutations of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that contact GTP
          Several of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> had substantially reduced
          GTPase activity in vitro, failed to complement 
          ftsZ84 , and mapped on the 3-D
          structure in direct contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>. Table 1also
          lists several mutation with similar characteristics
          characterized in other studies. G105S (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FtsZ84</NUMEX>) and D212G
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FtsZ2</NUMEX>) were able to function in cell division but had
          temperature sensitive and other phenotypes, so were not
          listed with benign mutations.
          
          ftsZ85 is temperature sensitive for
          Z-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring assembly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], but neither
          its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in vitro showed any temperature
          sensitivity. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Boer et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] reported that the
          GTPase activity was essentially the same at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 37</TIMEX> and
          44°C. Our in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> showed the same products
          assembled at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C and 42°C</TIMEX> (data not shown). FtsZ84
          produced normal sheets of straight protofilaments in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/ml DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran, but they were abnormal in also
          producing sheets at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml DEAE dextran (with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>). In
          fact, the sheets formed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FtsZ84</TIMEX> were exceptionally
          large and well ordered (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tubes</ENAMEX> could be obtained
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in GDP, but it seems that when assembled in
          GTP the impaired hydrolysis favors the straight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>. We have not yet examined FtsZ84 for
          assembly of protofilaments in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> and protofilament
          sheets in calcium.
          A cluster of mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N207, D209, D212</ENAMEX>) strongly
          affecting GTPase activity are located on the opposite
          side of the subunit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). This short
          strand of polypeptide, which we call the "synergy" loop,
          apparently contacts the GTP molecule of the subunit
          beneath it in the protofilament and contributes essential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> to the hydrolysis mechanism. (See [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 18</ENAMEX>] for
          an expanded discussion of this hypothesis and references
          to mutants of tubulin that map to this loop.)
          D209A showed a novel assembly form. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, or in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 mM GTP</TIMEX> (which also chelates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX>), the
          D209A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> assembled into protofilament bundles that
          formed long spirals or closed circular hoops (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3d,e).
          Both the spirals and the hoops were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 120 to 150</NUMEX> nm
          in diameter. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> seem to be closely related
          to each other, with the hoops being formed when the
          protofilament ends join after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> turn. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 mM GMPCPP</TIMEX>, a
          slowly hydrolyzable analog of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D209A</TIMEX> assembled a
          mixture of hoops and tubes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3f).
          D212A was also tested in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 mM GMPCPP</TIMEX>, where it made
          only tubes in most circumstances. However, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran it made some twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">protofilaments</ENAMEX>, which were
          quite straight. D209A could also make straight, single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilaments</ENAMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran, while
          D212A could not. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> assembled bundles of
          straight protofilaments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> mM calcium. This
          demonstrates that the synergy loop mutants can make
          straight protofilaments under certain conditions.
          However, the synergy loop mutants and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D45A</ENAMEX> seem highly
          shifted toward the curved conformation, even when
          assembled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMPCPP</ENAMEX>.
          D45 is close to and probably contacts the γ-phosphate
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>, and was the most severe of this group of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. The alanine substitution reduced the in vitro
          GTPase activity to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of wild type and appeared to
          eliminate the ability to form straight protofilaments,
          either alone or with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml DEAE dextran. This mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could still assemble into curved protofilaments
          and form tubes.
        
        
          Mutations on the protofilament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutations</ENAMEX>)
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of mutants mapped to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the
          subunits, which we originally believed to be the surfaces
          that bond protofilaments to each other in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilament</ENAMEX> sheets (see Discussion). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these
          were part of our original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of mutations, changing
          conserved asp or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glu residues</ENAMEX> to ala. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> others were
          designed to make very disruptive changes in the presumed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lateral</ENAMEX> contacts, changing D166 to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S245</TIMEX> to F, and
          constructing a double mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E250K/D253K.</ENAMEX> E250 and D253
          are adjacent to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the highly
          conserved sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLL</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>/E).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutants</ENAMEX> had mostly normal GTPase activity,
          which was expected since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> is thought to be
          triggered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> into protofilaments, which does not
          involve the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral surfaces</ENAMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
          surprises with these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutants</ENAMEX>. First, they gave
          mostly normal in vitro assembly of both sheets and tubes,
          in contrast to our design goal to disrupt lateral
          interactions of protofilaments. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, all of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutants</ENAMEX> were incapable of complementing the 
          ftsZ84 mutation. These points are
          addressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discussion</ENAMEX>.
          D86K had an interesting assembly property, in that it
          showed a strong tendency to assemble into tubes. In the
          complete absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D86K</TIMEX> assembled into
          tubes in GDP or without added nucleotide (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b). In
          fact, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D86K</TIMEX> was largely assembled into tubes when released
          from the expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. In the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>,
          D86K formed a mixture of tubes and straight twin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilament</ENAMEX> pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3c). Wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FtsZ</ENAMEX> also formed
          twin protofilaments, but their occurrence was exaggerated
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D86K</TIMEX>. D86K could also form protofilament sheets when
          assembled in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran, as could all of the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). D166K had a lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> and
          did not assemble as well, but this may have been due to
          problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein purification</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          High GTPase is not essential for cell
          division
          Several mutations reduce the GTPase activity to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>
          of wild type as measured in vitro, yet can still support
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. Best studied is 
          ftsZ84 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">G105S</NUMEX>), which has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10%</NUMEX>
          of the GTPase activity of wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FtsZ</ENAMEX> over the entire
          range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> to 44°C [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 19</TIMEX>]. In spite of this greatly
          reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> in vitro, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FtsZ84</ENAMEX> can function for cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, and also at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX> when over-expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3</ENAMEX> fold [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>], or when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ZipA</ENAMEX> is overexpressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. FtsZ2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D212G</NUMEX>) has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>-fold lower GTPase than wild
          type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], yet it can support division when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> (however, this division occurs with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mini</ENAMEX>-cell phenotype at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysis occurs at
          42°C) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. FtsZ1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A70T</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FtsZ100</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A81V/F268C</ENAMEX> - it is
          apparently the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A81V</NUMEX> substitution that reduces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX>,
          since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F268C</TIMEX> has near wild type activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]) have about
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> wild type GTPase activity and can support cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Our present study has identified one
          additional mutant, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D269A</TIMEX>, that is capable of supporting
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, but has lost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of its GTPase activity.
          Most of these mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> seem to have normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX> in vitro.
          The ability of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> mutants to function in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> is surprising, and raises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possibilities. One
          is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis may be substantially moderated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX>. For example, the polymer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in vivo (still
          unknown) might impose a new rate-limiting step in
          hydrolysis, which is lower even than the hydrolysis rate
          of the mutants in vitro. Alternatively, the GTPase
          activity in vitro may be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times higher than actually
          needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments will be needed
          to address this question further.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curved</ENAMEX> and straight protofilaments, and mutations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">contacting GTP</ENAMEX>
          In a recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] we found that FtsZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilaments</ENAMEX> could adopt either a straight or curved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>. The straight conformation was seen in
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protofilaments</ENAMEX> assembled from purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> or the slowly hydrolyzable analog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMPCPP</ENAMEX>, and in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilament</ENAMEX> sheets assembled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curved</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX> generated tubular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX>, which
          were assembled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran and GDP. We concluded
          that the straight and curved conformations were favored
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> and GDP, respectively.
          We therefore expected that mutations that severely
          blocked GTP hydrolysis would assemble tubes in GDP, but
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> would give only straight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilaments</ENAMEX>. All of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> formed tubes in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran and GDP, as expected. The
          straight conformation was preferred for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G105S</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FtsZ84</NUMEX>) in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran, also as expected. However, the
          other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> GTP-contact mutants (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D45A, D209A, D212A</ENAMEX>)
          preferred to make tubes even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>. This did not agree
          with our initial expectations that reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis
          would lock the protofilaments into the straight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>.
          A recent paper has proposed that hydrolysis of GTP
          results in a substantial movement of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> loop, and
          suggested that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> might be involved in the
          transition to the curved conformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. D45 is
          adjacent to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> loop, so removal of its side chain
          might permit movements similar to those that occur when
          the γ-phosphate is removed. The positions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D209</ENAMEX> and
          D212 are less certain, but they are likely close to or in
          contact with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> loop of the adjacent subunit. We
          suggest the hypothesis that removal of any of the side
          chains in this region may permit movement of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX> loop
          into the GDP conformation, similar to removal of the
          γ-phosphate.
        
        
          The mystery of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> contacts
          Our initial goal in making the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutants</ENAMEX> was to
          target amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> making lateral contacts between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilaments</ENAMEX>. We expected some of these mutants to
          disrupt assembly of sheets and/or tubes, and we would
          then be able to test whether they also disrupted cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protofilament</ENAMEX> sheets have not been demonstrated
          in vivo, so this could be an important test of whether
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral interactions</ENAMEX> are actually used in cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>. However, none of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutations</ENAMEX> seemed
          to affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of sheets in vitro - sheets
          assembled normally in both DEAE dextran and calcium, and
          tube <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> was also mostly normal.
          A closer examination of the atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> may
          explain why our <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutants</ENAMEX> failed to prevent
          assembly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran sheets in vitro. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilaments</ENAMEX> in both sheets and tubes assembled in DEAE
          dextran are spaced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.4</NUMEX> nm apart [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 27</TIMEX>], but the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> is not that wide. The widest aspect of the FtsZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> is seen in the front view, i.e., as presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Most of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that we mutated could
          only make contact if the subunits were spaced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> nm
          apart. The only structure that could bridge a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX> nm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spacing</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal segment, which is highly
          extended in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methanococcus FtsZ</ENAMEX> and perhaps also
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . It seems clear from the
          dimensional analysis that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> we mutated
          could not form the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> between protofilaments in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran sheets. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal helix is a likely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> contacts in these sheets.
          There is, however, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> contact
          that can assemble protofilament sheets or pairs with a
          much closer spacing. We observed a second form of
          protofilament <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX> when assembled on cationic lipid
          monolayers, in which the protofilaments were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3.7</NUMEX> nm
          apart [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Löwe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amos</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] showed pairs of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methanococcus FtsZ</ENAMEX> protofilaments
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">∼ 3.9</NUMEX> nm spacing. We believe that these sheets and
          pairs with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.9</NUMEX> nm protofilament spacing may
          assemble by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral surfaces</ENAMEX> that we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutated</ENAMEX>, and may be representative of an essential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymer</ENAMEX> in vivo.
          In view of the mostly normal in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>, it was remarkable that all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> mutants
          failed to complement 
          ftsZ84 . So far this failure to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complement</ENAMEX> has only been tested in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the JFL101</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pBS58</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, but the reduced expression of the mutant proteins
          suggests a possible dominant negative effect. These
          lateral surfaces may therefore be important for function
          in cell division. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that they could
          provide the binding sites for accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FtsA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 28, 29, 30</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZipA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32, 33</TIMEX>]
          are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to bind directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FtsZ</ENAMEX>,
          and they bind to the highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal peptide
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. An alternative is that these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> surfaces
          mediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of protofilaments with each other, to
          form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">protofilament</NUMEX> pairs or small sheets. These would
          likely correspond to the in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.9</NUMEX>
          nm spacing.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang et al.</ENAMEX>, have recently described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> site directed
          mutants of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ftsZ</ENAMEX> in 
          Caulobacter crescentus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], and
          tested them in a strain in which the genomic wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ftsZ</ENAMEX> could be fully expressed or
          completely suppressed. They targeted clusters of adjacent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, which
          were changed to alanine. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of their mutants were fully
          able to support cell division, and were listed as wild
          type in phenotype. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> were not able to support cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> and were listed as recessive-lethal. Each of
          these mutations did, however, cause significant
          disruptions in division when expressed with wild type 
          ftsZ , so they had a partially
          dominant effect. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> mutations were dominant-lethal, as
          was a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G109S</NUMEX> mutant designed to duplicate the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli ftsZ84</ENAMEX> .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these mutants are particularly relevant to our
          study. Their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DE254AA</NUMEX> includes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our E250A</TIMEX>. They listed it
          as lethal-recessive, although noting that it produced
          filamentous cells with constrictions when expressed along
          with wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ftsZ</ENAMEX> . Their ability to obtain
          transformants expressing the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> contrasts
          with our results that the only transformants we obtained
          had significantly reduced expression levels of the mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. It may be that the aberrations induced by this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were sufficient select for down-regulated
          expression from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pGS58</TIMEX> vector, or the aberrations may
          be more severe in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, demonstrate mutations can have very different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> in different species. In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caulobacter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G109S</ENAMEX> was
          dominant-lethal, while in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> the corresponding G104S( 
          ftsZ84 ) has a wild type phenotype
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30°C</TIMEX>, and can support cell division at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42°C</TIMEX> when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> site-directed mutants of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli FtsZ</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and GTPase
        activity in vitro, and for whether they can function in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> to complement 
        ftsZ84 . Mutations on the front and
        back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> protofilament were mostly benign: they had
        normal in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, and could complement 
        ftsZ84 . Several of these, however,
        had significantly reduced in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX>, demonstrating
        that the high level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> is not essential for assembly
        or function in vivo. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of mutations altered
        residues contacting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX>. These could all assemble in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran, although with some abnormalities, and they
        had < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTPase</ENAMEX>. These mutants failed
        to complement 
        ftsZ84 when expressed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX>. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> class of mutations mapped to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilaments</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral mutations</ENAMEX> did not interfere
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> nor with assembly of protofilaments, and
        surprisingly showed mostly normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran.
        We conclude that these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral surfaces</ENAMEX> are not involved in
        assembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        mutations on the right side and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> on the left failed to
        give clones that complement 
        ftsZ84 , suggesting that these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral surfaces</ENAMEX> are important for the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> in
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral surfaces</ENAMEX> may mediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association of FtsZ</ENAMEX> protofilaments into pairs or small
        sheets, although with a structure different from the in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> stabilized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> dextran.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Site-directed mutagenesis of FtsZ
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">FtsZ</ENAMEX> mutants with amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> were
          constructed by an overlap extension PCR method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. We
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> for a template, and for each mutant
          transcribed the complete 
          ftsZ sequence (adding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NdeI</ENAMEX> and
          BamHI cloning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at the ends) using error-correcting
          Pfu polymerase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] and outward-facing primers
          containing the desired mutations. Mutated 
          ftsZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were cloned into the
          pET11 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> for expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX>, permitting
          purification of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> mutants were all created originally in the
          pET expression vector. In order to test whether they
          could function in vivo, we transferred the mutations to
          the plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX> (provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Lutkenhaus</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Kansas Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>). To
          construct a pBS58 
          ftsZ mutant plasmid (pBS58 
          ftsZ mut), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> and BstEII
          fragment of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ftsZ</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX> was replaced with the
          same part of 
          ftsZ from pET- 
          ftsZ mut. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> and BstEII
          sites are not unique in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX> and pET, additional cloning
          steps were needed. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> kb HindIII fragment from pBS58
          that contains the whole 
          ftsZ gene was first subcloned into
          vector Litmus38 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>) whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> site
          has been deleted, and created a plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Litmus38</TIMEX>(RI)+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H3</NUMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcoRI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BstEII</ENAMEX> fragment with a desired mutation
          from pET- 
          ftsZ mut was put into
          Litmus38(RI)+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H3</NUMEX> precut by the same enzymes. Finally, the
          HindIII fragment from Litmus38(RI)+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H3mut</NUMEX> was ligated into
          pBS58 whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> had been removed. The
          orientation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in the resulting plasmid pBS58 
          ftsZ mut was examined by EcoRI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digestion</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> mutants were sequenced from the pET vector: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D45A,</ENAMEX>
          A70T, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D86K</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D158A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D212A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E238A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E250A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D269A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E274A</TIMEX>, and
          D299A. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> were sequenced from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pBS58</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A70T,</ENAMEX>
          D96A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D158A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D166K/F268V</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D187A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D209A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S245F</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D269A</ENAMEX> and
          E274A. In each case we sequenced <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 600-700 bp</TIMEX>
          around the mutation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> showed a change other than
          the desired mutation. D166K also contained the mutation
          F268V; since this is a conservative substitution, and
          since the similar F268C(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Z114</NUMEX>) is benign [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], we do not
          think the extra mutation is important.
        
        
          Quantitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> expression
          Bacterial cultures, including strains transformed with
          pBS58 carrying various alleles of 
          ftsZ , were either grown to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A 600</TIMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30°</NUMEX>, or grown to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A 600∼ 0.15</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30°</NUMEX>, then
          grown for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42°</NUMEX>. All cultures were grown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ 100 μg/mL</ENAMEX> spectinomycin if necessary). Harvesting
          and extraction of the cultures and quantitation of FtsZ
          levels in these extracts was carried out as described [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>], except that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> levels were compared to total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels instead of cell numbers. Total protein
          levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> extracts were determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA</ENAMEX> assay
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>) after removing the reducing reagent from SDS
          buffer by precipitating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from the extract with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          trichloroacetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, washing in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> trichloroacetic acid
          and resuspending the pellet in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N NaOH</ENAMEX>. This procedure
          recovered ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> sample
          buffer over the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentrations
          recommended for use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA</ENAMEX> assay (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Purification of FtsZ
          FtsZ mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were over-expressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BL21</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>)
          cells and purified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different approaches.
          Initially, we purified wild type and mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">two-step ammonium sulfate precipitation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          cells were suspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 mM EDTA</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSF</ENAMEX>, treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mL lysozyme and
          lysed by freeze-thaw and sonication. We have subsequently
          found that lysis in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> pressure cell gives a much
          more reproducible recovery of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and have
          used this for later preparations. We also found that
          inducing at an A 600of 1.0 rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> gave more
          soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. FtsZ was purified from the bacterial
          supernatant by discarding a precipitate at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> saturated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate</ENAMEX>, then precipitating the remaining FtsZ
          by raising the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate</ENAMEX> level to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> saturation [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. This procedure gives an excellent yield of pure,
          active wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FtsZ</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], and was used for most of the
          studies described below with no additional steps.
          We later found that some mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FtsZs</ENAMEX> were not
          efficiently precipitated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate</ENAMEX>, so we
          adopted a method using higher ammonium sulfate for the
          initial precipitation, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chromatography</ENAMEX> [
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 19</ENAMEX>]. FtsZ was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> saturation. The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein pellet</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ml of buffer A (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MgCl 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX> glycerol and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM PMSF</ENAMEX>) and dialyzed against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> ml of buffer A
          overnight. The sample was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel
          column at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> and eluted with a gradient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> KCl
          in buffer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. FtsZ</ENAMEX> eluted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M KCl</ENAMEX>, separated from a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> peak containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> was desalted
          in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MEMK6.5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MES</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> adjusted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KOH</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM Mg acetate) and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
          showed several high molecular weight contaminants in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FtsZ</TIMEX> precipitated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate</ENAMEX>, and these were
          not removed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE</ENAMEX> column. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">The 20/25%</NUMEX> ammonium
          sulfate protocol seems to give a better purification of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that can be precipitated at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, but the
          alternative protocol is important for some mutants that
          do not precipitate completely at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium sulfate</ENAMEX>.
          The following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were purified by the DEAE-Sephacel
          procedure for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> assays: A70T(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FtsZ1</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D158A</TIMEX>, D269A
          and G105S (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FtsZ84</NUMEX>).
          Wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FtsZ</ENAMEX> was usually <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX> soluble when
          expressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BL21</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were lysed with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> press. Some mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> seemed less
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soluble</ENAMEX>, giving from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5% to 40%</NUMEX> soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D45A,</ENAMEX>
          D96A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D86K</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D209A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E238A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D166K</TIMEX>, listed in increasing
          order of solubility). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, when the pET plasmids
          were expressed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli C41</ENAMEX>, a modified BL21(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>], <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D45A</TIMEX> was expressed at a lower level but was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soluble</ENAMEX>, and all other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were expressed at a high
          level and were ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> soluble.
        
        
          In vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron microscopy</ENAMEX> and GTPase
          assay
          All in vitro assays were done in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MEMK6.5</NUMEX> buffer.
          Assembly reactions contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FtsZ</ENAMEX> (determined by
          our calibrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 mM GTP</TIMEX> or GDP and
          variable concentrations of DEAE-dextran or calcium. The
          reaction mixture was incubated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-10 min</TIMEX>, then
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>, and negatively stained electron
          microscope specimens were prepared.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> in calcium was tested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> lysed
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">supernatants</ENAMEX>, by adding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM and calcium
          chloride to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM. The sample was brought to room
          temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> min. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FtsZ polymers</ENAMEX> was
          initially indicated by formation of a gel, and negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stain electron microscopy</ENAMEX> confirmed a network of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protofilament</ENAMEX> sheets in most of these gelled samples (in
          some the background obscured any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>). The most
          decisive indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> was obtained by
          centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> × g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> min. This pelleted a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gelled samples</ENAMEX>, whereas without
          calcium nothing was pelleted.
          GTPase activity was assayed as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>] with some modifications. Briefly, the reaction was
          started by adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> μl of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μCi</NUMEX> {α-
          32P<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">} GTP</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> Ci/mmol, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 μl</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ</ENAMEX> in
          MEMK6.5 and incubated immediately at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>. To terminate
          the reaction, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 μl</NUMEX> of the reaction mixture was withdrawn
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every three minutes</TIMEX> and mixed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 μl</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.0</NUMEX> (this is an important modification
          of our previous protocol, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> stops GTP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrolysis</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> microliter of this mixture was applied
          to a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer
          chromatography plate and developed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M KH</ENAMEX> 2PO 4.
          GDP produced was determined and the GTPase activity was
          expressed as mols GDP per mol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FtsZ per min. GTPase</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were scaled as a percent of wild type,
          which was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.5 mols GTP</NUMEX> per mol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FtsZ</ENAMEX> per min.
