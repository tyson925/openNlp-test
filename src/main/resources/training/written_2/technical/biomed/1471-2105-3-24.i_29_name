        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> believed that point mutations
        in genes are the genetic switches for somatic and inherited
        diseases such as cystic fibrosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenylketonuria</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. For this to be the case, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-associated amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> should occur in functionally important
        regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> of genes. While it has been
        shown in specific cases that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-associated amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        substitutions affect protein function, until now few
        studies have examined this across many genes. Here we
        provide direct evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-associated point
        mutations occur in functionally important regions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> and are not distributed equally across the coding
        regions of genes. This work supports recent efforts to
        collect disease associated mutational data in databases and
        suggests that many of the mutations represented in those
        databases are the likely underlying molecular cause of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        Recently there have been a number of commercial and
        public projects aimed at collecting and understanding human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> variation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The goal of these projects is to
        provide an understanding of how genotype is associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, how it affects our response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and how it
        affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> of genes. Examples of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP Consortium</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> Genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutation Database</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , many gene specific databases ( [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , for example), and both public and private genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> efforts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Much of the data that is being
        collected are mutations annotated with their observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Automated annotation methods based on structural
        and evolutionary parameters can lead to insight into the
        molecular basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4,000,000</NUMEX> identified variations and with
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> of them annotated with a phenotype, we are
        facing the problem of having many uncharacterized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. Algorithms are needed for automatically
        annotating these gene variations to gain insight into how
        they affect the gene's regulation and/or function of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX>. Using many collection technologies,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncharacterized SNP</ENAMEX> data is being placed in public
        databases such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Human Genome Mutation Database</ENAMEX> (over
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> entries) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGAP-GAI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Genome Anatomy Project Genetic</ENAMEX> Annotation
        Initiative) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGAP-GAI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,243</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> by examining publicly available <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> (Expressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence Tag</ENAMEX>) chromatograms.
        Software for analyzing unannotated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in known disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be especially useful when previously
        unobserved mutations are discovered. Every human has
        genotypic differences from the standard genome
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every thousand</TIMEX> base pairs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Given
        knowledge of how a genotype differs from the standard, it
        is important to be able to predict which of the variations
        are likely to be the cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or other phenotypic
        differences. Evolutionary information about regulatory and
        coding regions of genes can be used to highlight certain
        mutations or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of mutations that are attributable to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Early tools using phylogenetic and structural
        information have shown promise in predicting the functional
        consequences of a mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . These reports predict
        that anywhere between <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-36%</NUMEX> of non-synonymous SNPs alter
        the function of a gene's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein product</ENAMEX>. In the report by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chasman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, evolutionary information was predicted
        to be a useful component in determining whether a mutation
        is deleterious [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . Disease causing mutations are
        also likely structurally perturbing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henikoff</ENAMEX> have introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SIFT</ENAMEX>, a method for
        predicting functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> from a database of unannotated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        The relationship between disease-associated mutation
        positions and evolutionary conservation has been reported
        in specific cases. An analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> susceptibility gene, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BRCA1</TIMEX>, showed that
        disease-associated mutations tend to occur in highly
        conserved regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . An analysis of homologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen receptor</ENAMEX> has shown similar
        results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Keratin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, KRT12</TIMEX>, is associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meesmann Corneal Epithelial Dystrophy</ENAMEX> (MCD). Reported
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> often occur in the highly conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-helix-initiation motif of rod domain 1A or in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-helix-termination motif of rod domain 2B [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Structure based analysis methods have also been used to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyze Osteogenesis</ENAMEX> imperfecta associated COL1A1 mutations
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-associated P53 mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mooney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished), [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller and Kumar</ENAMEX> have reported that
        disease-associated mutations are conserved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> model
        genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        To determine the degree to which mutation positions
        differ evolutionarily from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>, we have built
        alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous genes</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> disease-associated
        genes. These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple alignments</ENAMEX> have then been used to
        assess the difference in evolutionary conservation for
        positions that are both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-associated and not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX>. The results show that, in general, positions
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-associated mutations are conserved more than
        the average position in the alignment. This suggests the
        most conserved mutations are likely to be the causative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and our data set identifies these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Our method compares the negative entropy of
        disease-associated columns within an alignment to other
        columns in that alignment. The goal of this work is to
        build these alignments, map the mutations to them, and show
        that disease-associated positions are, in general,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. The analysis was performed on the built
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> and the results are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        To collect the mutation data, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were used for
        the analysis. They were chosen because they had a reported
        cDNA sequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-associated mutations and homologs in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISSPROT</ENAMEX>. These genes are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> consists of all the homologs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISSPROT</ENAMEX> as
        determined by a BLAST search with an e-value threshold of
        10e-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>. For each alignment the negative entropy for each
        column was calculated.
        The conservation ratio parameter is defined as the
        average negative entropy of analyzable positions with
        reported mutations divided by the average negative entropy
        of every analyzable position in the gene sequence. Analysis
        was performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6185</TIMEX> mutations and of those
        we found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84.0%</NUMEX> had conservation ratios <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX>.
        From those, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than ten</NUMEX> analyzable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> and, of those, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88.0%</NUMEX> had conservation ratios less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
        Use of evolutionary information is a promising approach
        to automated characterization of mutations. These results
        show that although conservation alone is not a perfect
        predictive measure, there is useful information contained
        in sequence alignments containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous genes</ENAMEX>.
        Approaches using conservation in a multiple alignment
        should work better when associated with other methods such
        as structural analysis, population analysis and
        experimental data. Knowledge of how the sequence pool
        clusters into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> may increase the sensitivity of the
        method.
        Our measured parameter, the conservation ratio, is a
        quantity that measures the usefulness of a multiple
        alignment for characterizing mutations in a gene sequence.
        Knowledge of more mutations in a gene does not necessarily
        lower the conservation ratio. We expect that knowledge of
        more mutations in a gene will increase the statistical
        significance of the conservation ratio. This is the likely
        underlying cause of the result showing that genes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        or mutations increases are more likely to have a
        conservation ratio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX>.
        The alignments and BLAST searches are integrated on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">website, http://</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stanford</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/mut-paper/.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, there are estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>
        non-synonymous differences between an individual and the
        draft <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 5 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Determination of which
        positions are likely to be disease associated is a
        challenging and important problem. The finding that
        disease-associated mutations occur in positions of
        functional importance supports recent efforts for the
        building of methods to predict which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> are likely
        to be disease associated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 13 16 17</NUMEX> ] . These methods
        are likely to incorporate protein structure, the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        identity of the mutation and phylogenetic information. In
        an interesting twist, this observation also suggests that
        this data may be useable as a functional genomics tool for
        understanding the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> of genes
        on a molecular level. Such a method would use the inherent
        functional information contained in a phenotypically
        annotated polymorphism to infer functional importance
        within a gene.
      
      
        Methods
        Non-synonymous mutations were acquired from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genome Mutation Database</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://archive.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uwcm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/uwcm/mg/hgmd0.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">231</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        were chosen with known disease-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> each having
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISSPROT</ENAMEX> homologs, a cDNA sequence and mutations in the
        coding region. For each of those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, all known
        non-synonymous mutations were then downloaded with the cDNA
        sequence for that gene.
        Each cDNA sequence was then translated and placed in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTA</ENAMEX> formatted file. For each of the resultant files a
        BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] search was performed against the SwissProt
        database. All sequences from the returned hits were then
        stored in FASTA format files. For each of the genes that
        returned BLAST results with e-value scores smaller than
        1e-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ClustalW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] was used to build a sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX>.
        For each amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in the position of interest, the
        negative entropy was determined using the following formula
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] :
        
        Where the P 
        i are the probabilities of finding a
        particular amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> at that position. For this analysis,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gapped</ENAMEX> positions, "-", were considered independent amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        For each known mutation, the negative entropy of the
        column it occupies was tabulated. The average negative
        entropy for each mutation within a gene was compared to the
        average entropy of all columns satisfying the criteria for
        analysis. Mutations outside of the coding region or
        mutations encoding termination codons were discarded.
        The list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was then sorted by average negative
        entropy of the mutations. We then calculated the
        conservation entropy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CE</ENAMEX>, using:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CE</ENAMEX> = average NE of mutation positions/average NE of all
        positions in the gene sequence
