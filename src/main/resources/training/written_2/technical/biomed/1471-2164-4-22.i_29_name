        The initial publication of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> draft versions of the
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> led to intense debate over the exact number of
        genes in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Current estimates
        suggest that the human genome encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 35,000</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38,000</NUMEX> although the final number must await the complete
        annotation of each genome sequence. The search for
        additional genes not discovered during early annotation
        attempts has involved the use of several different
        approaches. These have included the sequencing of randomly
        selected cDNAs from various tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, the development
        of computer-based prediction programs of ever-increasing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accuracy</ENAMEX>, and the direct comparison between the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> and the genome sequences of other vertebrates and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invertebrates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Using these approaches,
        fully annotated genomes of numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will be
        available within a relatively short time.
        We approached the problem of gene identification by
        using a combination of experimental and 
        in silico techniques. Specifically,
        we initiated a project designed to sequence expressed
        sequence tags from the hamster testis and used these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to identify unannotated, or incompletely
        annotated, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the human and other vertebrate genomes.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hamster</ENAMEX> has not been used extensively in genomics
        research; however, it has been used extensively in various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of investigation including circadian rhythm research
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and also in investigations in a number of areas of
        research in reproductive biology. For example, the study of
        hamster gametes has revealed significant information
        concerning the mechanisms underlying species-specific
        sperm-egg interactions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] and the deleterious
        effects of endocrine disruptors on male and female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . The hamster,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> are all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muridae</ENAMEX>,
        however both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and rats belong to the subfamily Murinae
        while hamsters belong to the subfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cricetinae</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
        hamster <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that are commonly used in research are 
        Mesocricetus auratus (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> golden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hamster</ENAMEX>), 
        Cricetulus griseus (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hamster</ENAMEX>)
        and 
        Phodopus sungorus (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Siberian hamster</NUMEX>).
        Therefore, sequence information from any hamster species
        should complement information gained from other closely
        related species.
        The testis was chosen for these studies as it represents
        a viable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for the identification of novel genes. The
        adult testis is a complex organ consisting of numerous
        different somatic cell types as well as germ cells at all
        stages of spermatogenesis from the gonocyte stem cells to
        the mature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Consequently, several
        unique gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, including those involved in the
        regulation of meiosis, as well as those specific to the
        various testicular cell types, are expressed in the testis.
        A recent gene discovery study performed in the testis of 
        Drosophila melanogaster found that
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> of greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> sequenced cDNAs did not match to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> previously identified in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Likewise the testis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cynomolgus monkey</ENAMEX> has yielded
        several novel gene sequences [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, we
        reasoned that the sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from hamster testis
        might reveal the existence of novel genes conserved in
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that may function in controlling testicular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and/or function. In this report, we describe
        our initial results from the sequencing of
        randomly-selected cDNAs from the testes of male <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> hamsters. In particular we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cDNAs
        that appear to be derived from genes that were not
        previously annotated in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. We describe the
        detailed analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these genes, which encode a new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based
        molecular motors and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> likely to be involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> remodeling.
      
      
        Results
        
          Generation and sequence analysis of a Hamster
          testis cDNA library
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX> clones from a hamster testis cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> were
          selected and sequenced as described in materials and
          methods. The sequences were screened to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and vector sequences, which yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">735</NUMEX> distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The sequence of each clone was compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in public databases to identify its closest
          match. Each sequence was then assigned to a functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> based on this comparison (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          distributed amongst all of the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> listed
          with the highest numbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> and degradation (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>), metabolism (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>),
          gene regulation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX>) and intracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>). Overall, the data set contains examples
          of numerous testis-specific genes as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
          display less limited patterns of expression.
          We next considered the overall complexity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in our database as our cloning strategy made it
          possible to obtain multiple fragments from the same cDNA.
          We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 40</NUMEX> instances where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> was derived from the same gene (data not shown).
          In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 17</NUMEX> fragments appeared <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than two</TIMEX>
          times in the database and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 6</NUMEX> fragments appeared more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times. The most common sequences were derived
          from genes that are known to be highly expressed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testis</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and include heat shock protein
          90A [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , chitobiase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , outer dense fiber of
          sperm tails [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and kinectin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the
          majority of sequences were represented only once or at
          most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times in the data set. The fact that most
          sequences were not identified multiple times suggests
          that we have not exhaustively sequenced all of the 
          DpnII fragments from cDNAs
          expressed in the hamster testis. This is not surprising
          as conservative estimates suggest that there are many
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of unique transcripts expressed in the various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">somatic</ENAMEX> and germ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lineages</ENAMEX> in the testis.
          The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of sequences identified in this
          project falls into the functionally unclassified group
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> includes a small number of named
          genes for which no function has yet been assigned but
          primarily contains the results of full-length cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> projects or genes predicted by gene finding
          software. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> of these clones (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> out
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">239</NUMEX>) were originally isolated from testis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>,
          suggesting that a large number of genes remain to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionally</ENAMEX> characterized in the testis.
        
        
          Identification of novel testis specific
          genes
          
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1030</TIMEX>: A new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the kinesin
            superfamily
            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1030</TIMEX> clone contained an ORF of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
            that displayed similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the kinesin
            superfamily of molecular motors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
            analysis using the hamster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1030</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> detected a single
            band in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">testis RNA</ENAMEX> and weak signals in several other
            tissues including brain, heart and lung (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
            Comparison of the hamster nucleotide sequence with
            genomic sequences revealed highly significant matches
            within chromosomal positions 9q21.33 in human, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13B2</TIMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. Partial cDNAs from human and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macaque</ENAMEX> also mapped to the same genetic locus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Using the procedures described in materials and
            methods we mapped an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> exon gene that was followed by
            a consensus polyadenylation signal in the human, mouse
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat genome</ENAMEX> sequences (figure 3A). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exon 1</ENAMEX> is located
            within a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">CpG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, indicating the likely
            presence of a promoter in this region. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> cloning of
            the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> was employed to confirm the exonic
            structure predicted by the genomic sequences. These
            studies revealed the existence of three alternatively
            spliced products, one containing all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> coding exons
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 1</ENAMEX> is non-coding) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> lacking either
            exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> or exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 13</TIMEX> (figures 3Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3C</ENAMEX>).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conceptual</ENAMEX> translation of the predicted full-length
            human mRNA revealed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1401</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX> that is
            highly conserved in macaque, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> (figures
            2and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Database searches revealed that it encodes a
            previously unreported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the kinesin
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX>. The kinesin superfamily in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
            is comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, designated with
            the prefix <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Based on this naming system we
            have assigned the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIF27</ENAMEX> to this new family member
            with the suffixes A, B and C to designate the splice
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> described above (figure 3B). Domain mapping
            within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIF27</TIMEX> revealed an amino terminal kinesin motor
            domain and a putative topisomerase domain located in
            the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (figure 2and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3B</ENAMEX>). Phylogenic
            analysis revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIF27</ENAMEX> belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-5
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIFs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , which includes mouse
            KIF21A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">21B</ENAMEX>, and human KIF4 (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> also known as
            the chromokinesins). Comparisons with the other members
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-5</ENAMEX> subgroup revealed greatest similarity within
            the motor domain (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47-50%</NUMEX> identity) (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In
            addition, the sequence of the neck domain of KIF27
            located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end of the motor domain
            conformed to the consensus sequence for the neck domain
            of chromokinesins (figure 3B) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7012</TIMEX>
            This clone contained an ORF of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that
            detected a strong signal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blotting in testis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Genome analysis permitted the mapping
            of a common set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> exons on human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and rat
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosomes 5</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 2</TIMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>),
            assembly of which resulted in translation products of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">579</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">555 and 563</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, respectively (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
            These predictions were also corroborated by a macaque
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AB070167</NUMEX>). The encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> did not contain
            any recognizable functional motifs (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and were
            most similar to an uncharacterized human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> named
            B29 (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). B29 was originally identified as a gene
            located on human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18q21</NUMEX> in a search for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">candidate tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor proteins in lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
            However, the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B29</ENAMEX> is unknown and it does not
            contain any obvious functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>. Interestingly,
            the apparent size of the detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> is significantly
            larger than that of the assembled sequences, suggesting
            that additional exons are likely to remain to be
            discovered. In this regard, gene prediction software
            identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 35</NUMEX> exons in the mouse genomic
            sequence that were partly conserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> but not
            present in the human sequence. Final mapping of the
            genomic structure of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7012</TIMEX> will await further refineme
            nt of each genomic sequence.
          
          
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9004</TIMEX>
            This clone encoded an ORF of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that did
            not display significant similarity to any known
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in public databases. Northern blotting
            revealed a specific signal in hamster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">testis RNA</ENAMEX>
            (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The clone sequence mapped to human
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 1p13.3</ENAMEX>, mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3F3</NUMEX> and rat
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> and macaque cDNAs have
            recently appeared in the database that encompass this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> and the sequences of their encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
            compared in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. These polypeptides contain a
            predicted coiled coil <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) but do not
            contain other functional domains that might indicate
            their possible function(s).
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13043</NUMEX>
            This clone encodes an ORF of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that did
            not display significant similarity to known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
            Northern blotting revealed a strong signal in testis
            (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Genome comparisons revealed matches on
            human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> and rat
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> coding
            sequences were assembled using a macaque cDNA
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AB070087</NUMEX>) as template (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Domain mapping
            identified several conserved transmembrane domains in
            each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as well as a putative cyclic nucleotide
            binding site close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In
            addition a putative cation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> was identified in
            the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Further analysis will be
            necessary to determine whether this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> functions
            as a regulatable cation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.

            This clone encodes an ORF of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> whose
            mRNA was specifically detected in hamster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">testis RNA</ENAMEX>
            (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Genome comparisons revealed strong
            similarities with regions of human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, mouse
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> and rat chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This clone
            matches to hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> recently added to the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BAB63125</NUMEX>). The alignment in figure 9accounts for
            each of these clones as well as additional exons
            predicted in the mouse from inter-genome comparisons.
            The encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> contains several predicted
            coiled-coil regions but no other identifiable
            functional domains (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15018</NUMEX>
            This clone encodes an ORF of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that
            detected a specific signal in hamster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">testis RNA</ENAMEX>
            (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It mapped to a predic ted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> exon gene on
            human chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, with orthologous (but incomplete)
            sequences on mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and rat chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). An orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has recently been
            reported from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and named sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> associated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1A</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SCAP1A</NUMEX>). Alignment of the human and rat
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> is shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. Although the specific
            function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is currently unknown, it
            contains a potential V-type ATPase domain as well as
            several predicted coiled-coil regions (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          
          
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15037</NUMEX>
            This clone encodes an ORF of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that was
            detected specifically in hamster testis (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It
            mapped to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 19 and 1</TIMEX>
            in human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, respectively. A comparison of
            the predicted human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> based on several partial
            human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNAs</ENAMEX> and a mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oocyte</ENAMEX>-testis
            gene 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Otg1</NUMEX>) is shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. The protein
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is predicted to contain several coiled coil
            regions but no other potential functional domains
            (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).

            and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 in human</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, respectively and we
            have assembled the orthologous sequences from human,

        Discussion
        
          KIF27: a new kinesin family member
          Our studies revealed the existence of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
          the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-based molecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motors</ENAMEX>, which we have named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIF27</TIMEX>. KIF27 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was detected
          primarily in hamster testis but weaker signals were also
          present in several other tissues, suggesting that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may function in numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types. Significant
          characteristics of the KIF27 genes mapped in human, mouse
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> included a conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> exon arrangement and the
          existence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> mRNAs that resulted from
          alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX>, at least in human. Although partial
          cDNAs existed for the human and macaque <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in public
          databases, we were able to construct full length cDNA
          sequences for human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> from genomic
          comparisons, and to assemble a corresponding sequence
          from macaque by joining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previously reported cDNAs.
          Kinesins are characterized by a conserved motor domain of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">350</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that may be located at the
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> (KIN-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">carboxy-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIN-C</ENAMEX>) or
          within the polypeptide (KIN-I) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and the motor
          domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIF27</ENAMEX> is located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Based on this arrangement and the sequence of
          the adjacent neck domain, we assigned KIF27 to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phyogenetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinesins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-5</ENAMEX> subgroup
          is defined by the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIF4 protein</ENAMEX>, which is primarily
          localized to the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">matrix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with
          chromosomes during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mitosis</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . In cell division,
          nuclear kinesins of this chromokinesin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> appear to be
          important for the maintenance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids on the
          metaphase plate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . However, additional functions
          for nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kinesins</ENAMEX> have recently been uncovered. For
          example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIF17a</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-4</ENAMEX> subgroup that is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predominantly</ENAMEX> expressed in germ cells, was recently shown
          to possess transcriptional regulatory properties by
          controlling access of the transcriptional activator
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein CREM</ENAMEX> to a coactivator, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT [ 37</ENAMEX> ] . Clearly,
          functional analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">KIF27</NUMEX> polypeptide will be
          needed to determine the subcellular location of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to determine whether it may add to the growing
          number of kinesins that function in the nucleus. In this
          regard, although the carboxy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> regions of KIF27
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">KIF4</NUMEX> display little significant sequence similarity,
          both contain a putative topoisomerase domain that may be
          important for nuclear functions (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In addition,
          several clusters of basic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that may function
          as nuclear localization signals are located in the KIF27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          SMYD2: a putative chromatin remodeling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein</ENAMEX>
          The final clone isolated in our search encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">433</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX> whose sequence was highly conserved
          from human to pufferfish. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, now named <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SMYD2</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">contains SET</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYND</ENAMEX> domains that are characteristic of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with chromatin remodeling capabilities. The SET
          domain is a common feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with histone
          lysine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl transferase</ENAMEX> (HKMT) activity and has been
          identified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> ranging
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and viruses to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The SMYD2
          SET domain is separated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts (i.e. a S<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-ET</TIMEX>
          domain) and is followed by a short cyteine-rich region
          that is common in many SET domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (figures 2and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). The MYND domain is located between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX> of
          the SET domain and similar domains have been identified
          in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that function as transcriptional
          repressors, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is fused to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AML-1</ENAMEX> transcription factor in the t(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX> in acute myeloid leukemias [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MYND</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> zinc finger motifs and is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction interface</ENAMEX> responsible for the
          recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corepressors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] .
          This domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is conserved in several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in public databases, including the recently
          described SMYD1 (aka BOP) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SMYD1</ENAMEX> have been reported thus far
          (referred to by their original names, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BOP1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m-BOP2</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-BOP</ENAMEX>) that are products of a single gene that result
          from either alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> usage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m-BOP</ENAMEX> is essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> differentiation
          and morphogenesis while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-BOP</ENAMEX> is expressed in cytotoxic T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphoctes</ENAMEX>. Studies are currently underway to examine the
          function(s) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SMYD2</ENAMEX> in testis and heart.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomic</ENAMEX> studies in the hamster
          The impetus for this study arose from the need to
          perform <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments to investigate the
          molecular changes elicited by environmental toxicants on
          male reproduction function in hamster. Comparisons
          performed between the limited numbers of hamster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in public databases with ortho logous sequences
          from the mouse suggested that, despite the close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxonomic</ENAMEX> relationship between hamster and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>,
          evolutionary divergence in coding sequences was
          sufficiently great in certain cases that reagents
          developed for the mouse would be of limited use for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> studies in the hamster. This conclusion was
          supported by experimental observations in our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> indicating that probes derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> cDNAs yield inconsistent results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern</ENAMEX>
          blotting under stringent hybridization conditions (data
          not shown). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reagents</ENAMEX> described here will now permit
          the initiation of genomic studies in the hamster.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, cDNA and plasmid preparation
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from testes of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> hamsters ( 
          Mesocricetus auratus ). Poly A +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          was isolated using the poly A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spinâ„</ENAMEX>¢ mRNA isolation kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyA +RNA</ENAMEX>
          was converted to double stranded cDNA using the cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Synthesis Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). The
          cDNA was then digested to completion with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DpnII</ENAMEX> and electrophoresed on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>
          agarose gel. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of digested cDNAs in size
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ranges</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 100 and 800 bp</TIMEX> were excised from the gel

          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of cDNA was ligated into a pBluescript
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> that had been digested with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BamHI</ENAMEX> and alkaline phosphatased to
          decrease the rate of self-ligation. The ligations were
          transformed into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DH5Î±</NUMEX> supercompetent cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>) and positive clones were identified by
          blue-white selection. The success of the cloning
          procedure was initially monitored by picking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> clones
          from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, preparing plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and sequencing.
          These preliminary studies indicated that the most useful
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> sets were those derived from cDNAs in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-300
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> range. White <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets were
          carefully picked and used to inoculate single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of a

          using the full lysate protocol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montageâ„</ENAMEX>¢ Plasmid
          Miniprep96 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bedford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>). Typical yields

          Sequencing
          Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> of
          the diluted sample was sequenced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well format using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman Coulter</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>). The reactions were cleaned up by an ethanol
          precipitation step in which <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml glycogen,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼l</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> was added and the plate was
          centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were
          washed twice with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, air dried and
          dissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼l</NUMEX> of molecular biology grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formamide</ENAMEX>.
          A drop of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral oil</ENAMEX> was overlaid on each reaction and
          these were then run on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CEQ2000</NUMEX> capillary array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman Coulter, Inc.</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Sequence analysis
          Raw sequence data was first imported into the Contig
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Express</ENAMEX> component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector NTI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of sequence
          analysis programs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InforMax, Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). Each
          clone was named according to its position in the original
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate, for example, clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1030</TIMEX> came from position
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> in plate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector</ENAMEX> sequences were first scanned in
          batch mode for the presence of vector-derived sequences
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contig Express</ENAMEX> and these sequences were trimmed
          before proceeding. In some cases, manual processing of
          the sequences was necessary using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VecScreen</ENAMEX> program
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Canter for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/VecScreen/VecScreen.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. The
          presence of 
          DpnII <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at either end of the
          clone simplified the removal of vector sequences. The
          sequences were concatenated in batches of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96</NUMEX> into a text
          file using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTA</ENAMEX> format and submitted for a batch BLASTN
          search using the interface program <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BLASTCL3</TIMEX>. This search
          returned the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> top matches into an output file. No
          further analysis was performed in those cases where a
          match with a known gene was clearly established, and the
          clone was annotated as the hamster orthologue of a known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. A series of additional comparisons were performed
          if a clear relationship between a hamster clone and known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was not established by this initial search. The
          most useful additional comparison was a BLASTX search,
          which compares the translated sequence of the input clone
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> frames to the peptide sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>.
          This search clarified the identity of several additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hamster</ENAMEX> clones. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> clones did not match to known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> and were analyzed to determine whether they
          might represent potentially novel genes. First, the
          output sequences were translated in all frames to
          determine whether a complete open reading frame (ORF) was
          present. If so, the clones were resequenced on both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strands</ENAMEX> to ensure that the sequence was correct.
          Promising sequences were compared to the public version
          of the annotated human sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v 9.30a.1</ENAMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensembl</ENAMEX>

          genome sequence in the same database. When matching
          genomic loci were identified, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 100,000 bp</NUMEX> of
          genome sequence surrounding the match was imported into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector NTI</ENAMEX> and submitted to gene prediction software
          programs to determine if the hamster sequences were
          located within exons of predicted genes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> gene
          prediction programs were used FGENESH

          Predicted cDNA sequences were then assembled into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> files and subjected to further comparisons
          against cDNA and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> databases at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>. Genome structures
          were further examined using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PipMaker</ENAMEX>, a program that
          supports comparisons of large DNA fragments and
          identifies short conserved regions of similarity, such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX>. The predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences of the derived
          cDNAs were analyzed for the presence of functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> using the conserved domain function of BLAST at

          was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV</ENAMEX> light
          and hybridized with specific probes labeled with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32P</NUMEX>-dCTP
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin Elmer Life Sciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) using the
