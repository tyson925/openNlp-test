        The mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) family
        consists of three commonly recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>: the
        extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the
        c-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">jun</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as the stress
        activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (SAPK) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p38</NUMEX> kinase. While
        many actions have been associated with activation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> particular functions of interest to our
        laboratory are mitogen-stimulated growth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and smooth
        muscle cell contraction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathways,
        activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway and the intracellular
        signaling pathways associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation are the
        best delineated. Known activators include reactive oxygen
        species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , growth factors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and agonists of
        G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other MAPK
        pathways, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>, have been implicated in
        a variety of similar cellular functions. Known activators
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> in vascular smooth muscle cells
        include reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] , mechanical strain
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , hypoxia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and a variety of cytokines and
        growth factors. The mechanisms of many cellular functions
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> are not yet clearly defined.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway is involved in apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , arginine
        vasopressin-induced increases in smooth muscle Î±-actin in
        vascular smooth muscle cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] as well as in
        phosphorylation of transcription factors c-jun, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-2</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELK-1</ENAMEX> and phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na-K-2CI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cotransporter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p38</NUMEX> pathway has been implicated in apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ,
        neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] as well
        as angiotensin ll-induced contraction in vascular smooth
        muscle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Recently, it has been noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and p38
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> can be activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled</ENAMEX> receptor
        agonists, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">angiotensin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, in vascular smooth muscle
        cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . In cardiac myocytes, both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p38</TIMEX> and JNK
        pathways have been activated by endothelin-1 (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and the
        Î± 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic</ENAMEX> receptor agonist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylephrine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and p38
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> to be activated by the same agonists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein
        coupled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> which activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> led to the
        investigation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT as a possible activator of the JNK
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, acting 
        via the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2A receptor</ENAMEX>, is a known activator of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 22</ENAMEX> ] . In
        these studies we tested the hypothesis that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> would
        activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat aortic</ENAMEX> vascular
        smooth muscle cells.
      
      
        Results
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway
          In agreement with previously published studies from
          our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT caused a concentration-dependent activation
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This activation occurs
          maximally at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> of stimulation and returns to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> levels by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This time course
          of activation is consistent with that of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein
          coupled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p38</NUMEX> pathway
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p38</NUMEX> pathway has demonstrated a different time
          course of activation 
          via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX>
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Using the time point (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>) at which angiotensin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> demonstrates maximal
          stimulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway we performed a
          concentration response curve (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -9-</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -5M</TIMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT in
          vascular smooth muscle cells. Western analysis using
          phosphospecific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> was used to measure activation
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p38</NUMEX> pathway. A total or non-phosphospecific antibody
          was used to ensure equal loading of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p38 protein</ENAMEX>. After
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">thirty-minutes</TIMEX> of incubation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -9-</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -5M</TIMEX>),
          there was no enhanced phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          bottom). In contrast, incubation with anisomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX>) induced significant phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
          above basal). These data suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT does not
          activate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p38</TIMEX> pathway in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> vascular smooth muscle
          cells despite the ability of other agonists to activate
          the pathway in these cells.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3shows</TIMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of incubation with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -9-</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -5M</TIMEX>) resulted in a trend towards a modest
          increase in phosphorylation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p46</NUMEX> JNK isoform. This
          trend, however, was not statistically significant. In
          contrast, anisomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) induced significant
          phosphorylation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p46</NUMEX> JNK isoform (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-7</ENAMEX> fold above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX>). Both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p54 and p46</TIMEX> bands were analyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densitometry</ENAMEX> (data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p54</TIMEX> not shown). However,
          incubation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT did not produce statistically
          significant activation in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> when compared to
          vehicle. These data suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT does not
          substantially activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway in vascular smooth
          muscle cells. However, the data obtained with anisomycin
          provides evidence that this pathway can be activated in
          these cells.
          To confirm that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> was an optimal time
          point for observing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX>,
          we next performed a time course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation
          after exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> vascular smooth muscle
          cells. At no time point (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 min, 15 min, 30 min</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>) did <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-HT</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -5M) enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> levels (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These data fail to support a
          role for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway in
          vascular smooth muscle cells.
          To demonstrate that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled</ENAMEX> receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> could activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway in our vascular
          smooth muscle cells, we incubated the cells with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">angiotensin II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -9-</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -5M</TIMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Angiotensin II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -8-</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -5M</TIMEX>) produced a significant
          increase in the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> speculate that the differences in the level
          of phosphorylation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p46</NUMEX> JNK isoform in the vehicle
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> maybe due to differences in the JNK
          expression over time in cultured cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> used in
          these experiments were of a later passage than those used
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT incubation studies. These data, in addition
          to that obtained with anisomycin, demonstrate that in
          these vascular smooth muscle cells the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway can be
          activated.
          Due to the trend toward increased phosphorylation of
          both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p46 and p54</TIMEX> JNK isoforms by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, we next
          performed JNK activity assays to determine whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT
          had any significant effect on kinase activity. This assay
          was chosen to ensure that the western analyses used were
          sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in the
          activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway. There was no significant
          difference in the levels of activity at any concentration
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -9-</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -5M</TIMEX>) after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> in vascular smooth muscle cells (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In
          contrast, anisomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 ng/ml, 30 min</ENAMEX>) produced a
          significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> activation (approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold above basal). These data, in combination with the
          above findings, do not support a role for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT in the
          activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathway in vascular smooth muscle
          cells.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> is an activator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway in vascular
        smooth muscle cells. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> appears to be unable
        to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> in vascular smooth
        muscle cells. No observable changes in activation, as
        measured by phosphorylation status, were seen at any of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT concentrations (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -9-</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -5M</TIMEX>) or time points (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 min,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min, 60 min and 2 hr</TIMEX>) examined. The data from the kinase
        activity assay also demonstrated no activation of the JNK
        pathway by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT.
        The mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with many cellular functions. The ability of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-HT</TIMEX> to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway is consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX>'s
        role as a mitogenic stimulus and vasoconstrictor. Several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasoactive G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled agonists</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiotensin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and endothelin, have also been shown to
        activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 21</NUMEX> ] . These same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> also activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and p38
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. These agonists have different time course and
        concentration profiles for activation of the different MAPK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation by angiotensin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT occurs
        at relatively lower agonist concentrations and within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of stimulation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19,23</NUMEX>). The activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p38</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathways by angiotensin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and endothelin occurs at
        higher concentrations of agonist and requires a longer
        incubation with the stimulus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 25</NUMEX> ] . There are data
        which also suggest that different signal transduction
        pathways are utilized for the different pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX>
        ] . This differential activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathways is most
        likely due to the role that each plays in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The ERK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> is associated with growth where as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p38</TIMEX> and JNK
        pathways are "stress response" pathways.
        In light of data for the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor agonists</ENAMEX>, the inability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, also <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein
        coupled receptor, was initially surprising. While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> has
        never been shown to increase activation of either the p38
        or JNK pathways, it has been linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2A receptor</ENAMEX> is the primary serotonergic
        receptor which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> to activation the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway in
        vascular smooth muscle cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX>'s inability to
        activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> pathways may be due to a lack of
        coupling of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2A receptor signaling pathway</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>.
        It has recently been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-protein coupled
        receptors with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDZ</ENAMEX> domains, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SH2-containing</TIMEX> domains and PTB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G-proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Grb2 and JAK2</TIMEX>,
        which may allow these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to bypass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-proteins
        and utilize other signaling cascades (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29</NUMEX>). This ability of
        G-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX> to modulate the signal cascade
        used, independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-proteins, suggests a broader range
        of interaction with signaling components. This may provide
        one explanation for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and its
        lack of effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>.
        Another possible explanation for the differential
        activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathways by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT may relate to the
        varied roles <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT in different cell types and the multiple
        receptors which mediate these roles. When examining the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> role of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT in other cell types, in regards
        to apoptosis and cellular responses to stress, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> is
        generally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . In particular, in
        neuronal cells the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1A receptor</ENAMEX> is upregulated under
        conditions of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX>
        ] . The anti-apoptotic effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT maybe due to
        scavenging of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen</ENAMEX> species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] as well as
        stimulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> pathway which results in inhibition
        of a caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-like enzyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . There are no currently
        published studies examining the role of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT as an
        anti-apoptotic factor in vascular smooth muscle cells. It
        may be that under stressful conditions, such as a disease
        state or a loss of nutrients which occurs in a state of
        ischemia, the smooth muscle cells upregulate a new
        complement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . These new
        receptors maybe involved in activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p38</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> pathways, but the studies presented here do not
        directly address this issue. They do, however, support the
        conclusion that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2A receptor</ENAMEX> does not activate the p38
        orJNK pathways in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> vascular smooth muscle cells.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Aortic smooth muscle cell culture
          Vascular smooth muscle cells were derived from the
          aorta of male Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> by an explant method
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The smooth muscle cells
          were plated on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P-100</ENAMEX>'s and grown to confluence. The
          cells were used between passages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 9</NUMEX>. The cells were
          positively stained for smooth muscle <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±-actin</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oncogene</ENAMEX>
