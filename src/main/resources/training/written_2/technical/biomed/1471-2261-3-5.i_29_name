        Since the initial report by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connolly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valvulopathy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> taking the combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fenfluramine</ENAMEX> and phentermine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fen-phen</NUMEX>), controversy has
        surrounded the issue of associated risk. Initial reports of
        remarkably high prevalence of aortic and mitral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regurgitation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>) as assessed by echocardiography
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] were subsequently
        supported by most [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] but not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        . These uncontrolled reports were soon followed by a series
        of studies in which prevalence of
        echocardiographically-defined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and MR were assessed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who had taken fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine,
        phentermine, or combinations of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> and
        compared to unexposed, matched control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . The most recent of these studies
        found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> currently taking fenfluramine or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexfenfluramine</ENAMEX> had mild or greater AR or moderate or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">greater MR</ENAMEX>, similar to the very high prevalence reported in
        older studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The only prospective study found a
        significant, exposure-related increase in the risk of
        clinically diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">valve disease</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fenfluramine</ENAMEX> and dexfenfluramine, but not phentermine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Some recent reviews conclude that the risks associated
        with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are similar, real but
        modest for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aortic valve disease</ENAMEX>, and barely detectable for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mitral valve disease</ENAMEX>; phentermine appears not to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased risk [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Nevertheless, interpretation of the results of these
        studies has been so varied that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have even
        questioned any causal relationship for fenfluramine
        exposure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . However, analyses to date have not
        formally considered major biases that would act to deflate
        the actual risk associated with fenfluramine use. Most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have calculated only prevalence ratios or
        prevalence odds ratios, dividing the prevalence or odds of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">valve disease</ENAMEX> in exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> by prevalence or odds in
        an unexposed control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. This approach contrasts with a
        prospective design wherein relative risk is calculated
        using only newly arising (incident) cases and with
        conventional case-control studies in which an estimate of
        relative risk (the odds ratio) can be made. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
        prior valve <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> are included in both the exposed and
        the unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, a gross underestimate of actual risk
        may occur. The dilution in estimated risk is likely to be
        particularly important if the background prevalence among
        unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> is substantial but the incidence of new
        cases during the observation period is small, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. While other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have
        noted this potentially large bias [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , no attempts at
        appropriate correction have been made.
        A further source of under-estimated risk in prior
        studies is the lack of consideration given to the time
        element. In a typical prospective study, both the exposed
        and unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are generally followed for an equal
        period of time. However, no prior echocardiographic study
        examining anorexic drug-associated valve <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> has
        considered the fact that measurable differences in
        prevalence have arisen among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> exposed to these drugs
        over a remarkably short period of time (usually a few
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>) whereas the prevalent valve disease in the
        comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> likely arose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a number of years</TIMEX> or
        even a lifetime.
        In this meta-analysis, we estimated incidence rates
        based on duration of drug exposure and compared these to
        expected incidence rates in order to obtain unbiased
        estimates of relative risk for the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Search, Selection</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Extraction</ENAMEX>
          We first sought to identify all published studies with
          echocardiographic assessment of cardiac valve
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regurgitation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> exposed to fenfluramine or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexfenfluramine</ENAMEX> and in suitable controls. The search for
          studies included examination of prior meta-analyses and
          reviews, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> search (using the terms fenfluramine or
          dexfenfluramine, diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, echocardiogram or
          echocardiographic, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">valvular heart disease</ENAMEX>), and
          review of references of identified articles. For this
          analysis we included only studies that reported duration
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use. In some studies, results were reported
          separately by duration of exposure. Each duration group
          was considered as a separate observation if number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> exposed, number of cases observed, and duration
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> was reported.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Synthesis</ENAMEX>
          We first evaluated studies reporting echocardiographic
          prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive valvulopathy (mild or greater
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and moderate or greater MR) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who
          had taken either fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine (alone
          or in combination with phentermine) and in matched
          controls [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . In most of these
          studies, echocardiograms were performed after the drugs
          had been discontinued and were read without knowledge of
          prior drug exposure by multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In
          some studies, control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were derived from patients
          assigned to placebo in a formal randomized trial of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fenfluramine</ENAMEX> or dexfenfluramine. In others, controls
          matched for age, gender and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> were recruited and
          examined.
          In a true prospective study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with valvulopathy
          at baseline would be excluded from follow-up or
          calculation of incidence rates. Since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> study had
          performed echocardiography on a substantial number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> prior to initiation of the diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ,
          some means of estimating and correcting for the baseline
          prevalence in the other studies was necessary. For this
          analysis we have used the unexposed control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for
          each study to provide such an estimate. Thus, the
          prevalence rate in the control (unexposed) group of each
          study was used to estimate the number of background cases
          expected in the exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>(s). Any cases observed
          beyond this background number were considered "new" or
          incident cases. This approach is mathematically
          equivalent to modelling the rate of change in prevalence
          in the exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> providing the
          initial estimate of prevalence. The concept is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2using</ENAMEX> data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jollis, et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          ] . Duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use provided the time factor to
          estimate incidence in the exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies
          which did not report duration of drug exposure were
          therefore excluded from this meta-analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 23</NUMEX> ]
          .
          Of major importance in this analysis is the estimation
          of the expected incidence rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>
          (for estimation of relative risk). The most
          straightforward estimate of incidence would require a
          sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> having no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> or MR at baseline and who had a repeat echocardiogram
          some time in the future. While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies performed
          echocardiograms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> apart in sizable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>,
          both showed either no net progression or a net 
          decrease in regurgitation in the
          unexposed, control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . These findings
          underscore the infrequency of new onset, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive AR
          or MR in the unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
          As an alternative estimate of expected incidence we
          modelled change in prevalence in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. In the
          first, data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> study were utilized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          ] . In that study, the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive AR or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 40</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The prevalent cases
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following decade</TIMEX> (ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-49</NUMEX>) were therefore
          assumed to have arisen since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX>. For each subsequent
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>, the increase in prevalence was assumed to have
          arisen since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior decade</TIMEX>. Additional assumptions
          were that incident cases did not drop out (that is, there
          was no differential mortality and change in prevalence
          was the result of cumulative incidence), that incidence
          rates were constant within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, and that there was no
          cohort effects (i.e., that incidence rates in older
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> when they were young were similar to the
          incidence rates in currently young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>). Given
          theses assumptions, the change in prevalence is given by
          the expression
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - i) t
          were i is the incidence rate per year and t is the
          number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> between prevalence data points (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full decades</TIMEX>). The equation was solved for i given the
          observed change in prevalence between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> and time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elapsed</ENAMEX> (using the end of each time period). Incidence
          rates were calculated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>
          separately for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each decade</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. These
          estimated incidence rates are shown in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. As a
          conservative estimate for relative risk calculations, all
          the rates were pooled (as the unweighted mean of the
          calculated rates in table 2for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>),
          recognizing that this will yield a higher "unexposed"
          rate than was likely present for the younger and
          predominantly female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> exposed to the anorexic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The average estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> incidence rates
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX> and over calculated in this manner were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.357%</NUMEX>
          per year for mild or greater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.143%</NUMEX> per year for
          moderate or greater MR.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> data set used to estimate unexposed
          incidence rates was the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of the studies
          listed in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>. Cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>
          reported in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were assumed to have
          arisen between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX> and the average age of the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> in each study. A mean of the estimated incidence
          from each study was calculated and weighted by the number
          of controls per study. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX> are
          found in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under age 40</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , the
          assumption that all the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and MR occurred only
          after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX> will result in conservatively high estimates
          of incidence (resulting in lower estimates of relative
          risk).
          The observed number of "incident" cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> or MR in
          the exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was calculated as the total number of
          cases minus the number expected at baseline (estimated
          from the prevalence in the unexposed control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in
          each study). Any negative numbers were set to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (one
          instance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> with under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> exposure). The
          expected number of cases in the exposed population (for
          Poisson analyses) was calculated as the incidence rate
          (per year) determined from the pooled rate in controls
          (obtained as described above) multiplied by the duration
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>). The probability of observing the
          number of "incident" cases in the exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of each
          individual study given the number expected from the
          pooled estimate was calculated using a Poisson
          distribution. Confidence intervals for the percent of
          incident cases during each study (figures 3and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) were
          calculated as suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fleiss</ENAMEX> for observed versus
          expected proportions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Effect of exposure duration
          and other factors on percent of incident cases during
          each study was tested in a weighted analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariance</ENAMEX> using the GLM procedure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>).
          Relative risks were calculated as (incident cases /
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person-years</ENAMEX> in exposed) / (cases in controls /
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person-years</ENAMEX> in controls). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Person-years</ENAMEX> in the exposed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were calculated as: (total number exposed - cases
          expected at baseline) × (mean duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use
          reported for each study). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Person-years</ENAMEX> in unexposed
          controls were calculated as: (total number in the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>) × (the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years from age 40</TIMEX> to the average
          age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>). Note that pooled incidence rates for
          the unexposed were not used in this analysis (so as not
          to inflate power); rather, each study provided its own
          estimates. Significance and confidence intervals for the
          relative risks were calculated as suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleinbaum</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] for a density type follow-up study. This
          approach tests the difference in incidence between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> given that follow-up time may be different in the
          exposed and unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        Raw data from each study is given for mild or greater AR
        in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3and</TIMEX> for moderate or greater MR in table 4.
        Estimates of unexposed incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and MR utilizing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in these studies yielded
        values <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> higher than estimates from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> study; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.555%</NUMEX> per year for mild or greater AR
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.219%</NUMEX> per year for moderate or greater MR. To provide
        conservative estimates of relative risk, these rates were
        used to calculate the expected number affected (given the
        duration of exposure in each study) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> analyses in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">tables 5and 6</ENAMEX>. Estimates of "incident" cases and relative
        risks based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years are also given in tables 5and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
        The percent of incident cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> during each study
        (calculated without dividing by duration of exposure for
        this analysis) was found to be clearly related to duration
        of exposure. This is illustrated in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In a weighted
        analysis of covariance including all the studies in table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX>, suggesting that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the variance between
        the studies of the percent of incident cases was explained
        by duration of exposure. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> relating estimated
        incidence to duration (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.00720</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0001</NUMEX>). In contrast, time since stopping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and dose
        were not related to estimated incidence in this analysis.
        All but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        point estimates included the regression line, suggesting a
        fairly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homogeneous</ENAMEX> estimate of risk. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, the
        predicted cumulative incidence after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX> exposure was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.6%</NUMEX>. The weighted estimate of incidence from all studies
        combined (ignoring duration of exposure) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.29%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.51% - 7.16%</NUMEX>, z = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.2</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00001</NUMEX>) during a mean
        exposure time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8.78 months</TIMEX>. This contrasts with an
        expected incidence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.42%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 months</TIMEX> at the rate
        estimated from the pooled control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of these studies.
        The summary relative risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.6</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.3</NUMEX> -
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.5</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00001</NUMEX>).
        The percent of incidence cases of moderate or greater MR
        was lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> in these studies. There was no
        significant correlation with duration of exposure (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.126</NUMEX>, regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00037</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.39</NUMEX>) or with
        dose or time since stopping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (by weighted analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariance</ENAMEX> using continuous variables). The percent of
        incidence cases was marginally greater in those exposed for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> or more (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.30%</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX>, mean ± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>) compared to
        those with lower exposure times (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.54%</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.09</NUMEX>).
        Overall, estimated incidence was markedly greater than
        expected in most studies as shown in figure 4and table 6.
        The weighted estimate of incidence of MR including all
        studies was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.09%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.78% - 1.50%</NUMEX>, z = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.00001</NUMEX>) during an average exposure time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8.89 months</TIMEX>
        with an expected incidence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.16%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 months</TIMEX> based on
        the pooled control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The summary relative risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>
        was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.9</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.6</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00001</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        Prior summary estimates of risk for developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and MR have been based on simple
        comparisons of prevalence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> exposed and unexposed
        to anorexic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. For example, without making any
        adjustments to observed prevalence rates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loke, et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        ] reported a summary "relative risk" of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.82</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.20</NUMEX> -
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.61</NUMEX>, z = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.21</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.55</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.06</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.25</NUMEX>, z = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.28</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>) for MR utilizing
        most of the same studies included in the present report.
        Our findings suggest that these estimates are strongly
        biased toward the null because of counting background,
        prevalent cases as incident cases in both exposed and
        unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (a form of nondifferential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misclassification</ENAMEX>) and not considering the remarkably short
        period of exposure during which most observed differences
        in prevalence arose. In contrast, we found much higher
        relative risks using methods to correct for these biases;
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.6</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX> (both p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00001</NUMEX>).
        Furthermore, our estimates of percent incident cases of AR
        among exposed were highly correlated with duration of
        exposure and appeared homogeneous, suggesting a
        biologically relevant, strong, causal relationship.
        Are these high estimates of risk unprecedented? In the
        only true prospective study comparing risk in exposed and
        unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jick, et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] identified clinically
        diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">valvular disease</ENAMEX> using the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK General</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Practice Research Database</ENAMEX>. Using the data provided in the
        paper, a valve-specific analysis may be performed comparing
        incidence of aortic and mitral disease in those exposed for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX> or longer versus all others. The results reveal a
        relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17.1</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.3</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>, both with p
        < <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.0001 by chi-square</NUMEX>. Since the few cases that arose
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> of exposure are included in the "unexposed"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> in this analysis, even these high risks represent an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimate</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the close similarity in the
        estimate of AR relative risk to the present study is
        remarkable. The much higher risk for MR compared to our
        estimate may represent fundamental biological differences
        between clinically apparent valve <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">echocardiographically</ENAMEX> assessed valve disease.
        A single study among those reviewed in our meta-analysis
        excluded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">valve disease</ENAMEX> using echocardiograms
        taken prior to starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . That study yielded
        estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and MR incidence that were similar to our
        summary estimates, further supporting our findings. The
        fact that so many studies have observed statistically
        significant differences in prevalence after relatively
        short exposure to drug suggest that underlying incidence
        rates of new valvulopathy must be extraordinarily high
        compared to the expected low unexposed rate.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> provided in this study can be used to estimate the
        relative contribution of exposure to fenfluramines to
        overall incidence of echocardiographically defined,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and MR. Given that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 2.5%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had used anorexic
        prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (mostly fenfluramine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexfenfluramine</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1996 and 1998</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 32% and 11%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>
        respectively could be attributed to fenfluramine or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexfenfluramine</ENAMEX> use. Among those who had actually taken the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, the attributable fraction rises to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95% and 83%</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and MR respectively.
        Why was there no apparent effect of exposure duration on
        MR incidence? This may well be due to low power. If only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> of an incident case had been seen in the exposed group
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hensrud, et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> extra case had been seen in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> exposed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 months</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jollis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] then a
        significant logarithmic relationship between duration and
        percent incident cases would have become apparent,
        illustrating the precarious nature of correlations when
        events are few. While we cannot claim such a relationship
        does exist, the relatively low incidence seen generally for
        moderate or greater MR makes establishing strong
        correlations difficult. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, we cannot conclude
        that a positive association between exposure duration and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incident MR</ENAMEX> does 
        not exist, only that the current
        studies are inconclusive regarding this relationship. We
        can conclude, however that the current studies provide
        sufficient power in aggregate to clearly demonstrate an
        overall excess risk for developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MR.</ENAMEX>
        Another approach to expressing excess risk is the
        calculation of "number needed to harm" (NNH). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> may be
        calculated as the inverse of the difference between risk in
        exposed and risk in unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. For example, the
        cumulative prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">95.6</NUMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> in those
        exposed to fenfluramines without regard to exposure time
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">342</NUMEX> cases among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3576</TIMEX> exposed, from table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) compared to
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34.7</NUMEX> per thousand among unexposed (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> cases among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2222</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unexposed</ENAMEX>) for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.4</NUMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>, the cumulative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29.9</NUMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> in exposed (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3582</TIMEX>
        exposed, from table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.8</NUMEX> per thousand (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2225</TIMEX>
        exposed) for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX>. A risk difference, as used to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculate NNH</ENAMEX>, is less subject to nondifferential
        misclassification than is a risk ratio. However,
        demonstrating association with graded exposures and
        statistical methods to determine significance or confidence
        intervals are well defined for relative risk but not for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX>. We have therefore emphasized estimates of relative
        risk. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> as calculated by
        differences between exposed and unexposed prevalence rates,
        shown above, were very similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> determined using
        differences between our estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-month</TIMEX> incidence rates
        in exposed and unexposed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NNH</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>
        by this approach), further illustrating the internal
        consistency of our analysis.
        Our study has several limitations. There is no direct
        measure of true incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> or MR in the unexposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The only studies to perform repeated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">echocardiograms</ENAMEX> (separated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> in both) in large
        numbers of unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> found either no net
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> or net regression in their control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . Because these studies did not report usable direct
        measures of incidence, we made several assumptions to
        estimate unexposed incidence using raw data from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> study and from the studies reviewed here. Our
        observation that incidence rates estimated from both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were of a similar magnitude supports the
        feasibility of this approach. Further, our estimate is
        conservative. For example, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> estimates
        would have yielded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> higher relative risks. Had we
        subtracted the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive AR (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX>) seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CARDIA</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and considered the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course of new <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">valve disease</ENAMEX> development to commence at
        age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> (the ending age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CARDIA</ENAMEX> study), the unexposed
        incidence would have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> the rate we
        used and the relative risks doubled.
        Our estimate of apparent incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MR</ENAMEX> among
        the exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is also based on several assumptions.
        However, the strong, consistent relationship between the
        percent of incident cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> in each study and duration
        of exposure suggests that our estimates were reasonable and
        biologically relevant. We acknowledge that there were a
        number of differences between the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> included in
        our analysis. There were differences in study design and
        methods (though most were quite similar), fenfluramine or
        dexfenfluramine doses (though in most studies, doses were
        similar), additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> used, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> characteristics,
        interval between cessation of therapy and echocardiography,
        and completeness of follow-up. However, these differences
        would likely add random error and therefore 
        decrease any observed correlation.
        Estimates of incidence among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unexposed</ENAMEX> controls from each
        study were more variable, resulting in greater differences
        between studies in estimates of relative risk. This is not
        surprising considering the relatively rare occurrence of
        new onset <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> or MR in unexposed middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        We have not formally considered other potential sources
        of bias in our analyses. These include measurement bias
        (related to acquisition and reading of echocardiograms) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] , selection bias (particularly in studies with
        incomplete follow-up) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , and potential reversibility
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valvulopathy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 24 25 32</NUMEX> ] . If a reversible component
        occurred rather quickly after stopping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, then one
        might expect a stable, lower prevalence in studies
        performed well after <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were stopped, with no
        relationship between prevalence of valve dysfunction and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the most recently published
        study (which did not suffer from measurement bias) showed a
        high prevalence (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> taking fenfluramine
        or dexfenfluramine at the time of the echocardiogram,
        similar to the older prevalence studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Regarding
        the potential reversibility of valve dysfunction, great
        caution must be exercised in assuming any substantial
        reversal of valvular plaques, as recent pathological
        studies suggest a progressive nature to these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        ] . Furthermore, limited, early apparent echocardiographic
        improvement of acute rheumatic carditis has also been
        recently demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The early improvement seen
        in this setting certainly does not preclude later
        progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatic valvular heart disease</ENAMEX>.
        In conclusion, we have estimated risks associated with
        use of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX> after correcting for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of bias. Accordingly, our estimates of relative
        risk associated with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine use,
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.6</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>, are higher than in prior
        reviews. These findings lend strong support to the view
        that fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are potent causal
        factors in the development of both aortic and mitral
        valvular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>.
