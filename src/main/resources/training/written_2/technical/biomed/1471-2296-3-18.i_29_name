        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> is rapidly becoming one of the most important
        medical and public health problems of our time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a high rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and early
        mortality if left untreated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Studies indicate
        that the presence of obesity increases the risk for
        developing cardiovascular diseases and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ]
        . Its role as a health hazard in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> has been well
        recognized for some time [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ]
        but little attention has been paid to childhood and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adolescent obesity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        The prevalence of obesity among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22-30%</NUMEX> and has increased at an
        accelerating rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] ;
        the prevalence of obesity is > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> in some pediatric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obesity</ENAMEX> in childhood is associated
        with obesity in adulthood [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] , and is a
        predictor of all causes of obesity-associated mortality
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adulthood</TIMEX>, particularly mortality from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX>, which are independent of adult
        weight [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Epidemiologic evidence supports the
        theory that the relation between obesity and disease risk
        begins early in life. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> who died in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accidents</ENAMEX> had fatty streaks in the coronary arteries and
        aorta that were found at, autopsy, and were associated with
        blood lipid profile, blood pressure, and obesity status
        obtained at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">antemortem</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        Moreover, a recent longitudinal study indicated that the
        occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and dyslipidemia in
        young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 19-32</TIMEX> y) was associated with these same
        risk factors in childhood. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Medical Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> have shown that the
        incidence of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> increased
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 to 1994</TIMEX>, and virtually all diagnosed
        cases of type 2 diabetes occurred in obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        ] . These observations are likely to reflect national
        trends and certainly deserve both confirmation, and a
        sharper focus.
        To test the hypothesis that being an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> or obese
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adolescent</ENAMEX> is associated with early appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        and lipid profile abnormalities, we performed a
        case-control study quantifying the odds ratio of overweight
        and obesity on these abnormalities through different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanner</ENAMEX>'s stages. The association between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX> and the distribution of adipose tissue was also
        tested in this study. The objective of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study was
        to determine. from a retrospective-prospective longitudinal
        study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obese male and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> having
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">abnormal glucose</ENAMEX> and/or lipid profiles at which age obesity
        in adolescence can be predictive of adult obesity and its
        obesity-associated cardiovascular risk factors.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> investigation was designed as a case-control
          study and was performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGill Universities</ENAMEX>. Many of the subjects
          were also directly recruited from nursery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. This
          study was conducted to determine the relationship between
          various indicators of adiposity and risk factors for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX> normal, overweight,
          and obese male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>. The prevalence and
          odds ratio of being overweight or obese on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and
          lipid profiles was also determined. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanner</ENAMEX> stage is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with important changes in genital development
          and sexual hormone profiles, which could have an impact
          on adipose tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distribution</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and lipid
          profiles. Informed written consent was obtained from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and/or of all participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were recruited from local and national
          advertising. To be included in the study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> had to meet the following criteria: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) be of
          Caucasian ethnicity; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) be free from diagnosed endocrine
          conditions that could lead to obesity, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) not taking
          any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> affecting body weight. They were selected
          for the study on the basis of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index.
          Standing height was measured with a wall-mounted tape,
          and weight was measured with the same standard balance
          scale.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adolescents</ENAMEX> were classified according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI; â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
          thpercentile as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¥ 95</ENAMEX> thpercentile for age
          and sex as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obese</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . Recent workshops
          concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> has been validated by studies on
          total body fat [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The standards used to identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obesity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> should
          agree with the standards used to identify grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">grade 2</ENAMEX> overweight (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 and 30</TIMEX>, respectively) in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adolescents</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI <</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
          thpercentile were classified as controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were overweight (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI ></ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thpercentile and < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thpercentile</ENAMEX>) and group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> were obese (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thpercentile</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI <</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> were classified
          as controls, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 25 and 30</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¥ 30</ENAMEX> as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obese</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sexes</ENAMEX> were grouped separately.
          WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> was calculated from the ratio of waist
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX> to arm circumference and used as a measured
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> distribution analogous to waist to hip ratio, on
          the assumption that a higher ratio of waist to arm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circumference</ENAMEX> is an indicator of a more central pattern
          of adiposity. We used this measure in preference to waist
          to hip ratio, because a study which determined peripheral
          and abdominal adipose tissue content in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> using
          magnetic resonance imaging found that WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX> correlated
          positively with intra-abdominal adipose tissue (r <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Â± 0.63</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>) while waist to hip ratio did not (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other indices of central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adiposity</ENAMEX> were
          calculated from skinfolds: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>-peripheral (CPR) as
          subscapular skinfold + suprailliac skinfold) / (triceps
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skinfold</ENAMEX>+ thigh skinfold) and ratio of subscapular to
          triceps skinfold (STR). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STR</ENAMEX> is an index of relative
          distribution of central subcutaneous adiposity. The sum
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four skinfolds</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUM</ENAMEX>) was calculated from triceps,
          subscapular, suprailliac and thigh skinfolds in the total
          sample. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUM</ENAMEX> provides a single measure of subcutaneous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adiposity</ENAMEX>. Anthropometric measurements were done by the
          same experienced evaluator to reduce variability which
          was measured at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 0.5%</NUMEX>.
          Genital development was evaluated with the criteria of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanner</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , and was performed with a questionnaire
          and physical exam by an experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, in which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">stage 1</ENAMEX> is prepubertal, stage 2 is initial development of
          the genitalia, stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX> are intermediate, and stage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> is mature. Stage of sexual maturation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> was
          determined on the basis of a combination of menarcheal
          status and breast and pubic hair development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The
          stages of sexual maturation were performed with a
          questionnaire and physical exam done by an experienced
          physician as follow: premenarcheal with no secondary
          sexual development (stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Premenarcheal with some
          secondary sexual development (stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>); premenarcheal at
          the time of study but attained menarche within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX>
          (stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>); postmenarcheal with secondary sexual
          development not yet mature (stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>); and postmenarcheal
          with secondary sexual development (stage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were instructed to arrive to the clinic
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 AM</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-hour overnight</TIMEX> fast. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was measured
          and a venous blood sample was taken followed by a
          breakfast. Fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4C</TIMEX>. Serum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels and lipid profile were
          determined. They completed a questionnaire on risk
          factors for atherosclerosis including family history of
          coronopathy, smoking, high blood pressure, personal
          history of coronopathy or myocardial infarct, history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">occlusive peripheral disease</ENAMEX>.
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> risk
          factors for atherosclerosis.
          The diagnostic criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> profile were those
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Diabetes Association</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes</ENAMEX> is defined as a fasting serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> equal or
          higher than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">126 mg/dl</ENAMEX>) and impaired fasting
          glucose with values between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Subjects</ENAMEX>
          with high fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels were referred to their
          own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> for further clinical evaluation.
          Lipid profile was also performed on the fasting blood
          sample. The blood lipid variables investigated were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triglyceride</ENAMEX> (TRG), total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX>), high-density
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, low-density
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> (LDL) cholesterol concentrations and the
          ratio of total:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDLC</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . All
          biochemical measurements were performed in an accredited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> investigation was designed as a
          retrospective-prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">longitudinal</ENAMEX> study from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> and was performed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McGill Universities</ENAMEX>. This study was
          conducted to determine the age of apparition of abnormal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and lipid profiles in a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and
          obese young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasians</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> presenting abnormal glucose
          and/or lipid profiles. The study was performed from chart
          review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> charts were pre-selected by
          the archivists. To be included in the study, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
          had to meet the following criteria: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) be of Caucasian
          ethnicity; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 32-38 y</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) be free
          from diagnosed endocrine conditions that could have led
          to obesity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) not having taken any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> affecting
          body weight, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) presenting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>)
          presenting abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and/or lipid profiles; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>)
          presenting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX> risk factors for cardiovascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> as explained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, and having been seen by
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1974 to 2000</TIMEX>. Among the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
          charts, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 128</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were having
          pertinent data at the different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> age-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, permitting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">longitudinal</ENAMEX> study of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> used in this
          study. These charts were reviewed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> reviwers. A sample
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> charts were reviewed by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> to
          determine variability between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. The inter-chart
          reviewer differences was less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were presented by specific age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, which we
          think may approximate the criteria of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanner</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] for
          genital development. WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> ratio was removed from the
          anthropometric measurements because the concept of waist
          circumference, waist to hip ratio or waist circumference
          to arm circumference was unknown or not used to quantify
          central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adiposity</ENAMEX>.

          correlated data. The analyses were interpreted using P
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> as the level of significance. An unpaired
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-test was used to analyze the difference between male
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> for each variables measured at each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanner</ENAMEX>
          stages. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlations were computed to evaluate
          the relationship between specific continuous variables.
          Odds ratios were used to quantify risk in our

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> in our study did not differ from that
          expected in an average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. As
          defined in methods WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> ratio which is an indicator of
          central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adiposity</ENAMEX> was significantly higher in both (P

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> in comparison with controls, either in

          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>. The CPR value which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of
          central-peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX> was also significantly higher
          (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) in both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX>) obese
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adolescents</ENAMEX>. The same is true for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STR</ENAMEX> and SUM values.
          For all the anthropometric measurements there were no
          significant differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2indicates</ENAMEX> that the prevalence of impaired

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX> is already significant at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tanner</ENAMEX> stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> with
          percentage prevalence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.1% and 44.1%</NUMEX> for overweight
          and obese subjects respectively. The prevalence was
          significantly higher in both (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and
          (P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> in comparison with

          stages or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> of both sexes. The prevalence of
          impaired fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> did not differ significantly
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, either in male or female.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adolescents</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> exceeding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thpercentile are at

          impaired fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. Also the prevalence of lipid
          profile abnormalities was highest among those above the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> thpercentile for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adolescents</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> exceeding

          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was already present at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tanner</ENAMEX> stage 1.
          The presence of an abnormal lipid profile was observed
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanner stages III</ENAMEX> and above.

          respectively. With use of this cutoff point, the odds
          ratio of being at risk for impaired fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          varied from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.7 to 23.7</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between anthropometric measurements,

        Discussion
        
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          The rationale underlying this part of the study is
          that the stage of sexual maturation is an important
          variable in applying anthropometric measurements as
          predictors of risk for cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. On
          average, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> seems to increase with stage of genital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> in boys relative to fatness, and then, in
          contrast, decreases in the later stages of maturation
          reflecting the rapid growth of fat free mass with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puberty</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> also increases with stage of sexual
          maturation, but relative fatness is variable, especially
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> who just attaining menarche (stage III). To
          obviate this bias, we preselected our subjects according
          to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. For instance a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 85 thpercentile</NUMEX> (for
          age and sex) was classified as being overweight, and
          those with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> thpercentile as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obese</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32</NUMEX>
          ] . Recent workshops concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> is an index
          of choice for evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obesity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>, because
          it has been validated by studies of total body fat [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          . The criteria used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obesity in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> agree with those used for grade
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and grade 2 overweight (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>+,
          respectively) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Using a representative
          sample from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> Caucasian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, we demonstrate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> is also a good
          indicator for obesity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>, however the
          readily-measured WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STR</ENAMEX>, indices of central
          obesity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUM</ENAMEX>, a single measure of subcutaneous
          adiposity, are stronger predictor of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting glucose</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels and lipid profiles, than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. We also
          demonstrated that each anthropometric variable taken
          separately can significantly predict fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels and lipid profile in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> of both
          sexes with a probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>. Our results are
          in accordance with others of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 5 and 16</TIMEX>, in
          whom, indicators of fatness such as weight-for-height,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and skinfold thicknesses have been associated with
          higher total and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>,
          and higher triglyceride concentrations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43</NUMEX> ]
          .
          Our overweight and obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> had higher
          fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> than subjects
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> in the healthy range. Furtheremore, the
          prevalence of obesity was comparable between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX>. In both sexes the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and
          impaired fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> increased relative to
          chronological age in both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) and obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). Previous study in
          Aboriginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> recognized to be at high risk for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II diabetes</ENAMEX> has shown that obesity is associated
          with high fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels.
          They also demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> exceeding
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thpercentile are at increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> or
          impaired fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, odds ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          coefficient interval <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.0</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . With use of the
          cutoff point of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thpercentile we demonstrated that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanner stage III</ENAMEX> and higher, of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sexes</ENAMEX>, are at increased risk of having impaired fasting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, with odds ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.7</NUMEX> and higher.
          Our overweight and obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> had higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TC</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRG</ENAMEX> and lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> values which correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
          and other measures of fatness. In both sexes the
          prevalence of impaired lipid profile increased relative
          to chronological age in both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) and obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">l. Adolescents</ENAMEX> of
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thare at increased risk of
          impaired fasting lipid profiles, with odds ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX>
          and higher.
        
        
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          The goal of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study was to determine the
          childhood age of abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and lipid profiles from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overweight adults</ENAMEX>. By using a retrospective-prospective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">longitudinal</ENAMEX> study design we were able to track <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and lipid profiles from late childhood and
          adolescent ages to adulthood in a white Caucasian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Then we were able to correlate their
          subsequent risk of obesity and its associated impaired
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and lipid profiles There is general agreement on
          the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> with selected cutoff points as guidelines
          for desirable weight [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47 48</NUMEX> ] . This study
          provided a basis for prediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obesity
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> from their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-15 year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, suggesting
          that this simple measurement could be applied to the
          prediction of obesity in public health programs. The
          results presented here were comparable to those observed
          in a previous study showing that with use of the cutoff
          point of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> thpercentile at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 18</TIMEX> y, the odds ratios
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 35</TIMEX> y were of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">females</ENAMEX>, with corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>
          respectively. Previous data on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-18 y olds</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX>
          Heart-Beat demonstrated that the odds ratio of overweight
          in adulthood for those with childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> values at the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">95 thpercentile</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 1.5 to 5</NUMEX> times as great as
          for those with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> values at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> thpercentile for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
          The incidence of impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> profile was
          comparable between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. In both sexes the
          incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and impaired fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          increased significantly ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) relative to
          chronological age in comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. The
          sensitivity of the selected cutoff point for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> values
          at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thpercentile at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-15 years old</TIMEX> for identifying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">impaired glucose</ENAMEX> profile at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 35</TIMEX> y was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76.4% and 77.6%</NUMEX>
          for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female, respectively. Therefore, at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 13</TIMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years old</TIMEX> who were having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â‰</ENAMEX>¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thwere
          correctly predicted to have impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> profile at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 y.</TIMEX> On the other hand, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.8%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71.4%</NUMEX> of
          female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> of this age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who were having a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â‰</ENAMEX>¤ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thwere correctly predicted to have normal
          glucose profile at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> y. As stated in the introduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> in childhood is associated with obesity in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] , and is a predictor of all
          cause of obesity-associated mortality during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adulthood</TIMEX>,
          particularly mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX>,
          which is independent of adult weight [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . The
          results of the present study agreed with a previous study
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] indicating that the metabolic alterations caused
          by excess body fat are expressed early in the natural
          history of obesity. Such alterations seem clinically
          important even in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by an increase
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> profile abnormalities in obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>.
          These observations underscore the need for research
          efforts directed at the development of effective
          interventions for obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>.
          The incidence of impaired lipid profile was comparable
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. In both sexes the incidence of
          impaired lipid profile increased significantly ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) relative to
          chronological age in comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. The
          sensitivity of the selected cutoff point for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> values
          at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> thpercentile at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-15 years old</TIMEX> for identifying
          impaired lipid profile at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 35</TIMEX> y was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77.7% and 79.2%</NUMEX>
          for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female, respectively. The specificity
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80.0% and 75.0%</NUMEX>, for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female,
          respectively. If we consider that most of the subjects
          having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMI â‰¥ 85</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">thwere</ENAMEX> also presenting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> risk
          factors for cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, this means that they
          are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Few studies have examined the long-term effects
          of adolescent obesity on adult disease. Nonetheless,
          obesity present in childhood or adolescence seems to
          increase the likelihood of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . In the present study we demonstrated that in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> obese during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adolescence</TIMEX>, risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> were increased.
          These effects seems related both to the persistence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> and to the effects of childhood or adolescent
          obesity on the quantity and location of body fat
          distribution. The risk factors for adult disease that are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with obesity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>
          persist into adulthood or increase in prevalence if
          weight gain occurs. Although both total body fat and
          regional fat deposition could account for the association
          of childhood or adolescent obesity with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adult disease</ENAMEX>, no
          studies to date have examined cardiovascular risk factors
          and related them to visceral fat.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        The strengths of the study include the use of large
        samples of both genders, a wide age range, subjects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> being studied, precise
        measurements of body composition and the use of
        well-accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> classifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>. By using a retrospective-prospective design in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of the study we were able to obtain the
        longitudinal data required to answer the questions
        addressed. In conclusion our study confirms the hypothesis
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> have higher fasting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels, and an abnormal lipid
        profile relative to their lean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. This study highlights
        the critical importance of early identification and
        intervention of adolescent obesity to avert the long-term
        consequences of it and to protect adolescent against the
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX>. There is an urgent need to
        follow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> at-risks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> to
        investigate cofactors acting in concert with obesity that
        are responsible for the early onset of risk factors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX>, a phenomenon increasingly being
        observed in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
