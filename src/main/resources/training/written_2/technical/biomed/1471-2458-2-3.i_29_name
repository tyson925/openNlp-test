        Health information systems (HIS) provide a scientific
        and technological framework to gather, manage, and
        interpret data to inform the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, policymakers,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX>, and health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> about the
        distribution and determinants of health conditions.
        Further, they can (and should) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> and measure the impact
        of interventions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Public health surveillance - a
        subset of HIS - has been defined as 
        the ongoing, systematic collection,
        analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data for
        use in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of
        public health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Public health
        surveillance can be used to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) assess the overall health
        status of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) describe the natural history of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) monitor disease trends, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) detect epidemics, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
        evaluate the effect of prevention and control measures, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
        generate hypotheses, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) facilitate epidemiologic and
        laboratory research [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> centrally planned the
        infectious diseases surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> (IDSS) of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">republics</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> were covered
        under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX>. Central monetary and technical support for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX> ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX> have
        struggled to maintain their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX>. The former
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> (FSU)-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX> outbreak in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1990s</NUMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] and the re-emergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tadjikistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>
        indicated that financial constraints resulting in the
        disruption of public health infrastructure and services had
        increased the risk of the re-emergence of infectious
        diseases [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, this transition to nationalism,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">privatization</ENAMEX>, and social reorganization posed new
        challenges to each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>. The loss of
        centralized training, public health expertise, and
        resources especially impacted the surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> in
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] Further, privatization of the FSU
        medical systems resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under</NUMEX>-budgeted public health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> and inadequately paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Combined
        with these infrastructure problems, the increased
        population migration - both within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX> and
        internationally - contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality
        through population dislocation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This has increased
        the risk of exposure to re-emerging microbial and
        environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogens</ENAMEX> and limited access to health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> and good nutrition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        The most important of these changes was the financial
        crises resulting from the severance of economic ties among
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>. Public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were
        challenged to transform the bulky, state-sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX>.
        With high inflation and unemployment, they also suffered
        from shortages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, hospital supplies, and
        essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Provision of basic public health services
        were compromised, including repairing antiquated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and
        sewer systems, resulting in increased risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastroenteritis</ENAMEX> and infections with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis A</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ;
        the largest documented outbreak of typhoid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>
        occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tajikistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1997</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Practices
        such as reusing syringes during vaccination and poor
        sterilization procedures during dentistry have contributed
        to nosocomial outbreaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and a high prevalence of
        infections with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        The objective of this work was to assess the current
        status and functioning of various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX>, so as to guide
        reform efforts. At the invitation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministries of</ENAMEX>
        Health (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoHs</ENAMEX>), we performed assessments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republics of Kazakhstan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tadjikistan</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uzbekistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkmenistan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>, and in the Kyrgyz
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>. We found striking homogeneity in comparing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> to another; and, for clarity, we
        present here representative findings by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Armenian</ENAMEX>
        component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX> (AIDSS) as a prototype.
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Description of the AIDSS
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.3 million</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> gained its
          independence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 21, 1991</TIMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> regions, which are
          subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Responsibility
          for the AIDSS rests with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Hygiene and</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epidemiologic Surveillance</ENAMEX> - a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Armenian</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoH</ENAMEX> (AMoH) - composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> known as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanitary Epidemiologic Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stations of the SES</ENAMEX> parallel the geopolitical divisions
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>. There exists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in each
          district. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, except <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yerevan</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yerevan</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>, each with one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national SES</ENAMEX> is also located in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yerevan</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX>, 
          per se, developed from a model
          created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1800s</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">russia</ENAMEX> and uniformly
          developed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>.
          Its principle functions are to collect and analyze public
          health surveillance data and to implement and enforce
          strategies for the prevention and control of infectious
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Traditionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of
          the entire medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-power and budget of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX>,
          and was separate from the curative medical care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> was staffed by epidemiologists
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>), microbiologists, sanitary hygienists, and
          other health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paramedics</ENAMEX> and physician
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assistants</ENAMEX>). The district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> was the basic public health
          unit that monitored infectious diseases, investigated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outbreaks</ENAMEX>, attended to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and adolescent health,
          inspected the food-service industry, monitored water
          purity, and dealt with occupational and environmental
          health problems throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . City-,
          regional-, and national-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administrations</ENAMEX> were
          larger, with specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> collected infectious diseases data from all
          health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Before
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> had a comprehensive and free health-care
          delivery system accessible to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> with health
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> and health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> employed under the
          auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX>. Outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> (village
          health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and polyclinics) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> reported to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-45</NUMEX> village health
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> polyclinics, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hospital. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> had variable numbers of polyclinics and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.
          Altogether, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">830</NUMEX> village health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">228</NUMEX> polyclinics, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from
          these health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> were reported to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> districts
          and city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> and then to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national SES</ENAMEX>, which
          forwarded aggregated data to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Hygiene</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epidemiologic Surveillance</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Objectives and Data</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reporting</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Analyses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX>
          The objectives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> were to identify cases of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious diseases</ENAMEX>, document outbreaks, and monitor
          trends in disease occurrence. It collected aggregated and
          case-based data on new cases of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> infectious diseases.
          This list included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> diseases with low pathogenicity
          (e.g., pediculosis and scabies) and some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> with
          inadequate or non-existent preventive measures (e.g.,
          infectious mononucleosis and parapertussis). There
          existed no tiered (e.g., confirmed, probable, and
          suspected) standardized case definitions. The reporting
          of confirmed or suspected cases of some infectious
          diseases required immediate reporting via telephone or in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-24 hours</TIMEX>. These included epidemic prone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polio</ENAMEX>, plague).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> from the
          district to national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX>. Reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national SES</ENAMEX>
          were sent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX> and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX>
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX> and back to the district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The
          district and city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> reported immediately to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national SES</ENAMEX>.
          At all levels, epidemiologists used descriptive
          statistics for data analyses. These included the
          calculation of aggregated case numbers and incidence and
          prevalence rates based on estimates of the population
          size provided by the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> charged with gathering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">census</ENAMEX> data; limited stratification by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, time, and
          place; and the assessment of trends. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiologists</ENAMEX> did
          not use analytic methods to assess risk factors for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, even though they were collected.
          Cases and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> of every <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> were investigated
          by a district or city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epidemiologist</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>
          of the receipt of the case report, using a standardized
          form known as the 
          epid carta. This form was not
          disease specific, yet lengthy (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> questions, many of
          which required subjective responses). Little or no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX> was provided to the original reporting sources
          and no routine or formal sharing of data and information
          occurred between the district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> and health-care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1summarizes</ENAMEX> the public health practice
          activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>, stratified by health facility.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qualitative Attributes</ENAMEX>
          
            Simplicity
            Referring to both its structure and ease of
            operation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> was complex. Epidemiologists
            gathered voluminous information on each case; parallel
            vertical public health programs reported duplicative
            information; much time was required to collect,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">register</ENAMEX>, and report case information; and many staff
            maintained the system.
          
          
            Flexibility and Acceptability
            Addressing the extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> could adapt
            to changing information needs or operating conditions
            and reflecting the willingness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to
            provide information and monitor the system, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX>,
            itself, determined both its flexibility and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptability</ENAMEX>. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX> provided salaries for
            health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, it could enforce compulsory
            reporting, through monetary fines and professional
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">demotions</ENAMEX>. Changes in reportable conditions or criteria
            were made rapidly because administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES employees</ENAMEX>
            carried out orders quickly and completely at all levels
            in the system.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quantitative Attributes</ENAMEX>
          
            Sensitivity
            Assessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX>'s ability to account for all
            incidents of a disease (i.e., the proportion of cases
            detected, correctly diagnosed, and reported), we
            learned that detection of most reportable infectious
            conditions did come to medical attention. This was
            enhanced because all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> received free health care
            and because primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> were responsible
            for care (including community outreach) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in
            their assigned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX>. However, due to constrained
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, laboratory confirmation of reportable
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious diseases</ENAMEX> was limited in practice. As such,
            reporting was based on clinical or epidemiologic,
            rather than laboratory information.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predictive Value Positive</ENAMEX>
            The likelihood that a disease report constituted a
            true case of that disease was diminished because of the
            lack of laboratory confirmation and standardized case
            definitions.
          
          
            Representativeness
            We felt that, ideally, the AIDSS accurately
            described the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in the
            population by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, time, and place because disease
            reporting was mandatory and failure to report was a
            punishable offense. And, because of the penalties, all
            official reporting to the national level did occur on a
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> basis. However, it was common practice for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiologists</ENAMEX> to conceal cases of infectious disease
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">willfully underreport</ENAMEX> epidemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX>, because
            outbreaks meant that the epidemiologists were not
            performing their duties of preventing and controlling
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious diseases</ENAMEX>. This paradox resulted in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiologists</ENAMEX> managing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of information: one
            officially reported to higher-ups and one unofficially
            kept (with more accurate numerators).
          
          
            Timeliness
            Information for action or for long-term planning was
            available because mandatory reporting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> within
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-24 hours</TIMEX> of diagnosis for most conditions under
            surveillance allowed rapid implementation of control
            and prevention measures.
          
          
            Costs
            Because budgets were relatively non-existent in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>, historical data on the costs of operating the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> were not available. In the FSU centrally planned
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, resources were obtained from cost centers
            (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> were not metered, office supplies were
            requested by quantity and not cost, and salaries were
            provided from the central budget). However, numerous
            observations led us to conclude that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> was
            relatively inefficient and costly; in large part,
            because the expenditure was paid from the public
            sector.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> was labor intensive. Being paper-driven,
            reporting dieases for which no practical public health
            interventions exist misallocated scarce resources.
            Other common public health activities with high
            opportunity cost in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> were indiscriminate
            disinfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and work sites. Environmental
            background monitoring practices by district and
            regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> included routine collection of specimens
            and laboratory testing (e.g., air and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water samples</ENAMEX>,
            food products, and items that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> may come in
            contact with such as toys or eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utensils</ENAMEX>) in
            addition to evaluation of physical factors (noise,
            vibration, microclimate, electromagnetic fields, levels
            of lighting, and ionic radiation) at several sites
            (e.g., work places and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">day-care centers</ENAMEX>).
            When cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis A</ENAMEX>, acute gastroenteritis,
            tuberculosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX>, or pediculosis were reported,
            disinfection of homes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">day-care centers</ENAMEX> and
            work places was conducted by public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who
            used chloramine application and steam cleaning of all
            hard surfaces and laundering of all clothing and
            bedding materials. The effectiveness of such
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disinfection</ENAMEX> practices or environmental background
            monitoring has not been documented, and is likely of
            doubtful public health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>.
            During disease outbreaks, it was common practice to
            investigate every case and culture all available
            materials, and decontamination efforts were instituted
            regardless of epidemiologic evidence. It was common
            practice to hospitalize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> < <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX> of age
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-14 days</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of all ages
            with acute gastroenteritis for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-15 days</TIMEX>. It was also
            common to hospitalize both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis A</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX>, with syphilis for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>,
            with gonorrhea for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX>, and with tuberculosis
            for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>. These isolation practices, meant to
            prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> transmission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, were
            consequences of central planning in which emphasis was
            placed on input indicators such as the occupancy rates
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Incentives (budget allocations) placed on
            input rather than output measures led to a level of
            medical infrastructure that has been difficult to
            maintain given current levels of funding available for
            the health sector.
            Because financial issues were a major driving
            factor, cost analyses of surveillance practices and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> measures could identify areas for cost-savings.
            Analyses of the surveillance system in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX> (using
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX>) revealed that excessive culturing
            represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> of the cost 
            per capita expenditure of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L'viv Regional SES</ENAMEX> and disinfection procedures
            accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 30%</NUMEX> of the entire Pustomity
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District SES</ENAMEX>'s budget (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Carande-Kulis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>, personal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>).

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">• Eliminate</ENAMEX> punitive consequences to obtain accurate
            reporting;
            • Restrict the number of routinely reportable
            diseases based on measures of mortality, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">severity</ENAMEX>, communicability, and preventability;
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">• Categorize</ENAMEX> events under surveillance into a

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">○</ENAMEX> case-based (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX>); and
            ○ indicator-based (e.g., number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
            immunized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years of age</TIMEX>);
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">• Simplify</ENAMEX> reporting procedures and forms by
            ○ limiting urgent reporting of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> to those
            that require prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of control
            measures;

            in a timely fashion (e.g., via a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> public health
            bulletin). A bulletin could include descriptions of
            important outbreak investigations, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-specific
            analyses of surveillance data, graphic and tabular
            information on selected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, indicators of
            community health, and recommendations for public health
            concerns.
          
        
        
          Current HIS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform</ENAMEX> Efforts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>
          This assessment stimulated and guided reform efforts
          that were initiated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1992</TIMEX> through a
          cooperative project among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Agency</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Development</ENAMEX> (USAID), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>. This
          project provided technical and material assistance toward
          reform of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> HIS. The approach focused on
          training a cohort of public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiologists</ENAMEX> in the modern aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epidemiology</ENAMEX>,
          biostatistics, surveillance techniques, and scientific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>; developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>-specific case
          definitions; facilitating HIS reform strategies through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workshops</ENAMEX> and training sessions; and developing the
          capacity to publish an epidemiologic bulletin.
          Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, this HIS reform activity has been
          self-sustained with no additional monetary support from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAID</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMoH</ENAMEX> created a national HIS
          program for the development and reform of the HIS and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armenian National Health Analytic-Information Centre</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          ] . The system has been transformed into a comprehensive
          HIS and includes chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, maternal and child
          health, and injury data. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diseases</ENAMEX> are now categorized by
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-tiered approach: disease elimination (e.g.,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polio</ENAMEX>), case-based (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diphtheria</ENAMEX>) and indicator-based
          (e.g., number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> immunized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">age</ENAMEX>).
          Preparations are now being made for additional
          training and to assess and improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> case diagnoses,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and recording, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> records. New
          regional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> equipped with computers and faxes have
          been organized for the collection, analyses, and
          reporting of health information. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> and regional
          public health bulletins are being published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> languages - <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> - and
          distributed to wide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>. Tiered, standardized case
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX> and essential health indicators for
          decision-making at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> and community level have
          been developed and disseminated. These include health
          status, performance, and resource indicators.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive</ENAMEX> HIS reform is critical throughout the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>. Timely, accurate, and relevant health information
          are necessary to assess the burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and
          disability; understand changing health patterns; measure
          the needs for and improve services; address inequities in
          health; provide information for policy formulation and
          planning; and provide a basis for intra- and
          international comparisons on health status and care
          utilization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Timeliness, accuracy, and relevancy
          are augmented by efficiency. Integrating all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> into one comprehensive HIS prevents duplicate
          recording and reporting across services and programs,
          averts labor-wasting inefficiencies, and saves scarce
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.
          A comprehensive HIS includes the capacity to obtain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from vital registries, clinical, administrative, and
          other records; from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based surveys
          and sentinel systems for infectious and chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>,
          and disabilities; and maternal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> health,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX>, and program implementation indicators,
          including access, coverage, and service quality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          This reform activity should include the development of an
          indicator monitoring system based on selected essential,
          action-oriented indicators of health status, service
          performance, and resources that can be used for
          decision-making at the local level.
        
      
      
        Summary
        We found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> to be a complex and sensitive, yet
        costly and inefficient surveillance system for infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Despite the lack of standardized case
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX>, feedback of information, and computer
        technology, it functioned fairly well before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. However,
        the functioning and continuation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> has been
        affected both directly and indirectly by events of the past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>.
        Overall, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> was useful because it detected
        cases of infectious diseases, estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX>,
        monitored trends in disease occurrence, and documented
        outbreaks. The comprehensive no-cost health-care delivery
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and compulsory reporting of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> to the AMoH
        enhanced its flexibility, representativeness, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timeliness</ENAMEX>. The strengths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDSS</ENAMEX> stemmed from the
        large numbers of health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and trained personnel
        and the separation of preventive from curative medicine,
        that secured an independent status (including separate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preventive medicine</ENAMEX> and public health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> also had weaknesses. Though the system
        meticulously tracked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> (from birth to death), very
        few of these data were computerized, analyzed, or used to
        develop, direct, or evaluate public health policy. In most
        cases, when used, data guided regulation and punishment
        rather than public health decision-making. Simply put, data
        were used to fix blame and punish rather than to find and
        implement effective interventions.
        Epidemiologists were motivated to perform actions that
        both pleased their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> and avoided the punishment
        of monetary loss or demotion. For example, it was common
        practice for epidemiologists to hide select cases of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">willfully underreport</ENAMEX> epidemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> because outbreaks meant that the epidemiologists
        were not performing their duties of preventing and
        controlling infectious diseases. These disincentives to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thoroughness</ENAMEX> and honesty resulted in surveillance data and
        reports that did not reflect true incidence and prevalence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, circumstances, needs, responses, or impacts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> was but a component of the systems
        designed for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSU</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDSS</ENAMEX> did not address
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX>-specific needs. Further, because of the lack of
        tiered, standardized case definitions, there existed a
        potential for misclassification of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Lack of
        feedback to reporting sources hampered improvements in
        clinical practice. Monitoring conditions for which there
        were no practical public health interventions, the
        multi-tiered and duplicative reporting processes, and the
        use of expensive and indirect monitoring and control
        measures such as excessive culturing, disinfection, and
        prolonged hospitalization led to waste of resources. As a
        result, the system did not guide control measures optimally
        nor use resources efficiently.
        As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX> of the FSU embrace various aspects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">democratization</ENAMEX>, improvement of public health surveillance
        systems such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDSS</ENAMEX> should be a goal if decision
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> are to use credible data for informed public health
        practice.
