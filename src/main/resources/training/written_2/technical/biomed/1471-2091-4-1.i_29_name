        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glycosaminoglycans</ENAMEX> (GAGs) are negatively charged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polysaccharides</ENAMEX> derived from an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hexose</ENAMEX>. They are
        structural and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modulators</ENAMEX> of extracellular
        matrices that play important roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> development and
        repair. They exhibit both stimulatory and inhibitory
        influences on neurite outgrowth and survival. Evidence
        demonstrates the ability of heparin sulfates (HSs) to bind
        to growth/trophic factors and selectively regulate such
        factors' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . They can act as co-receptors
        of growth/trophic and survival factors to regulate cell
        behavior and/or restrict diffusion and create a relatively
        high local concentration of ligand.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pigment epithelium-</ENAMEX>derived factor (PEDF) is an
        extracellular neuronal differentiation and survival factor
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> derived from the retina and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. It induces
        neuronal differentiation in retinoblastoma cells, protects
        retina neurons (including photoreceptors) from death by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and other insults, and has a morphogenetic effect
        on photoreceptor cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . It also has
        neurotrophic effects on neurons from the cerebellum,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> and spinal cord [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . In the
        intact retina, this factor is identified as a secreted
        protein associated by ionic interactions with the
        interphotoreceptor matrix [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> are the
        major polyanionic components.
        Biochemically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-kDa</NUMEX> glycoprotein with
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the serine-protease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> (serpin) superfamily [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 15</ENAMEX> ] . However, it has
        no inhibitory effects on proteases. Its neurotrophic
        activities are independent of its protease inhibition
        potential but dependent on its interaction with
        cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 12 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> has high
        binding affinity for cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoblastoma Y</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        
          d 
         = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> nM), which is mediated by interactions between a
        region spanning amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> positions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78-121</NUMEX> of the PEDF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX> and the extracellular domains of the receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Blockage of these interactions inhibits
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> neurotrophic effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> also has binding
        affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX>, such as, heparin, heparin- and
        chondroitin-sulfates, but this affinity is ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX>-fold lower
        than for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        
          d 
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> Î¼M for the heparin-PEDF interactions) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19</NUMEX> ] .
        The binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> is mediated by ionic interactions
        between an area clustered with positively charged lysines
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> and the negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX>. In the PEDF
        spatial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, the putative GAG binding domain is
        distinct from and non-overlapping with the neurotrophic
        active region [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 20</NUMEX> ] .
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> coexists with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> in extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrices</ENAMEX> and has binding affinity for them, it is of
        interest to investigate the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> on PEDF activity.
        Given that binding to cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is the first
        step in the biological activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>, we used human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoblastoma Y</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> cells and their conditioned media (CM)
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF receptors</ENAMEX> and extracellular
        matrix components, respectively, to examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> content
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> and their effects on PEDF ligand-receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. The data suggest that heparan sulfate
        participates in the formation of a PEDF binding complex
        with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, and constitutes a positive
        modulator for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF-</ENAMEX>receptor interactions.
      
      
        Results
        
          Complex formation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> and component(s) in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> conditioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> cells
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> interacts with component(s)
          in media conditioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> cells (CM), we
          used an ultrafiltration assay. In this assay, soluble
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-kDa is filtered through a membrane with an
          exclusion limit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MW 100,000</NUMEX>, however it is retained
          upon formation of a complex larger than this limit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
          . The binding reactions were with a given 125I-PEDF
          concentration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX>. Incubations were at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> to minimize
          enzymatic degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and glycosaminglycans
          during the reaction. We found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125I</NUMEX>-PEDF was
          retained by the membrane in the presence of concentrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 4%</NUMEX> retention in the presence of
          defined medium (non-conditioned medium) concentrated in
          an identical fashion. Specific retention, termed PEDF
          bound, was calculated by subtracting the retention in
          defined media from that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1shows</TIMEX> that PEDF
          was specifically retained when mixed with soluble
          conditioned media and the value for PEDF bound increased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proportionally</ENAMEX> to the concentration factor of the media
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Interestingly, protease treatment of the CM
          did not abolish the binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). These observations
          revealed that the retained forms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> were PEDF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">complexes â‰¥ 100-kDa</ENAMEX>, and that the majority of these
          complexes were formed with soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CM</ENAMEX> components other
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heparin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> in the conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with
          affinity for PEDF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> and polyanions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> were fractionated by
          anion-exchange column chromatography followed by
          PEDF-affinity column chromatography (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The GAG
          content was followed by staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toluidine Blue-O</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C,2D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX>). The final <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction</TIMEX> (CM PEDF) contained
          components with binding affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> that stained
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toluidine Blue</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and migrated as high molecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weight GAGs</ENAMEX>.
          To determine the type of sulfated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, we
          designed a spectrophotometric assay using heparinase and
          heparitinase, specific degrading enzymes for heparin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The activities of both GAG
          lyases reached a plateau by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> of incubation (Figs.
          3A,3C) and the degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> substrates between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0-30</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼g</ENAMEX> was linear. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM PEDFcontained</ENAMEX> substrates
          for heparinase and heparitinase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Figs.</ENAMEX> 3B,3<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). The amount
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> was determined by comparison of the amount of Î”
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-hexuronate</NUMEX> produced with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CM samples</ENAMEX> to the standard
          curves with commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAGs</ENAMEX>. The estimated content of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> in CM varied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 12.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.7</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml for heparin and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-10 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>ml for HS-like molecules, among media
          conditioned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different batches of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> cells. The
          estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG</ENAMEX> content in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PEDFranged 0.2-1.8 Î¼g/Î¼l</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/Î¼l</ENAMEX> for heparin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX>, respectively. Similar
          assays were followed with chondroitinase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, but its
          substrates, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Î”Di4S</TIMEX>, dermatan and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”Di6S</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> were below
          detection limits. These results demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> and
          CM PEDFcontained heparin- and HS-like molecules,
          demonstrating that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> cells produced GAGs with binding
          affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> conditioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> cells enhances
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">125I</NUMEX>-PEDF binding to cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          We have demonstrated previously that biologically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">active 125I-PEDF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binds</ENAMEX> specifically, competitively and
          with high affinity to cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Because the reaction conditions were
          identical to those used for biological assays, the
          binding reactions were performed in the presence of media
          conditioned by the cells for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 hours</TIMEX> (CM). We
          investigated the effect of components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX>, a source
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF-</ENAMEX>receptor
          interactions using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> and non-conditioned defined media
          in radioligand binding assays. Comparison of reactions in
          the absence and presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> showed that the specific
          PEDF-binding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.8</NUMEX>-fold
          higher with conditioned medium than with defined medium
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Note that with the binding method used, the
          amount of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125I</NUMEX>-PEDF retained in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> without cells is the
          same to the amount of non-specific 125I-PEDF binding
          (reactions with cells and in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-fold
          molar excess of unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , indicating
          retention by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEI</ENAMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass-fiber</ENAMEX> filters of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF-receptor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG-PEDF-</ENAMEX>receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> rather than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF-GAG</ENAMEX>. Similar results were obtained when the
          cell-bound 125I-PEDF was separated by centrifugation,
          rather than filtration through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass-fiber</ENAMEX> filters, and
          comparing reactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> versus those with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (data not shown). These observations showed that a
          component(s) secreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> cells enhanced
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF-</ENAMEX>receptor interactions.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> lyases and chlorate on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125I</NUMEX>-PEDF
          binding to cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          To deplete the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-79 cell cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> and
          heparin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX>, we used heparitinase and heparinase,
          respectively. The cultures were pretreated with each GAG
          lyase before using them in radioligand binding assays.
          The morphology and viability of the cells were not
          affected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> lyase treatments. Figure 5Ashows
          that specific 125I-PEDF binding decreased significantly
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heparitinase</ENAMEX> treated cultures compared to untreated
          controls, and less drastically in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heparinase</ENAMEX> treated
          ones. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hyaluronidase</ENAMEX> treatment to deplete the cultures of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyaluronan</ENAMEX> did not have an effect on the binding. These
          results demonstrated that removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heparin</ENAMEX>/HS from the
          cell cultures decreased the PEDF binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlorate</ENAMEX> is a competitive inhibitor of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-sulfurylase, and inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> sulfation in cell
          cultures can be achieved by pretreatment of the cultures
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mM sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undersulfated GAGs</ENAMEX> on the PEDF binding to its receptor
          was examined. Cells pretreated with sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorate</ENAMEX> did
          not show changes in viability or morphology; however, the
          treatment resulted in a decrease in the specific
          125I-PEDF binding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 35%</NUMEX> relative to untreated
          controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). Sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfate</ENAMEX> was used to recover
          the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> sulfation by chlorate increasing the
          binding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> maximal with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM sulfate additions. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> revealed that inhibition of sulfation of GAGs
          reduced the PEDF binding to cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> cells, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20%</NUMEX> of specific inhibition. Thus,
          these observations implied that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS/heparin</ENAMEX> might play a
          functional role in the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> to its
          cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        It has been proposed that the GAG-binding property of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> provides the molecular basis for its association with
        extracellular matrices and may serve to localize PEDF
        activity in the retina and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 19</NUMEX> ] . However, the
        present results point to direct effects these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysaccharides</ENAMEX> might have on the biochemical interactions
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF receptors</ENAMEX> on the surfaces of cells
        that respond to this neurotrophic factor. We have shown
        that the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in retinoblastoma
        cells is enhanced by the presence of extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heparin/HS</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX>, which can be found in the culture
        medium of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> cells. The fact that the binding
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> to cell surfaces decreases with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heparin</ENAMEX>/HS
        depletion, implies that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heparin</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HS</ENAMEX> molecules might act as
        cofactors for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF-</ENAMEX>receptor interactions. Interactions
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> and extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> can also explain the
        complex formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> even after protease
        treatment of the latter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF-heparin/HS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may
        somehow facilitate encounters between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">receptor,</ENAMEX> 
        e.g. , by inducing a conformational
        change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>, which might accelerate the ligand-receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may also form a
        complex with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heparin</ENAMEX>/HS to facilitate interactions with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX>.
        To our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report on the
        production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retinoblastoma</ENAMEX> cells. We found that
        these cells produce <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HS</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heparin</ENAMEX> secreted into the culturing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>. The retina and malignant solid tumors also produce
        the sulfated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSs</ENAMEX> are
        mostly found as proteoglycans associated with the basal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamina</ENAMEX> or the plasma membrane, the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSs</ENAMEX> in the
        culturing medium might be a result of shedding or release
        of their extracellular domains from the cell membranes as
        soluble components. Cell-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> proteoglycans can
        undergo regulated shedding from the membrane into the
        soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> or culturing medium converting
        the membrane anchored molecules into soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">effectors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . In the conditioned media of all the tested batches of
        retinoblastoma cells, we detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heparin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> with
        binding affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>. The estimated concentrations of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> may vary with cell density and
        conditioning time. However, under the conditions used, they
        were within the linear range of HS-PEDF complex formation (
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        The fact that depletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heparin</ENAMEX>/HS-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> from the
        culturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> results in inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> binding to
        cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> points to functional roles for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAGs</ENAMEX> such as those of positive modulators of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF-</ENAMEX>receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. In this regard, we observed that depletion
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-79 cell cultures of heparin with heparinase was
        lower than those depleted of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> with heparitinase,
        suggesting that the retinoblastoma-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> was more
        effective than the retinoblastoma-derived heparin. This
        observation can be explained by structural, compositional
        and functional differences between heparin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS GAGs</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAG-binding proteins</ENAMEX> can be differentially sensitive to
        variations in GAG structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> produced among
        different cell types have structural and compositional
        differences and structural changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> are known to
        occur in cells undergoing morphological differentiation
        and/or malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">transformations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30 31</NUMEX> ] . Thus, in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native retina</ENAMEX>, or other tissue, modulation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF-</ENAMEX>receptor interactions may depend on the expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX>, which occur during development and pathological
        conditions.
        Our data offer interesting possibilities of regulation
        of the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>. The ratio and amount of production
        of heparin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> bearing PEDF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may be an
        important mechanism to control the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> as is
        the modulation of the rate of expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEDF receptors</ENAMEX>.
        The data obtained so far on the action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> on different
        cells may have not considered the presence of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cofactors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. The binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> that
        modulate the binding of these factors to its receptor opens
        also the possibility that different GAGs may modulate
        differently the affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, by
        increasing or even decreasing it in some cases. Finally,
        the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> binding regions are on
        opposite regions of the PEDF molecule, suggest the
        possibility of the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> mutants or engineered
        variants that, having lost or decreased GAG-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capabilities</ENAMEX>, still show high affinity for the PEDF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in a way not dependent upon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GAGs</ENAMEX> content or
        composition. These possibilities are discussed under the
        consideration that some of them may have important
        implications if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>, or molecules derived from it, are to
        be used in the future as therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        The primary consequence of reducing the heparin<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/HS</ENAMEX> and
        its sulfation was to minimize a binding site required for
        PEDF activity. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> in the
        extracellular matrix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , a more direct mechanism
        appears necessary, namely, its participation in the binding
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. In a spatial structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heparin</ENAMEX>/HS binding domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> maps to the opposite
        side of the neurotrophic active <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , allowing
        distinct and non-overlapping interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heparin</ENAMEX>/HS
        on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and with the neurotrophic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> on its opposite side. Our data suggest that the
        intrinsic affinity of the cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for PEDF
        appears low, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heparin</ENAMEX>/HS-PEDF <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is
        recognized with high affinity. In addition, a direct
        interaction between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> may also be
        necessary. Although details of the mechanism remain to be
        revealed, it is clear that heparin<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/HS</ENAMEX> is required for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of the neurotrophic activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX>, namely the
        encounters with its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> at the cell surface. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and survival of cells in vivo may be
        regulated not only by the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDF</ENAMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> but also by the temporal and spatial expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX>.

          Radioligand binding assays
          PEDF binding to cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was assayed
          using biologically active radioligand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125I-PEDF</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] by a widely-used method with a mechanism of
          retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on polyethylenimine-treated
          glass-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> filters based mainly on ionic interactions [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . Polyethylenimine binds strongly to glass, which is
          negatively charged and integral membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> tend to
          be acidic. The resultant polycationic
          polyethylenimine-coated glass can retain cell membranes
          due to their negative charges. Because binding of
          cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylenimine</ENAMEX> filters is
          rather insensitive to ionic strength, the ionic
          phenomenon is thought to be supplemented by hydrophobic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and hydrogen binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The method used with
