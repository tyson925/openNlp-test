        Medulloblastomas, embryonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neoplasms</ENAMEX> arising in the
        cerebellum, are the most common malignant pediatric brain
        tumor. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> inherited syndromes associated with
        medulloblastomas have been described: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turcot's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorlin</ENAMEX>'s
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Fraumeni</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Fraumeni</ENAMEX> syndrome
        is caused by inherited mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p53</TIMEX> tumor
        suppressor gene. Affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> develop a large
        spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> and extra-CNS neoplasms, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulloblastomas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Interestingly, alterations in p53
        are relatively rare in sporadic medulloblastomas, with
        mutations detected in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> or less of cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        The genes most commonly altered in medulloblastoma are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of developmental signaling pathways. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorlin</ENAMEX>'s
        syndrome results from inherited mutations in the Hedgehog
        receptor 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTCH</ENAMEX> that constitutively activate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. Mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hedgehog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> members 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTCH</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PTCH 2 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUFU</ENAMEX> and 
        Smo , have all been identified in
        sporadic medulloblastomas as well, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25%</NUMEX>
        of cases containing mutations affecting these genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . A murine medulloblastoma model was recently
        developed by disruption of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTCH</ENAMEX> gene, with medulloblastoma-like
        tumors arising in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of heterozygotes by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 months</TIMEX> of
        age [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . Breeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">PTCH mice</ENAMEX> to p53 knockout animals
        markedly increased tumor incidence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice heterozygous</ENAMEX> for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTCH</ENAMEX> and lacking p53 all developed
        medulloblastomas by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months of age</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Turcot's syndrome</ENAMEX> is caused by germline mutations in the
        gene 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. This developmentally important pathway contains
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frizzled, Axin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GSK3</ENAMEX>,
        which act in concert to promote the proteosomal degradation
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-catenin</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . When 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> is rendered inactive by mutation,
        β-catenin levels rise and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> moves into the
        nucleus where it acts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tcf/Lef</ENAMEX> cofactors to regulate
        transcription of 
        c-myc , 
        cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and other oncogenes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        
        APC mutations have been identified in
        medulloblastoma cell lines and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 4%</NUMEX> of sporadic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulloblastomas</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, point mutations
        or small deletions in β- 
        catenin exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> have been identified
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of sporadic medulloblastomas and in supratentorial
        primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        Finally, large deletions in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AXIN</ENAMEX> were recently found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of
        sporadic medulloblastomas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In the absence of Wnt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling β</ENAMEX>-catenin is sequestered in the cytoplasm, and
        nuclear translocation of β-catenin has been used to monitor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation of the Wnt</ENAMEX> pathway in a number of different
        tumor types. We have previously shown that nuclear
        β-catenin is present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> of sporadic medulloblastomas [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] .
        The greatly increased incidence of medulloblastomas in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> inheriting mutations in the 
        APC <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene suggests
        that activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling could be sufficient in
        some cases to initiate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medulloblastoma</ENAMEX> formation. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitogenic</ENAMEX> role played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnts</ENAMEX> in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> development
        also supports the concept that the pathway could promote
        growth in the brain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . In order to test this
        hypothesis we created transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in which the Wnt
        pathway was aberrantly activated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>.
        In order to avoid possible 
        in utero lethality caused by excess
        pathway activity, we used the murine PrP promoter element
        to construct our transgenic lines. Wnt signaling is known
        to play a critical role in the development of the brain,
        and the midbrain and cerebellum do not form in animals
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lacking Wnt-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, targeted disruption of
        the 
        frizzled-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> gene results in cerebellar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Transgene expression from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is extremely low during embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, with high-level postnatal expression largely
        restricted to neurons and glia of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        Transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> expressing either wild-type or mutant
        β-catenin were generated so that a range of pathway
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> could be examined. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant β</ENAMEX>-catenin was
        stabilized by a serine to phenylalanine alteration in codon
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>, a change found in human tumors. We hypothesized that
        increased expression of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> might result in
        modest activation of the pathway, while expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>, stabilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> would increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling
        activity more significantly. The mutant β-catenin
        accumulated in neuronal nuclei in our transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, but
        no tumors or other microscopic abnormalities were detected.
        The lack of aberrant neuronal proliferation in our mice
        suggests that differentiated neurons may not be as
        susceptible to the mitogenic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling as
        are neuroepithelial progenitor cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patrice Morin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Cells were plated at a density of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mm plate. Transient transfections of
          β-catenin, β-galactosidase and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmids were
          performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fugene</ENAMEX> reagent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plating</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Molecular Biochemicals</ENAMEX>). Cells were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX>. All experiments were performed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quadruplicate</ENAMEX>. β-galactosidase and luciferase activities
          were measured using standard techniques. β-galactosidase
          activity was used to control for transfection
          efficiency.
        
        
          Transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>

          injection into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B6/SJL</ENAMEX> mouse embryos. Transgenic lines
          were established using standard methods at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopkins Transgenic Core Facility</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Human β-catenin exon 3</ENAMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> transgenic lines were established, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expressing
          wild-type human β-catenin (WT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>) and three expressing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human β</ENAMEX>-catenin stabilized by mutation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> site at residue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mut</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>). Levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgenic protein</ENAMEX> were evaluated by Western blot using
          antibodies directed against a FLAG sequence in the
          C-terminus of the transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Transgenic protein</ENAMEX> was expressed at high levels in the
          brains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and at lower levels
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein extracts</ENAMEX> prepared
          separately from the cerebral cortex and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cerebellum/brainstem</ENAMEX> had similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels (data not
          shown). Attempts to localize expression of the transgenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein immunohistochemically</ENAMEX> in brain tissue sections
          using anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FLAG antibodies</ENAMEX> were not successful. To
          evaluate overall expression levels of β-catenin
          (transgenic and endogenous) Western blots were probed
          with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> that binds both human and murine
          β-catenin. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT-1</ENAMEX> brains contained only modestly increased
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (data not shown). However, cerebellum
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-100%</NUMEX> more
          β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> than non-transgenic controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B).
          Some variation in β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level was seen
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, but this was not related to age and high
          expression levels were seen at all time points evaluated
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks to 12 months</TIMEX>; data not shown).
        
        
          Nuclear β-catenin in hippocampus, cortex and
          cerebellum of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          To determine whether expression of transgenic
          β-catenin resulted in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wnt</ENAMEX> pathway activity we
          analysed the subcellular distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-catenin</NUMEX> in the
          brain. Nuclear translocation of β-catenin is generally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling activity. Nuclear
          fractionation was performed and the amount of total
          β-catenin in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assayed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). Stains for the cytoplasmic protein
          HSP90 were used to evaluate fractionation and revealed
          some contamination of the nuclear fractions. Still, the
          amount of β-catenin appeared significantly increased in
          the nuclear fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CNS protein extracts</ENAMEX> from the
          Mut-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> transgenic line, and somewhat increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mut</ENAMEX>-2
          nuclear fractions.
          We also analysed β-catenin distribution
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemically</ENAMEX>. In non-transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> β-catenin
          is abundant in cytoplasm but excluded from hippocampal,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellar</ENAMEX> or cortical nuclei (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A,3C). In contrast,
          several of the transgenic lines contained numerous
          neurons with nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the hippocampus, cerebral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX> and cerebellum. Consistent with the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractionation</ENAMEX> experiments described above, nuclear
          β-catenin was most prominent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. In the
          cerebellum <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-40%</NUMEX> of the granule <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell nuclei</ENAMEX> were
          positive, and positive nuclei were also found scattered
          throughout the molecular layer (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Purkinje cell
          nuclei were negative. In the cortex, nuclei of many small
          to medium sized neurons were strongly positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D).
          Nuclear β-catenin was only rarely detected in glial
          cells, mostly those with oligodendroglial morphology.
          Strongly positive nuclei were also present in the dentate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gyrus</ENAMEX> and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. Mut-2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> contained scattered β-catenin positive nuclei in
          the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum, but fewer than
          were seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mut</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mut</ENAMEX>-3 animals <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-50%</NUMEX> of cerebellar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in the granule and molecular layers contained
          nuclear β-catenin, and hippocampal cells were
          occasionally positive, but the cortical neuronal nuclei
          were largely negative. The nuclei of hippocampal,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellar</ENAMEX> and cortical neurons in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WT-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WT-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          were also mostly negative for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-catenin</NUMEX>, although
          occasional weakly positive nuclei were seen in these two
          lines. No nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was seen in these structures
          in most non-transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, suggesting that weak
          activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling may occur with overexpression
          of wild type β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Nuclear β-catenin was
          detected in the thalami and other cortical deep grey
          matter loci in both transgenic and non-transgenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          In order to determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling was aberrantly
          active in the cerebellar neuroblasts thought to give rise
          to some medulloblastomas, β-catenin immunostains were
          performed on newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclei</ENAMEX> in
          the proliferating external granule cell layer of P0
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenics</ENAMEX> did not contain β-catenin. Nuclear β-catenin
          was also absent from the ventricular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone cells</ENAMEX> in P0
          transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Phenotypic analysis
          The most striking phenotype was the "kinking" of tails
          seen in lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A large
          percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had kinked tails, while
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX> line it was a rare finding. It is not clear
          why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-3</ENAMEX> line, which has lower levels of transgenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the cortex, was most susceptible to tail
          defects. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tail kinks</ENAMEX> ranged from single, acute bends to
          multiple angulations resembling knots (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Kinked
          tails were of normal length or slightly shortened.
          Radiographic analysis revealed vertebral bodies in the
          kinked regions to be attenuated in size or malformed.
          Peculiar circling or "waltzing" behaviors were also noted
          in many of the transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> spun in
          place or ran repetitively in tight circles for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 20</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> at a time. While the waltzing was most common in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice expressing mutant β</ENAMEX>-catenin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> non-transgenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> also exhibited a loose circling behavior.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> from each transgenic line as well as
          non-transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> were observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to identify
          any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with signs of tumors or other neurological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX>. However, uncoordinated movements,
          somnolence, or poor grooming, as is seen in PTCH animals
          developing tumors, were never observed. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant β</ENAMEX>-catenin and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> wild-type β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least nine months</TIMEX> before being sacrificed
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-2</ENAMEX> animals
          expressing high levels of mutant, stabilized β-catenin
          were observed for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> reaching
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 to 17 months of age</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed at the
          end of the observation period and their brains removed,
          but no tumors or other gross or microscopic CNS
          abnormalities were detected. While a number of transgenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first nine months</TIMEX>, the percentage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> surviving was not significantly different between
          the transgenic and non-transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Necropsies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> expiring prior to sacrifice failed
          to reveal brain tumors or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> alterations. Several
          of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had glomerulonephritis, but overall the
          causes of death were variable, and, except for tail
          kinking, no clear pattern of extra-CNS defects emerged in
          the transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          No increase in tumorigenesis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> mutant animals
          expressing transgenic β-catenin
          To increase the probability of brain tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, several transgenic lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WT-1</ENAMEX> and
          Mut-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>) were crossed onto a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-deficient background.
          No brain tumors were identified among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 WT-1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          Mut-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Mut-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that were <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> null.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> all died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within 9 months</TIMEX> from lymphomas or
          other extra-CNS neoplasms known to be associated with
          abrogation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> function. Brain tumors were also absent
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WT-1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8 Mut-3</ENAMEX> animals
          that were <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> heterozygous at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX> locus. All of the
          Mut-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mut-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> heterozygous for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> were observed
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 9 months</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> were observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 to 14</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have created transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> expressing either
        wild-type or mutant human β-catenin in differentiated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and glia of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. The mutant gene encodes
        β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> stabilized by alteration of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> site required for proteosomal degradation.
        In the transgenic line expressing high levels of human
        wild-type β-catenin, significant amounts of FLAG
        epitope-tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were detected, however overall
        β-catenin levels were only slightly increased, suggesting
        the mechanisms that normally regulate β-catenin level were
        able to compensate for the addition of the human transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In contrast, expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S37F mutant β</ENAMEX>-catenin
        resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-100%</NUMEX> increase in overall CNS β-catenin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels. Expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> seemed to be
        higher in selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuronal populations</ENAMEX>. β-catenin nuclear
        translocation was detected in a subset of hippocampal,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortical</ENAMEX> and cerebellar neurons normally lacking nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, consistent with activation of the canonical Wnt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> in these cells.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> lines of evidence suggest that the stabilized
        β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is biologically active and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promotes Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling. First, co-transfection of the cDNA
        used to make our transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPFLASH</ENAMEX> Wnt
        pathway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAOY</ENAMEX> medulloblastoma cells
        resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over forty-fold</NUMEX> induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> activity.
        Similar results were reported for this FLAG epitope-tagged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> in other cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the tail
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinking</ENAMEX> and "waltzing" phenotypes in our transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>
        expressing stabilized human β-catenin are highly similar to
        those seen in 
        Fused <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . 
        Fused encodes the murine Axin
        homologue, and mutation of this gene results in activation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The tail kinking in our animals
        presumably results from low level expression of the mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transgene</ENAMEX> 
        in utero during vertebral patterning.
        The circling behavior could be due either to ongoing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aberrant Wnt</ENAMEX> activity in the adult brain, or to subtle
        developmental defects that are not easily detectable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopically</ENAMEX>. We observed the tail and behavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX> in multiple transgenic lines, suggesting they
        are not caused by disruption of an endogenous gene by
        transgene integration.
        Our Western blot analysis showed that transgenic protein
        was expressed in the cortex and cerebellum from the
        earliest time point assayed, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> post-gestation,
        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months of age</TIMEX>. As has been previously reported,
        in non-transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> we detected nuclear β-catenin
        only in the thalamus and other deep grey matter structures
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In transgenic lines expressing mutant, stabilized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear
        β-catenin in both internal granule layer (IGL) and
        molecular layer neurons of the cerebellum. Cortical neurons
        and hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells also contained
        nuclear β-catenin in transgenic but not non-transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. We also examined the subcellular localization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant β</ENAMEX>-catenin in newborn transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In these P0
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> we failed to identify nuclear β-catenin in the
        proliferative cells of the cerebellar external granule cell
        layer or in periventricular neuroblasts. Thus in our
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> activation appears to be
        limited to mature, postmitotic neurons.
        Wnt activation in the adult hippocampus, cortex and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellum</ENAMEX> did not result in tumors or other CNS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">malformations</ENAMEX>. Strain effects are unlikely to have played a
        role in this lack of a neoplastic phenotype, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
        the same background as the one we used have previously been
        shown to develop medulloblastomas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . We further
        attempted to induce CNS tumors by abrogating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> function
        in conjunction with transgenic β-catenin expression. The
        rational for this approach was the markedly increased
        incidence of medulloblastomas seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTCH</ENAMEX> heterozygotes
        deficient for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, and the enhanced intestinal adenoma
        phenotype of 
        p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">null</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> heterozygous 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Min mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 32</NUMEX> ] . We did not
        observe any significant phenotypic changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> of
        β-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">catenin</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> heterozygous or homozygous for
        disruption of the 
        p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX>. However, most of the
        β-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">catenin</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> heterozygous for 
        p53 were followed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 9 months</TIMEX>,
        and it is possible that some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> could develop
        tumors at a later age.
        In transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice expressing mutant β</ENAMEX>-catenin in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> or colon, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels similar to those we
        describe are sufficient to promote abnormal differentiation
        and tumors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> documented intestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyposis</ENAMEX> in β-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">catenin</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with a less than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold increase in β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level in the polyps [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> point out that because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> was
        only expressed in a fraction of cells in this tissue,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels are likely higher in some epithelial cells.
        A similar explanation can be applied to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, in which
        nuclear translocation of β-catenin was only detected in a
        fraction of neurons. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold increase of
        β-catenin level in the mammary glands of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        also results in aberrant differentiation and tumors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX>
        ] . Thus while it is possible that a greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in β-catenin level would have a neoplastic effect
        on adult neurons, evidence from other transgenic models
        suggests the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> could be
        sufficient for tumor promotion. Overall, our data suggest
        that activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling in adult cerebellar and
        cortical neurons may not be sufficient for formation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulloblastoma/PNET</ENAMEX>.
        Recent experiments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> support the
        idea that stabilized β-catenin expression in the postnatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> is not sufficient to initiate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCAS-TVA</ENAMEX> system they showed that overexpression
        of c-myc, but not of activated β-catenin, promoted the
        proliferation of neural progenitor cells 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro . In their 
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments expression was
        initiated in nestin positive cells postnatally via
        injection of β-catenin stabilized by a point mutation in
        codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Activation of the Wnt</ENAMEX> pathway in primitive
        neuroepithelial cells 
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">utero</TIMEX> results in a quite different
        outcome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chenn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> recently created transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        in which β-catenin stabilized by an amino-terminal
        truncation was expressed in subventricular zone precursor
        cells 
        in utero under control of the nestin
        promoter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Brains from these transgenic embryos
        contained increased numbers of periventricular
        neuroepithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> because a greater number of the
        precursors re-entered the cell cycle after mitosis. The
        cerebellar phenotype in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was not reported, and it
        is not clear if the aberrantly proliferating
        neuroepithelial precursors in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> represent a
        pre-neoplastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. These transgenic lines express
        β-catenin lacking the entire amino-terminal inhibitory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, and this truncating β-catenin mutation they may
        have an increased or changed activity compared to our
        construct. Alternatively, the contrast between the 
        in utero cortical changes reported by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chenn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> and the lack of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> phenotype in our mice
        or those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fults</ENAMEX> could indicate that the developmental
        stage of the neuroepithelial cells in which stabilized
        β-catenin is expressed is critical.
        In summary, we have expressed wild-type and mutant,
        stabilized human β-catenin in differentiated neurons and
        glia of adult transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. While expression of
        wild-type human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> does not significantly alter
        overall β-catenin levels, stabilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein accumulates</ENAMEX> in
        hippocampal, cortical and cerebellar neurons and
        translocates into their nuclei. The tail kinking in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is highly similar to the phenotype seen in Axin
        mutants with activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> signaling, indicating the
        β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expressed in our transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is
        functional. However, no tumors, pre-neoplastic changes or
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> morphologic alterations were detected, suggesting
        that postnatal aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wnt</ENAMEX> activation is not sufficient to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induce CNS</ENAMEX> tumorigenesis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. It is possible, however,
        that higher β-catenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels, or expression in
        undifferentiated precursor cells 
        in utero , would result in tumor
        formation.
