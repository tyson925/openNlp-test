        Sequence homology between the serotonin type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3</ENAMEX> receptor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-HT</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R), the nicotinic acetylcholine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (nAChR), the GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycine</ENAMEX> receptor
        suggests a large amount of structural similarity within
        this superfamily of ligand gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        This presumed structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> can be used to guide site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> mutagenesis studies of particular receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX>. On a gross level, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this superfamily
        assemble as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentameric receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In some cases,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can be assembled from a single subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-HT</ENAMEX> 
        3A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nicotinic Î±7 receptors</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 5 6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In other cases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> different subunits are
        required [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4 9</NUMEX> ] . The ligand binding site is thought to
        be formed at the junction between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Based on data obtained from affinity labeling and site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> mutagenesis studies, several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the
        nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine receptor</ENAMEX> have been implicated in
        ligand binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> essential loops appear to
        contribute to the binding site with the position of each
        loop differing slightly depending on whether the receptor
        is heteromeric or homomeric [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homomeric receptors</ENAMEX>
        such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±7</NUMEX> nAChR, the loops are identified as A, B, C,
        D, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E and F</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 11</ENAMEX> ] . The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that interact with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> presumably extend into the binding site from these
        loops. Subunits are composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> faces (+ and -) with the
        + face of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> forming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the binding site
        and the - face of another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> forming the complimentary
        side. Some binding loops (A, B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>) are present on the -
        face while the remaining loops (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) are present on the
        + face. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The individual amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that form
        binding interactions with the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> present on
        a ligand are likely to differ for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subtype</ENAMEX>,
        reflecting the specificity of a particular binding site,
        however, the overall structure of the binding domain may be
        similar even for binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with different ligand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificities</ENAMEX>. Identification of ligand specificity
        requires identification of both the location or structure
        of individual binding site loops and the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        present in a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subtype</ENAMEX>.
        The purpose of this study is to extend the information
        available from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Sequence</ENAMEX> homology and a presumed
        structural similarity to other ligand gated ion channels
        suggests that the E loop region of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> forms part of the ligand binding
        domain for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands. This region extends from
        Y140 to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">K153</NUMEX> and is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The homologous
        sequences of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative members</ENAMEX> of this family
        are also shown. In the center of this region is a critical
        glycine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that is thought to play a role in
        establishing a hairpin loop [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Recent x-ray
        crystallographic data obtained from an ACh binding protein
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>) shows a loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in this region resulting
        from a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> residue turn containing a glycine homologous to
        G147 of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> On either side of this putative
        turn region are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that have been identified as
        important to receptor binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        The formation of this loop structure brings amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> on
        either side of glycine into close proximity and may form a
        binding pocket that will accommodate one or more functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. In order to identify the interaction of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        in this binding loop with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands, we have constructed alanine
        mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> throughout this region and evaluated
        the alteration in binding affinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> different classes
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Our data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">identifies 3</ENAMEX> tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that appear to interact
        selectively with each structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and supports the
        existence of a loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in this region of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        All mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were tested for their ability to
        bind the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R antagonist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>. Table
        2shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        d values for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wildtype</ENAMEX> mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rs</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> alanine mutations we
        evaluated. [ 3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> is a potent antagonist of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wt 5-HT</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        d = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.98 Â± 0.12 nM</NUMEX>). This value agrees
        with published data for this compound [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . B 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> values range from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pmoles</ENAMEX>/mg
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E148A</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pmoles</ENAMEX>/mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> for
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K153A</NUMEX> mutation, indicating some variability in
        expression of the different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. In general, however,
        receptor expression was similar to that reported by other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 20 21 22</ENAMEX> ] . No detectable binding was
        observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G147A</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">V149A mutant receptors</ENAMEX>. For all
        other mutants, decreases in binding affinity (increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        d ) were observed although the magnitude
        of the change was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> fold in all cases. A bar
        graph showing the change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        d value resulting from each alanine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>. The largest decreases in
        binding affinity were observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142A</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX> fold, Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E148A</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX> fold) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q150A - K153A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 - 8</ENAMEX> fold).
        Inhibition binding assays were also conducted. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> test
        compounds with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> representative of the major
        classes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands were chosen: serotonin
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, the endogenous agonist), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m -chlorophenylbiguanide</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX>, agonist), 
        d -tubocurarine ( 
        d -tc, antagonist) and lerisetron
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">antagonist</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i values for inhibition of [
        3H]granisetron binding by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> are shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Little change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i value was observed for the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. The values highlighted in bold in Table
        3represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i values for inhibition of [
        3H]granisetron binding on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptors</ENAMEX> that increased
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> fold compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i obtained for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wildtype receptors</ENAMEX>. The
        bar chart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Billustrates</NUMEX> the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i resulting from each mutation on the
        test compounds. Ratios of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i are shown as positive for increases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptors</ENAMEX> versus wildtype
        and negative for decreases. A positive change thus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a decrease in binding affinity for the
        compound as a result of the mutation. Large decreases in
        binding affinity were observed for select compounds only on
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y140A</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142A and Y152A</TIMEX> mutations.
        A more detailed analysis of the competition binding data
        obtained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y140A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142A and Y152A</TIMEX> mutations is shown
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y142A</TIMEX> mutation produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>
        fold increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y152A</ENAMEX> produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> fold increase.
        No change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i was observed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y140A</TIMEX> mutation
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R agonist 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> showed a similar profile for
        the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i values resulting from mutations of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tyrosines (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). As was observed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, the
        Y142A mutation produced a large increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> fold) while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y14 0A</ENAMEX> and Y152A
        mutations produced only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 24</NUMEX> fold changes
        respectively.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i value for 
        d -tc inhibition of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> was altered only slightly by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y142A</TIMEX> or Y152A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fold changes respectively). The
        Y140A mutation, however, produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> fold increase in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i compared to wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (Figure
        4C).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i value for lerisetron inhibition of [
        3H]granisetron binding was increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> fold by the Y142A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> fold by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y152A</TIMEX> mutation. Only a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX>
        fold change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i resulted from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y140A</TIMEX> mutation.
        Lerisetron was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> for which a large increase
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i was observed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y152A</TIMEX> mutation
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4D</NUMEX>). This mutation produced smaller changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> fold for both) and only a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fold change for 
        d -tc.
        In whole cell patch clamp studies, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT perfusion of
        cells transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y140A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y142A cDNA</ENAMEX> produced no
        responses at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1</NUMEX> mM although
        specific binding to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was identified in
        receptor binding studies. Unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140A and Y142A</TIMEX>, Y152A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> responded to application of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT. Due to the low
        potency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT on these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, only a portion of the
        concentration response curve could be determined (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> value was estimated as greater than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">370 Î¼M</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This value shows a greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> fold
        increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> compared to wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>; a
        larger change than was observed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> fold). The most dramatic change
        observed for whole cell currents was an alteration in the
        kinetics of the response elicited by application of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT.
        Y152A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptors</ENAMEX> displayed much slower rise times
        compared to wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> at all concentrations
        tested. Peak wt responses were typically obtained in less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ms while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Y152A</NUMEX> responses required <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several seconds</TIMEX>
        to plateau. Desensitization kinetics were also altered.
        While wt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> desensitized rapidly, mutant receptors
        showed no desensitization during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> s perfusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        The putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>loop region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGIC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> is homologous to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues Y140</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K153</TIMEX> in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 12 13 14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Structure-function studies of this region have been
        conducted in several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        receptors including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> 
        A and nAChR subtypes. In each case,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> have been identified that alter either the binding
        of selective ligands or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 11 12 13 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . In order to determine if this loop also
        contains residues critical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or function of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R, we have constructed alanine
        mutations of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> throughout the homologous region
        of the mouse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and investigated the affects on
        binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> different structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands. We have identified three
        tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that appear to play a role in binding of
        selective ligands to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. In addition, our data
        support the existence of a loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in this region as
        has been hypothesized for the nAChR and identified in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologous AChBP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> major structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands were tested on all mutants
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These ligands include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> [
        3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>, 
        d -tc and lerisetron, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">agonists 5-HT</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX>. Most of the mutations tested
        produced only minor changes in binding affinity for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX>. Large changes in binding are only apparent on
        Y140A, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y142A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y152A receptors</ENAMEX> for select ligands. The
        resulting effects of individual mutations are specific to
        particular structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of ligands. The Y140A
        mutation altered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for 
        d -tc inhibition, but did not alter
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i obtained for any other compound
        tested, while Y142A altered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and lerisetron but had
        little if any effect on inhibition by 
        d -tc. These data indicate the highly
        specific nature of the effects introduced by the alanine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> and appear to reflect specific changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ligand/receptor interaction.</ENAMEX>
        Binding of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> is altered only slightly by
        the alanine mutations introduced in this study (<<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        fold). This result indicates the lack of involvement of
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in this binding loop in the binding of [
        3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>. It is apparent, however, that [
        3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> does occupy the same binding cleft as other
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands as evidenced by the ability
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX>, 
        d -tc and lerisetron to displace it
        from the binding site. The lack of any large change in
        binding of granisetron supports our contention that there
        is little global structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perturbation</ENAMEX> of the binding
        site resulting from the introduction of each individual
        alanine mutation.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for inhibition of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron
        binding by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT was increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> fold by the Y142A
        mutation. A similar increase was also observed for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> fold). In contrast, the
        Y140A and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y152A mutations</ENAMEX> produced relatively small changes
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i . Since both compounds are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R agonists, they are likely to share
        the same binding interactions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these interactions
        appears to be with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX>. Other studies have also identified
        binding site interactions for agonists. R91, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E106</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F107</TIMEX>,
        W183 and several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> adjacent to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">M1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> have
        all been demonstrated to alter the action of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and/or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 25 26</NUMEX> ] . Within the
        crystal structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>, homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are
        located in the apparent binding site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The effects
        of agonist on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R are mediated by their interaction
        with these binding site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, resulting in stable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor conformations</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        Identification of interacting amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and their
        location in the tertiary structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may
        provide clues to the mechanism of channel opening. For
        example, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids homologous</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and W183</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R104</ENAMEX> and
        W143 respectively) are in close proximity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>,
        although on complementary faces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subunits</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . Spier 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> . have suggested that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W183</TIMEX> may
        be involved in a cation-Ï€ interaction with the amino group
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">W183</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y142</ENAMEX> are
        located near each other but on opposite faces of the
        binding site in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R, then they could potentially act in
        concert to help stabilize a conformation of the receptor
        leading to channel opening.
        
        d -Tubocurarine inhibition was
        uniquely altered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y140A</TIMEX> mutation. An increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> fold was observed for 
        d -tc on this mutant. Little if any
        change resulted for any other mutation. Thus, while 
        d -tc may form an interaction with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> at this binding loop, it appears to interact
        with Y140 rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX>. This difference in
        binding site interactions of the antagonist 
        d -tc and the agonists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> could be the result of a
        slightly different positioning of 
        d -tc in the binding site. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">antagonists</ENAMEX> 
        d -tc and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> also
        interact differently with this region since [
        3H]granisetron binding was not altered by mutations at any
        of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> tested. While the binding of 
        d -tc appears to involve some
        interaction with this binding loop, the binding of [
        3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> does not. Previous studies have indicated a
        point of overlap between [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> and 
        d -tc at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">W89</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . These studies indicate
        that the binding regions for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> are
        partially overlapping at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX> but not at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140</TIMEX>. In addition
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140 and W89</TIMEX>, 
        d -tc has also been observed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interact with D206</ENAMEX> and several other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in loop C [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] . The 
        d -tc binding site appears to involve
        interaction with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> different binding loops (A,
        E and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>) although additional interacting amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> may be
        found. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> obtained for 
        d -tc is particularly valuable due to
        the rigid nature of this molecule. Determination of
        interacting functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and their relationship to
        individual amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> could enable 
        d -tc to be used as a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>
        to determine relative positions of these amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        Lerisetron inhibition of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron binding to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was also investigated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lerisetron</ENAMEX> is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">potent 5-HT</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R antagonist first synthesized by
        Orales 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . As was observed for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R agonists, lerisetron binding was
        altered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y142A</TIMEX> mutation. This mutation produced an
        increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> fold compared to wildtype
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. This increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i indicates an important interaction of
        lerisetron with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y142</ENAMEX> and a similarity between the binding
        location of lerisetron, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lerisetron</ENAMEX> is the only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist</ENAMEX> tested that shares a binding site interaction in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> with agonists. In contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HT</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX>, however, lerisetron also
        interacts with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX> as indicated by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> fold increase
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y152A mutant receptors</ENAMEX>. Since
        neither 
        d -tc nor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron interacts
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y142</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX>, there appears to be a difference between
        the interactions formed by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lerisetron</ENAMEX>. The binding sites of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>
        tested differ with respect to this binding loop. Since the
        role of a competitive antagonist is simply to block the
        binding of agonists and prevent channel opening, the
        specific amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that interact with the ligand can vary
        for different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. This is less likely to be the
        case with agonists since they must produce a conformational
        change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to exert their effects.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant receptors</ENAMEX> failed to bind [
        3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G147A and V149A</TIMEX>. G147 is the conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycine</ENAMEX> in this putative binding loop. Chirara 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. al. have suggested that the
        highly conserved nature of the glycine in this region may
        indicate the existence of a loop structure consisting of
        either Î³ or a loose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>-turn in the nAChR [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        . Either of these turns would bring the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> putative
        Î²-strands together such that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Î³L109</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Î³Y111 and Î³S115</TIMEX> and
        Î³Y117 are all on the same side of an antiparallel Î²-sheet.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> have been identified by affinity labeling,
        site-directed mutagenesis or cysteine substitution to lie
        on the same surface. A classic <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-residue Î²</NUMEX>-turn would place
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on opposite surfaces [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Substitution
        of the conserved glycine by alanine may disrupt the
        structure of this region and prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> or expression
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. The recent determination of the crystal
        structure of an AChBP supports this hypothesis. The AChBP
        displays a large amount of homology to the amino terminal
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LGIC receptors</ENAMEX> and thus may be similar in structure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . The crystal structure of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> reveals a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">loose 3</ENAMEX> residue turn incorporating the conserved glycine
        residue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Homologous residues</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGIC</ENAMEX> subunits
        have also been identified and are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The
        residues identified in this study as altering binding
        affinity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands would also be present on the
        same surface if this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is present in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> While Y140 lies somewhat outside
        the region identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiara</ENAMEX> in the nAChR (homologous to
        Î³N107), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Î³L109 and Î³L119</TIMEX> are homologous to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> The ability of lerisetron to
        interact with both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX> also supports the
        hypothesis that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are present in a loop
        structure since the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intervening residues</ENAMEX> would
        position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX> too far apart to permit them both to
        interact with a single ligand even if they were interacting
        with functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on opposite ends of the molecule. A
        loop structure would bring them into closer proximity and
        permit interaction with the small molecule lerisetron.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> tyrosine mutations were investigated using a
        whole cell patch clamp assay to determine if functional
        changes could be observed. Whole cell responses could not
        be obtained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140A</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142A</TIMEX>, although specific binding
        of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> was observed. These data suggest that,
        while the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> do assemble and are capable of binding
        [ 3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>, they are either not transported to the
        cell surface or are non-responsive to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT at
        concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mM or less</NUMEX>.
        Y152A does produce functional channels however they
        display distinctly altered response kinetics when compared
        to wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Y152A responses do not show the
        rapid rise times observed in wt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The extremely
        slow rise times observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y152A receptors</ENAMEX> may indicate a
        change in rate constants preceding channel opening. These
        changes in the rate constants for either agonist binding or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> opening also produce a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> fold decrease in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observed EC</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT activation. The slow rise is
        followed by a non-desensitizing phase of the response that
        is dramatically different from the fast desensitization
        observed for wt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rs</ENAMEX>. Lack of desensitization could
        result from either a stabilization of the open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> or a destabilization of the desensitized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        Mutations of homologous or nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nAChR</ENAMEX> and GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have also been demonstrated
        to alter the agonist response. Mutation of the homologous
        residue in the GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor Î³-subunit</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T142</NUMEX>) to serine
        altered the efficacy of the agonist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flumazenil</ENAMEX>, converting
        it to a partial agonist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . In the nAChR, mutation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> ÎµP121 to leucine altered both the binding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetylcholine</ENAMEX> and the stability of the open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>. ÎµP121 is homologous to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">P154</NUMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R and is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only two residues</NUMEX> away from
        Y152. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of this study concluded that this portion
        of the acetylcholine binding site was closely linked to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> opening region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . It is
        reasonable to conclude that the homologous region in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R may perform a similar function. The
        link between an agonist binding domain and a conformational
        change leading to channel opening is not unexpected since
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> must obviously be linked. If binding to this region
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is shown to be a critical step between the
        binding of agonists and the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, further
        investigation of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in this loop may provide
        valuable clues to molecular basis of this process.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our data indicate an important role for this putative
        binding site loop in the interaction of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R with different ligands and
        illustrate the difference in binding of different
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of ligands. Each structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> shows
        different patterns of interaction with amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in this
        region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. [ 3H]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX> does not appear to
        interact with any of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> tested while 
        d -tc interacts with only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140</TIMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-HT with Y142</ENAMEX> and
        lerisetron with both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX>. Similar selective
        effects have been observed on other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> including
        W183, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F107</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E106</NUMEX> among others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 25 26</NUMEX> ] . Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in conjunction with those of other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>
        indicates the differences in orientation of different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> within the same binding cleft. These differences in
        orientation result in different amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>/functional group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. As the structural detail of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> emerges, these differences could potentially
        be exploited to produce more potent and specific ligands.
        For example construction of a "hybrid" ligand that combines
        the interactions of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron with those of 
        d -tc, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m CPBG</ENAMEX> could produce an antagonist
        with increased affinity due to the additional binding
        energy of these interactions and a greater specificity
        since it would utilize more structural features of the
        binding site.
        The requirement of a glycine at position 147 and the
        ability of lerisetron to interact with both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y142</ENAMEX> and Y152
        also support the hypothesis that the secondary structure in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is formed by a loop structure.

        present in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R, then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX> would be
        present on the same side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> would
        be capable of extending into the binding site. A similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> has been made for the nAChR where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î³S111</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Î³Y117</TIMEX>,
        Î³L119, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Î´R113 and Î´T119</TIMEX> of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nAChR receptor</ENAMEX> and
        Î³L109 and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î³Y111</NUMEX> of the torpedo nAChR are all thought to be
        present in the binding site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] .
