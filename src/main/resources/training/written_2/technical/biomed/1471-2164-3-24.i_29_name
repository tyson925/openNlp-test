        High-resolution genetic maps are essential to
        identifying and characterizing the gene(s) contributing to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, that is, they are essential for making the
        transition from positional cloning to the positional
        candidate approach. If the physical order of markers used
        for linkage analysis is incorrect, the position of the
        putative locus may at best be incorrect and at worst be
        found not to exist in the true interval. We were hampered
        in our efforts to fine map the gene for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome
        because we were faced with an uncertain marker order in
        maps that had many inconsistencies.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MIM 186580</NUMEX>), an autosomal dominant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">granulomatous disease</ENAMEX> of childhood, is a rare familial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">granulomatous disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        typically display one or more of the following
        granulomatous inflammations that have variable
        age-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-onset: acute anterior uveitis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, and skin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rash</ENAMEX>. The phenotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome resembles another
        multisystem granulomatous disorder, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> (MIM
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">266600</NUMEX>), and another autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, psoriasis (MIM
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">177900</NUMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> inflammatory diseases not only share
        phenotypic features, but a subset of putative risk loci
        mapped to an overlapping region on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>. Of the
        several putative susceptibility loci for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] and psoriasis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crohn</ENAMEX>'s locus on
        16q <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between markers D16S409 and D16S419</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65.6</NUMEX> cM from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p-terminus</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and the psoriasis locus on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16q</TIMEX> near
        D16S3110 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] overlap with the locus for the Blau
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, another autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>
        ankylosing spondylitis (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MIM 106300</NUMEX>), also maps to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 16q</ENAMEX>, however, it appears to map telomeric to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome interval [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        While our studies were in progress, other groups
        detected mutations in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CARD15</NUMEX> gene for a subset of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . The lack of accurate maps is reflected
        in the position assigned to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">CARD15</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive genome</TIMEX>
        builds in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CARD15</ENAMEX> should map to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16q13</NUMEX> interval for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crohn's</ENAMEX>, yet in build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> it was mapped close to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-telomere of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>. In the current build, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>,
        it is located correctly (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blau_map.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>). Until the draft human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is truly
        complete, detailed regional physical maps will be
        indispensable for genetic studies.

        We have previously reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome
        susceptibility region resided between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S298</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D16S408</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . Here we generated a high-resolution map extending
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from D16S3080</TIMEX>, near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S409</TIMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">D16S408</NUMEX> and placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>

        the map. We also excluded the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes as the
        genes harbouring mutations causing the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High-resolution</ENAMEX> RH map
          To generate a framework order of markers, we used
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> panels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and the RHMAP program package.
          We typed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneBridge 4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> markers to verify
          that they occurred near, or in, the interval between
          D16S409 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S408</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> was typed for a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> markers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">83 markers.</TIMEX> The
          markers were clustered into linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point
          analyses using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RH2PT</ENAMEX> and a criterion of a lod score
          greater than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Multipoint analyses were
          performed on linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as well as sparse linkage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> together with markers from other linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          Several multipoint maximum likelihood framework maps were
          constructed using the RHMAXLIK program of the RHMAP
          package and equal retention probabilities and the branch
          ordering scheme options, which gives the highest
          probability of finding the correct order [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The G3
          RH map (see additional data file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, blau_map.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>)
          provided an order for the construction of the BAC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contigs</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> generated a useful map,
          there were unresolved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where it appeared that the
          panel did not provide sufficient data to differentiate
          between alternative marker orders. We merged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G3</TIMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNG</ENAMEX> data by establishing a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3</NUMEX> framework map that fixed
          the order of a subset of markers. Clusters of close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> G3 mapped markers were
          then mapped relative to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-another using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNG</ENAMEX> data.
          By integrating the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3</NUMEX> and the TNG maps, an overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contiguous RH</ENAMEX> map of the region between the markers
          D16S411 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D16S415</ENAMEX> was constructed in which the marker
          order of most loci could be determined with a likelihood
          ratio of greater than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">300:1</TIMEX> over the next most likely
          order (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig construction
          We carefully selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STSs</ENAMEX> from within or around the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> interval to screen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. More
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STSs</ENAMEX> were chosen from those in known genes,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>, polymorphic microsatellite markers, random genomic
          sequences, and BAC end sequences present in databases.
          Construction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone contig was initiated by
          screening the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> markers. The
          clone contigs were constructed based on the common BACs
          identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more markers, using the RH map
          described above and the existing framework map resources
          as reference for ordering.
          We initially identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">377</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX> clones with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> hits from which a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> clones
          that contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> markers was used to construct
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> contig clusters (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blau_map.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> non-redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX> clones in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contigs</ENAMEX> covered <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> of the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome
          interval. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX> clones were redundant in
          that they either were identified by a single marker or
          were identified by the same markers as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-redundant</ENAMEX> clones. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaps</ENAMEX> in the contigs were closed by
          a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BESs</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTGS</ENAMEX> data, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clone</ENAMEX> walking using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> from end clones
          to hybridize to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPCI-11 gridded</ENAMEX> filters, and
          verification of clone positions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STSs</ENAMEX>. From the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contigs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> clones from both ends of the contig
          clusters were selected for sequencing using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7</ENAMEX> and SP6
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX>. Sequence alignments with these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 end</TIMEX> sequences
          revealed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">_361N2-T7</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">_520M7-SP6</ENAMEX>, identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> common clone from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">online HTGS</ENAMEX>, which was RPCI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>_147B17 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BES</ENAMEX> alignment was a very feasible and practical
          technique for filling in the gaps with the availability
          of an ever-increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone sequences in
          online databases. Using this approach, one gap between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S2986 and Cda11d08</TIMEX> was closed. STS marker
          D16S2986 was initially used to search the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTGS</ENAMEX> data and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPCI-11_357N13</ENAMEX> was retrieved with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          identity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BES</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clone 357N13</TIMEX> was then used to repeat
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignment</ENAMEX> searches and identified another clone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPCI-11</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">488J11</ENAMEX>, which overlapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">STS markers Cda11d08</ENAMEX> and
          WI-16741.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> rounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clone</ENAMEX> walking were carried out in order
          to either close the gaps or verify the order of the clone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contigs</ENAMEX>. All the plasmid DNAs from these clones were
          isolated and completely digested by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hind III</ENAMEX> into linear fragments for
          run-off transcription. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> were directly
          transcribed from human genomic sequence, it was necessary
          to test the probes for repetitive sequences. The presence
          of repetitive sequences can hinder the specific
          identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> filters. Of
          44 probes tested, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> probes produced multiple bands
          with the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> indicating that they contained
          repetitive sequences, and were, therefore, excluded from
          further analyses. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 400</NUMEX> clones from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPCI-11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> were incorporated (see
          additional data file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, blau_map.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>). After one round of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clone</ENAMEX> walking, the physical map covered <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80%</NUMEX> of
          the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome interval. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round
          increased coverage to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> unresolved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gaps</ENAMEX> remain in the physical map (see additional data file
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, blau_map.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig to other maps
          We compared our map to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the current, July 1, 2002</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contigs</ENAMEX> generated by fingerprinting and available from
          the FPC database at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington University</ENAMEX> Genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing Center</ENAMEX>. The FPC database has few clones from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and none that corresponded to the clones
          on our map (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blau_map.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>).
          Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPCI-11</ENAMEX> clones in our contigs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> were present

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to gap 1 (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>

          suggest it should be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ctg16020</TIMEX> close to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">122K22</NUMEX> and
          444I18. Our data also reversed the order of clones
          380E14, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">210K18 and 535L14</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ctg16020</TIMEX>. Aside from one
          minor difference with respect to clone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">444I18</ENAMEX> that our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> place slightly closer to the q telomere, the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> clones of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contig ctg16021</ENAMEX> that were common
          to both maps agreed very well. There was a single clone
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ctg16024</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">463J22</TIMEX> that our data place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ctg16021</TIMEX>, near
          228I15. Interestingly, one of the clones, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">327F22</TIMEX>, that
          was placed on a contig from a different chromosome was
          the clone that contains all or part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CARD15</TIMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> build current at the time our map was being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">finalized</ENAMEX> was build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blau_map.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>). There were a large number of discrepancies
          between our map and the build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> map. The gene
          subsequently characterized as having mutations in Blau
          syndrome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was not in the interval. The
          discrepancies largely remained until builds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 and 29</NUMEX>.
          Build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>, the current build, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> agrees very well
          with our map (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blau_map.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Candidate genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CES1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP15 and SCYA17</TIMEX>, with
          relevant biochemical functions based on the literature
          and with map locations in the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> susceptibility
          region as defined by our initial DNA linkage study for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , were considered as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
          CES1 is expressed in mature monocytes and macrophages,
          and is involved in the degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">xenobiotics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          . MMP2 or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP15</TIMEX>, or both, are connective tissue degrading
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . A hypothetical role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP2</TIMEX> and MMP15
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome is that aberrant expression of MMP2
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP15</ENAMEX> could inappropriately degrade connective
          tissue, which, in turn, could release stored cytokines
          and inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, such as tumor necrosis factor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> and interleukins and potentially expose neo-epitopes.
          SCYA17 is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of chemokines that is
          involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . It is a chemoattractant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes
          and is expressed constitutively in thymus and transiently
          in stimulated peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          Interestingly, high levels of expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SCYA17</TIMEX> were
          observed in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytes
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sekiya et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] showed that SCYA17
          potentially played a role via a paracrine mechanism in
          the development of allergic respiratory diseases. Thus,
          inappropriate topical expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SCYA17</ENAMEX> could induce a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">localized immune</ENAMEX> or auto-immune response.
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> sequence variants were identified in the
          promoter region of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CES1</NUMEX> gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) by sequencing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Blau</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> thirteen-marker
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> could be assigned unambiguously (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>)
          using extended pedigree structures (data not shown),
          however, none of them was associated with the Blau
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome phenotype</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CES1</NUMEX> gene was, therefore,
          excluded as a candidate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome.
          RH mapping of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CES1 and MMP2</TIMEX> placed them close, and
          centromeric, to D16S408 (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blau_map.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>), whereas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP15 and SCYA17</TIMEX> mapped telomeric
          to D16S408. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MMP15</NUMEX> locus was placed between D16S408
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D16S494</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneBridge</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>. CES1 and
          MMP2 were mapped to clones in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contigs (see
          additional data file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, blau_map.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SCYA17</ENAMEX> and
          the markers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cda1jb12 and R55777</TIMEX> were mapped to the BAC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">_387I12</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">437K19</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">229H3</ENAMEX>, which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">map 1.1 Mbp</ENAMEX> telomeric to D16S408 according to the NCBI
          human genomic data (data not shown). Our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> distance
          estimates also place these markers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1</NUMEX> Mbp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeric</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S408</TIMEX>. In our G3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> map CES1 was located
          outside a subsequently refined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome interval
          that excluded several cM centromeric to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S408</TIMEX>, thus
          confirming the lack of association between CES1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> and the disease phenotype.
          Mutations were characterized in the gene CARD15 for a
          few small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . We
          have characterized additional mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, however, only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> had
          mutations in the exons and flanking sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X. Wang</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H. Kuivaniemi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Bonavita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Mutkus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. Mau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Blau</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Inohara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Nunez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Tromp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.J. Williams</ENAMEX>; in
          press). The gene was located in the approximate interval
          both cytologically and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> map
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway</ENAMEX>?<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">db</ENAMEX>=<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hg10</TIMEX>, but was
          located on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16p</NUMEX> on the NCBI map (builds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>). We verified the location of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CARD15</TIMEX> on our map by
          amplifying a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">444</NUMEX> bp fragment of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 from clone</NUMEX> 327F22
          in our map (see additional data file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blau_map.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Correct marker order and intermarker distance are
        essential for linkage analysis and therefore require
        construction of accurate physical and genetic maps. Here we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employed BAC</ENAMEX> contig and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> mapping to construct a
        high-resolution physical map, which spans <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 7.5</NUMEX>
        Mbp of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between markers D16S3080 and D16S408</TIMEX>.
        This map will definitely assist in the refinement of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Blau syndrome</ENAMEX> locus as well as other loci mapping to this
        region, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , psoriasis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and
        possibly ankylosing spondylitis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        We constructed a high-resolution RH map (likelihood
        ratio of greater than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">300:1</TIMEX> over the next likely order)
        with the medium-resolution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G3</TIMEX> and high-resolution TNG
        whole-genome RH panels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This map allowed
        ordering of the polymorphic markers and estimation of the
        distances between them. The marker order provided the basis
        for construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig. The intermarker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX> estimated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> data were substantiated by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig data when the average length of the BAC inserts
        was used to estimate intermarker distances. Our BAC contig
        provides <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> coverage of the entire Blau
        susceptibility region. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">STS</ENAMEX>-based high-resolution
        physical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">contig</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>, and spans
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 7.5 Mb as estimated</NUMEX> from the number of BACs
        in the shortest tiling path and the average insert length
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX>. We have used our map to refine the Blau
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome interval</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X. Wang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Kuivaniemi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Bonavita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>
        Mutkus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. Mau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Blau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Inohara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Nunez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Tromp</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.J. Williams</ENAMEX>; in press).
        Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> contig map of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16q</NUMEX> constructed by
        two-dimensional overlapping oligonucleotide (overgo)
        hybridization on high-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAC</ENAMEX> filters has been
        published [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This map consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">828</NUMEX> overgo markers
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,363</NUMEX> BACs providing > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> coverage of the long arm
        of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>. This contig map, however, does not cover
        the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>; it ends at the site of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker D16S2758</ENAMEX> in our physical contig (see additional data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">file 1</ENAMEX>). The order for most of the markers is the same on
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independently generated maps. Nevertheless, there
        are a few differences. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        mapped the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker D16S2950</ENAMEX> in the order of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S2623</TIMEX>,
        D16S2950 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D16S744</ENAMEX>, with the markers equidistant at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130</TIMEX> kbp. We found the order to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S2623</TIMEX>,
        D16S744 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D16S2950</ENAMEX> with interval of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 130</NUMEX> kbp
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> kbp, respectively. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Han et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] map
        has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> regions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blau</ENAMEX> susceptibility interval which
        are either spanned with tenuous support or none at all. Two
        are real gaps with no overlapping clones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</NUMEX>
        are spanned by few clones that have either unusually long
        inserts or are missing some of the markers in the interval,
        or both.
        Our contig also contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gaps that we were unable
        to close by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> walking. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them corresponds to one
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> gaps in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Han et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] map. The other two
        are located in the region between markers <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D16S2758</ENAMEX> and
        D16S408, which is not covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The
        common gap in both physical contigs indicates either a lack
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> markers in this region or an under-representation of
        clones even though <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were used in our study, or
        both. We estimate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> data that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gaps</ENAMEX> are only
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">425, 530</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">375</NUMEX> kbp in size and will not substantially
        affect DNA linkage analyses. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> gap (see additional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), is also present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPC</ENAMEX> contigs, between
        ctg16020 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ctg16021</ENAMEX>, whereas the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> have been
        filled in.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We generated a high-resolution physical map from
        D16S3080, near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S409</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S408</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16q12.1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16q13</NUMEX>)
        because the correct marker order was required for further
        linkage studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. A physical map
        was also necessary to locate, or verify the location of,
        candidate genes. Although there were substantial
        discrepancies as to the location of markers and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at
        the time we initiated our mapping project, and even when
        this physical map was assembled into a final draft, the
        current NCBI map based on build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPC</ENAMEX> contigs, and
        the map produced here, agree remarkably well. The
        convergence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independently constructed maps based
        on different approaches, suggests that the current maps are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliable</ENAMEX>, will perhaps undergo minor changes, and will be
        useful for mapping of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> loci to the interval.

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehead Institute GeneBridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanford</ENAMEX> G3
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNG</ENAMEX> whole genome RH panels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX>) were
          used to construct a RH map. Before typing the hybrid
          panels, the PCR conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> markers were
          determined using hamster and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> as control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">templates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were separated on agarose gels.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of appropriate size were considered
          positive and scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 1</NUMEX>, negative PCRs as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ambiguous PCRs</ENAMEX> with bands of unexpected size as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GeneBridge 4</ENAMEX> RH map was constructed using a publicly
          available server at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehead Institute</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3</NUMEX> and TNG
          maps were generated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RHMAP 3.0</ENAMEX> program package [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RH2PT</ENAMEX> program was used initially to determine
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point lod scores and all the markers were divided
          into different linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markers</ENAMEX> in different
          linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were used to carry out maximum likelihood
          calculations to estimate breakage probabilities and
          distances between markers using another program RHMAXLIK.
          We established a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3</NUMEX> framework map of a subset of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> evenly spaced markers. Additional markers
          were mapped in overlapping sets with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> data until
          the likelihood ratio dropped below threshold. Clusters of
          closely spaced markers around framework markers were then
          mapped using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNG</ENAMEX> data and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHMAXLIK</ENAMEX>. Map orders were
          verified by performing independent estimations of
          likelihood but including markers from adjacent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CITB</ENAMEX>, which was generated at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> in the form of DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pools</ENAMEX> arranged in microtiter plates, was purchased
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> offers approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-fold coverage of the whole genome with an average
          insert size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> kbp. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is comprised of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147,456</NUMEX> distinct recombinants. For rapid screening, DNAs
          from the clones had been pooled into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> superpools, each
          representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight 384</NUMEX>-well plates that were pooled into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> plate pools, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 row</TIMEX> pools, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> column pools.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based screening consisted of identifying positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superpools</ENAMEX> followed by screening of the appropriate
          plate, row and column pools. Typically, the
          three-dimensional screening identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> unique
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,072</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones in a superpool.
          Occasionally, multiple positives in a single plate
          (plate, row, column) resulted in non-unique positives
          (these also generated false-positives). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRs</ENAMEX> were
          performed as described above except that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼l</NUMEX> of pooled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> DNA was used as template and the annealing
          temperature for most markers was raised to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60Â°C</NUMEX> to
          achieve greater specificity.
          High-density filters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Roswell Park Cancer</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute human RPCI-11 BAC</ENAMEX> clones were purchased from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACPAC Resource Center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital Oakland</ENAMEX>
          Research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CA. Segments 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPCI-11</ENAMEX>, with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">218,995</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> corresponding
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately twelve</NUMEX>-fold genomic coverage, were used.
          The filters were screened iteratively by hybridization
          with pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> prepared from the ends of BAC
          clones identified either by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>-screening or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior</TIMEX> rounds
          of hybridization. Hybridizations were performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ULTRAhyb</ENAMEX> buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>) and components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX>-EZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>).
          Prior to pooling, the probes were tested individually
          for the presence of repetitive elements by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and complete 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hin d III</ENAMEX> digests of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
          Probes that demonstrated a pattern consistent with the
          presence of repetitive elements were excluded.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>-inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE)
          To determine the size of important BAC inserts, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAC DNA</ENAMEX> was first digested with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> units of 
          Not I (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>). DNA
          fragments were then separated on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> pulsed field
          certified agarose gel (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Ã— GTBE buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ã— TBE</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> glycine) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIGE</ENAMEX> with a PC <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">750 Pulse</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Controller</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoefer Scientific Instruments</ENAMEX>). The samples
          were prerun at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12Â°C</TIMEX> and 8 V/cm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX>, and then run
          continuously for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> h with forward pulse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> s, reverse
          pulse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> s and timing ramp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0.8/h</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Low-Range PFG Marker</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">194</NUMEX> kbp) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>) was used for
          estimation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> insert sizes. After electrophoresis,
          the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, visualized,
          and photographed with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GelPrint2000i</NUMEX> system
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioPhotonics</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Verification of positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones
          Screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones, either by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> of pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
          or by hybridisation, produced a wide range of signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>. Although differences in signal intensity may
          be considered as a measure of the evidence for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>' positions in the contig, the variability of input
          target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> made the conclusions unreliable. Positive
          clones were therefore rescreened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> markers
          in the vicinity to eliminate false positive.
          Positive clones were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>-blot filters were prepared using a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Biomek 1000</TIMEX>
          Automated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Laboratory Workstation</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-pin replicator
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman Coulter</ENAMEX>). The gridded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>-blots were screened
          with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> from the pools above. All
          positive clones were confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> with appropriate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> pairs.
        
        
          Preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> from the ends of BAC
          clones
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BAC DNAs</ENAMEX> from standard alkaline lysis preparations [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] were completely digested with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hin d III</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA probes</ENAMEX> were
          synthesized from the ends of clones by run-off
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX>-EZ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambion</ENAMEX>) and
          32P-UTP (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN Radiochemicals</ENAMEX>). Unincorporated nucleotides
          were removed by size-exclusion chromatography on
          RNase-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadex G-50</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) spin columns.
        
        
          Candidate genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, namely, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CES1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP15</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SCYA17</ENAMEX>,
          were selected based on their biochemical function and
          physical map locations prior to completion of our
          high-resolution map. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genes
          were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> (accession numbers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CES1</TIMEX>:
          D21077; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP2</TIMEX>: U96098; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP15</TIMEX>: Z48482; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SCYA17: AC004382</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primers</ENAMEX> to be used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for each gene were designed
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Package Version 10.0</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Group</ENAMEX>) and synthesized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operon Technologies</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc. PCR</ENAMEX> conditions other than annealing temperature used
          were the same as described above.
          The physical locations of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> studied were
          verified by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> as described below. Their
          locations were further refined by screening a BAC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, as discussed below, using gene-specific PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX>. MMP15 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SCYA17</ENAMEX> were located telomeric to
          D16S408 and thus outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome interval and
          were excluded from further studies. MMP2 was placed
          outside of a refined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome interval that excluded
          several cM centromeric from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D16S408</TIMEX>.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">755</NUMEX> bp region, nucleotide position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-660</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+95</NUMEX>, of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CES1</NUMEX> gene was amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Blau</ENAMEX> syndrome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENECLEAN III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIO 101 Inc.</ENAMEX>) to remove primers
          and other reagents, and sequenced (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermo Sequenase Â®</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Life Science, Inc.</ENAMEX>). Haplotypes were derived
          from the inheritance of the variants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> not shown). Sequencing products were separated
          on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> glycerol-tolerant polyacrylamide sequencing gels
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Diagnostics</ENAMEX>).
          To verify that the gene for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CARD15</TIMEX> is located in the
          contig, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">444 bp</NUMEX> genomic region, corresponding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">976 to 1227 of the CARD15</TIMEX> transcript
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">022162.1</NUMEX>) was amplified from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clones. Clone 327F22
          yielded a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of appropriate size.
