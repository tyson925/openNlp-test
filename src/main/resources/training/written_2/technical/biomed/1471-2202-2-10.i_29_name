        In golden hamsters, microinjections of arginine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasopressin</ENAMEX> (AVP) into the anterior hypothalamus trigger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grooming</ENAMEX> and flank marking, a stereotyped scent marking
        behavior [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</TIMEX> after AVP
        microinjections, hamsters start to lick and comb sebaceous
        glands situated on their dorsolateral flanks. Bouts of
        flank gland grooming may be so intense that the flanks are
        left matted and soaked in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flank</ENAMEX> marking behavior is
        observed soon after the onset of grooming, and usually
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX> of the microinjection. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flank</ENAMEX> marking is
        a scent marking behavior involved in olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and is characterized by arching the
        back and rubbing the flank glands vigorously against
        objects in the environment. The concentrations of AVP
        required to induce flank marking are low (ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] and the volumes microinjected in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> hypothalamus are small (ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 100</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nl</ENAMEX>). The activation of flank marking is dose-dependent, and
        specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX>, as microinjections of other neuropeptides,
        excitatory amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, and catecholamines do not elicit
        the behavior [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 6</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flank</ENAMEX> marking is also specific to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AVP V1 receptors</ENAMEX>, as the behavior is selectively inhibited
        by V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> and activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">V1 receptor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        The behavioral effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> are not limited to flank
        marking in hamsters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasopressin</ENAMEX> is a neurotransmitter
        released centrally to affect various behaviors, e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arousal</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , temperature regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] , aggression
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , memory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and grooming [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . However,
        the ability of centrally acting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> to induce intense
        stereotyped behaviors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 14</ENAMEX> ] raises the possibility that
        this neuropeptide may be associated with the induction of
        compulsive behaviors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Indeed, alterations in AVP
        regulation and secretion are thought to be one possible
        biochemical abnormality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with Obsessive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Compulsive Disorder</ENAMEX> (OCD) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . This disorder
        is characterized by sudden, recurrent thoughts or images
        that intrude into consciousness (obsessions) driving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stereotyped</ENAMEX> acts that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> feels compelled to perform
        (compulsions) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with OCD
        show elevated basal levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> in the cerebrospinal
        fluid and exaggerated plasma levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> in response to
        hypertonic challenge [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with anorexia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nervosa</ENAMEX> and bulimia nervosa, both compulsive eating
        disorders, have abnormal levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> in the cerebrospinal
        fluid and plasma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 17</NUMEX> ] . Pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> have low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> in cerebrospinal fluid, while a
        subgroup of pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with compulsive checking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rituals</ENAMEX> has elevated AVP levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Hence, there are
        many clinical examples of compulsive behavior associated
        with a perturbation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> system.
        Given the association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> and the
        stereotyped nature of AVP-induced flank gland grooming and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking, the present studies were undertaken to
        determine whether clomipramine and fluoxetine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
        used to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">OCD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] might inhibit these
        AVP-induced behaviors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clomipramine</ENAMEX> is a non-selective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-uptake inhibitor of serotonin, and to some extent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norepinephrine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and fluoxetine is a selective
        serotonin re-uptake inhibitor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Both of these drugs
        have proven to be effective in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> models of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . As an additional control, hamsters were also
        treated with desipramine, a noradrenergic re-uptake
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] that has been found ineffective in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibiting OCD</ENAMEX> in preclinical [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and clinical studies [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        Microinjection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> AVP caused robust grooming and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> groomed for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 50%</NUMEX> of
        the duration of the tests. The comparisons between groups
        showed some effects of treatment on flank marking activity
        (F 
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,25</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> treated with clomipramine or fluoxetine flank
        marked significantly less than vehicle-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (p
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> treated with desipramine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flank</ENAMEX> marked
        as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.1</NUMEX>), but flank
        marked more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated with clomipramine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). However, the comparisons failed to show any effect
        of treatment on grooming activity (F 
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,25</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.61</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Indeed, regardless of treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> spent a
        similar amount of time grooming after microinjection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX>.
        Clomipramine caused a significant (F 
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,15</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>)
        dose-dependent reduction in flank marking induced by
        microinjection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 Î¼M</NUMEX> AVP (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>). Flank gland grooming
        was unaffected by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> treatments (F 
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,15</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.009</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>)
      
      
        Discussion
        In the present experiments, AVP-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grooming</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking behaviors were tested in hamsters exposed to
        chronic treatment with psychotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preclinical</ENAMEX> and clinical studies to be effective in the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 28</NUMEX> ] . The results show differential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to these treatments. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grooming</ENAMEX> remained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unaffected</ENAMEX>, flank marking was inhibited by treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluoxetine</ENAMEX> and clomipramine but not desipramine.
        Clomipramine showed a dose-dependent decrease in flank
        marking. These observations lead to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main conclusions.
        The first conclusion is related to the neurochemical
        properties of fluoxetine and clomipramine. As noted
        earlier, fluoxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> while clomipramine is a non-selective re-uptake
        inhibitor of serotonin, and to some extent norepinephrine.
        The effectiveness of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> presupposes a serotonin
        mechanism is involved in the suppression of AVP-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> conclusion is related to
        observations on grooming. While bouts of grooming are
        coincident with flank marking, the selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking and not grooming by clomipramine and
        fluoxetine suggest the two behaviors employ different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuronal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and neurochemical signals for their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Although earlier studies have implicated grooming
        behavior as a phenomenological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correspondent</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 29</NUMEX>
        ] inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> like clomipramine or fluoxetine, the
        situation appears different for AVP-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grooming</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hamsters</ENAMEX>. In canine acral lick dermatitis, the excessive
        licking of the paws and flanks was significantly reduced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluoxetine</ENAMEX> and clomipramine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> into
        treatment, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . However, the scale of the
        reduction was more pronounced over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-week</TIMEX> period of
        treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Perhaps flank gland grooming would have
        been significantly altered in these studies if drug
        treatment had been extended for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several more weeks</TIMEX>.
        The present data show that AVP-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flank</ENAMEX> marking is
        selectively inhibited by chronic treatment with serotonin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-uptake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> such as fluoxetine or clomipramine,
        instead of noradrenergic re-uptake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desipramine</ENAMEX>. Similar patterns of results have been observed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OCD</ENAMEX> such as canine acral lick [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        These observations are not limited to animal models.
        Selective serotonin re-uptake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are recognized as
        an effective biological treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In a
        double blind, placebo control study, treating over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX>, clomipramine was found to be superior to
        placebo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Differences between clomipramine and
        placebo were noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as one week</TIMEX> after the start of
        treatment, with significant clinical improvement occurring
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> of treatment.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluoxetine</ENAMEX> also results in a significant reduction in
        OCD severity that takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX> to realize [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ]
        . This therapeutic delay has been related to a
        down-regulation of serotonin autoreceptors with chronic
        exposure to elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">serotonin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . Together, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> have been used to link OCD with a dysfunction in
        serotonin neurotransmission [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Of course, it is
        unclear whether prolonged treatment with these re-uptake
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> is restricted to serotonin alone or impact on
        the activity of other neurotransmitter systems. For
        example, chronic treatment with fluoxetine decreases the
        release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat hypothalamic</ENAMEX> organ cultures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
        . This finding is particularly noteworthy since alterations
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> levels in the cerebrospinal fluid have been
        correlated with occurrences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . The
        occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> has also been correlated with increased
        levels of oxytocin, a neuropeptide closely related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . In golden hamsters, the elevation of serotonin in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior hypothalamus</ENAMEX> following fluoxetine treatment
        can inhibit the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> related to
        aggressive behavior [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The ability of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microinjected AVP</ENAMEX> in the anterior hypothalamus to enhance
        aggressive behavior in golden hamsters is blocked by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fluoxetine</ENAMEX> treatment and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serotonin</ENAMEX> 5HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1A receptor agonists</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The
        present data include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX>-stimulated flank marking in the
        list of behaviors suppressed by fluoxetine treatment.
      
      
        Conclusion
        These results show AVP-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flank</ENAMEX> marking is
        inhibited by chronic treatment with fluoxetine or
        clomipramine, but not desipramine. This pattern of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to drug treatment suggests that AVP-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking may be used as a model for screening
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">psychotropics</ENAMEX> used in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX>. It is a
        cost-efficient, ethical alternative to existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and
        can be useful in further advancing our understanding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX>. Future studies could focus on effects of long-term
        elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hamsters</TIMEX>; dose-response manipulations
        of psychotropics or clinical use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AVP</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to further investigate the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> and Treatment
          Experiments were performed on adult male golden
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hamsters</ENAMEX> ( 
          Mesocricetus auratus ) weighing
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">160</TIMEX> g. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> underwent stereotaxic
          surgery, and were allowed to recover before behavioral
          testing. The hamsters were kept on a reverse light cycle
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14L: 10D</TIMEX>, lights on at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">19:00</TIMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plexiglas</ENAMEX> cages, and
          received food and water 
          ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX>. All behavioral tests
          were performed during the dark phase of the circadian
          cycle under dim red illumination. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          acquired and cared for in accordance with the guidelines
          published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Guide for the Care</ENAMEX> and Use of
          Laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>:
          vehicle control (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veh</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> Tris-buffer saline, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> dimethyl sulfoxide; n=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), clomipramine hydrochloride
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clom</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>; n=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), desipramine hydrochloride (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          mg/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>; n=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) or fluoxetine hydrochloride (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluox</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          mg/day, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subcutaneous</ENAMEX> injections
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two consecutive weeks</TIMEX>. The doses and
          treatment regimen for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> were comparable to those
          used in several preclinical studies examining the
          pharmacological control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 38 39</NUMEX> ] . Acute drug
          trials were not attempted as the experimental design
          followed that of previously published studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 38 39</NUMEX>
          ] . After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 weeks</TIMEX> of treatment, hamsters were tested for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking after a microinjection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nl</ENAMEX> saline). This dose results in a maximal activation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Vasopressin was microinjected into
          the anterior hypothalamus of the hamsters with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> syringe connected through PE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> tubing to a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>-ga needle which was inserted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide cannula</ENAMEX> and
          lowered to the target site. Vasopressin-triggered flank
          marking occurs with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 sec</NUMEX> of microinjection and lasts
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ca.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-5 min</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . A trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> recorded the
          number of flank marks and the amount of time spent
          grooming for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> period. All behaviors were
          videotaped for further verification. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flank</ENAMEX> marking tests
          were run <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ca. 60-90 min</TIMEX> after subcutaneous drug
          treatments. The results were compared between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVAs</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher PLSD</ENAMEX> post-hoc tests.
          Although the effects of fluoxetine and clomipramine on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">flank</ENAMEX> marking were statistically significant in the drug
          comparison studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1</ENAMEX>), the effects were limited to a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-40%</NUMEX> reduction. As noted, the microinjection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">maximal</ENAMEX> flank marking, hence it is likely the
          inhibition of behavior with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> treatment might have
          been more pronounced if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were challenged with
          lower doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX>. To this end, dose-response data for
          clomipramine were generated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> microinjected with
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> each were treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg or 0.03 mg/kg</NUMEX> of clomipramine
          each day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two consecutive weeks</TIMEX>. Since the initial
          drug trials were effective with fluoxetine and
          clomipramine given in a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dose-response</ENAMEX> study worked in a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> times
          less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clomipramine</ENAMEX> used in the initial trial. On the day
          of testing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were treated with clomipramine and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60-90 min</TIMEX> later microinjected with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVP</ENAMEX> in a volume
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nl</ENAMEX> and scored for flank marking and flank gland
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grooming</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stereotaxic Surgery/Histology</ENAMEX>
          Stereotaxic surgery was performed under pentobarbital
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nembutal</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbott Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Chicago</ENAMEX>,
          I<) anaesthesia. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stereotaxic</ENAMEX> coordinates were: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>
          mm anterior to the bregma, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> to the
          midsagittal suture at an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8Â°</NUMEX> angle from the vertical line,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.5 mm</NUMEX> below the dura. A unilateral <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>-gauge guide
          cannula was lowered to the site and secured to the skull
          with dental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> cannula was closed with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33-ga</NUMEX> obturator extending <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>. The
          inner-cannula used for microinjections extended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> mm
          beyond the guide to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anterior hypothalamus</ENAMEX>. At
          the end of the study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed by
          decapitation, and their brains were taken out and fixed
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> formalin. Later, the brains were sliced on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vibratome</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were stained with thionin to
          confirm the location of the microinjection sites in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> hypothalamus.
