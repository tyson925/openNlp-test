        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circadian</ENAMEX> clocks located within metazoan brains have
        been a focus of investigation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Such clocks are compelling in part because they influence
        timing across many levels of analysis; they are driven by
        molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> whose concerted output, in the form of
        neuronal signaling, controls physiology and behavior [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        . Recently, the presence of circadian clocks in peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> has been established in the fruitfly as well as in
        lower vertebrates and mammals [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . For example, in
        
        Drosophila such clock functions have
        been demonstrated in antennae, wings, legs, a neuro-humoral
        gland, and internal excretory structures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . But
        it is unknown whether time-keeping mechanisms are identical
        wherever clocks are found within an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. While it
        appears that the same molecules previously identified as
        clock components in the brain give rise to clock function
        in the periphery, it is not yet known whether clock genes
        and their encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> act and interact in the same
        manner wherever they are expressed. Similarly, although
        circadian pacemaker cells in the 
        Drosophila brain have been
        characterized anatomically as discrete clusters of cells
        called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lateral Neurons</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , the identity of
        clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the tissues we studied is unknown. The same
        can be said about the function of these clocks: while
        circadian clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the brain control behavioral
        rhythms, the biological functions of clocks in peripheral
        tissues are minimally understood, except perhaps in the
        case of the antenna [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Analysis of genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circadian</ENAMEX> clocks in whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or isolated tissues is
        facilitated by the use of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, such as
        firefly 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luciferase</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luc</ENAMEX> ). The use of firefly- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luciferase</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luc</ENAMEX> ) as a real-time molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> of gene expression has been illustrated in a
        variety of model systems including cyanobacteria, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, 
        Drosophila , and mammals [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . This method has proved especially valuable in
        studies about molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythms</ENAMEX> because real-time
        expression of clock genes and other chronobiological
        factors may be monitored over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many daily</TIMEX> cycles 
        in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 6 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Applications of this technique are varied. For example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> have been employed to
        identify previously unappreciated genes that are involved
        in circadian timing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] as well as to demonstrate the
        presence of circadian clocks in isolated 
        Drosophila tissues.
        We previously employed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luc</ENAMEX> reporting to study the effects of
        a 
        cryptochrome mutation ( 
        cry 
        b ), concentrating on clock gene
        expression in isolated antennal pairs from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Earlier studies
        established that 
        cry encodes a 'deep-brain' element of
        the photoreceptive pathway to the circadian clock [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] . But our study suggested a different role for 
        cry in the periphery, because
        antennal rhythmicity in mutant specimens was dramatically
        reduced in constant darkness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , an effect that is not
        consistent with the idea that the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRY</ENAMEX>)
        functions solely as a photoreceptor for the circadian
        system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        While carrying out those studies, we became aware that
        there are interesting features of these peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rhythms</ENAMEX>,
        like the phase of peak expression, for example, that we
        were unable to compare rigorously amongst body parts. Such
        concerns motivated us to develop a set of tools for the
        analysis of circadian rhythms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Here we apply two
        key features of this analytic package that were unavailable
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our earlier</TIMEX> report on the effects of 
        cry 
        b in the periphery [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> is
        a method to eliminate nonlinear trends in the data, a
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> of artifact that could affect whether 
        luciferase activity is scored as
        rhythmic or arrhythmic. Figure 1illustrates how rhythmicity
        generated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antennal pair</ENAMEX> is extracted from rather
        weak output by the application of appropriate analytic
        tools. In addition, the normalization procedure facilitates
        comparisons between rhythms from different tissues by
        reducing the scale of the output to a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for each
        case (see Results). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we were not previously able to
        examine effects of a given variable (genotype, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> part)
        on circadian phase. The application of circular statistics
        to these data allows us to evaluate such effects.
        Our earlier conclusions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] have been substantially
        buttressed by the new features of these time-series
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>: With respect to its effects on clock-gene
        cyclings, the 
        cry 
        b mutation significantly reduces the
        number of rhythmic antennal pairs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forelegs</ENAMEX> (but not wings) compared with 
        cry +controls. Moreover, we have
        intensified the analysis of the rhythmic specimens and thus
        observed that parameters of rhythmicity are altered in the
        subset of rhythmic mutant specimens. Among the new findings
        that have emerged from the current analyses, the most
        salient are that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) 
        cry 
        b has a significant effect on the
        phase of clock gene expression in rhythmic peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) in isolated 
        cry +tissues, the relationship
        between the peak phase time of 
        luc -reported expression from 
        per and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (respectively) varies such
        that the peaks are indistinguishable in antennae and they
        differ significantly in wings or forelegs, for example. The
        findings reported here strengthen the hypothesis that clock
        mechanisms in the periphery differ from each other as well
        as from those operating in the central nervous system of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Effects of cry b on rhythms in isolated clock
          tissues under light-dark cycles
          We evaluated these various isolated tissues under a
          series of successive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-hr</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">light12</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hr</NUMEX>-dark cycles (LD
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:12</TIMEX>). These environmental conditions are the least
          likely to reveal deficits in the pattern of clock gene
          expression because the light-dark cycle provides a
          dominant stimulus to the clock (clock time is normally
          synchronized to this environmental cue) and is thought to
          increase the amplitude of clock gene cycling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 28 29</NUMEX> ]
          . Rhythmicity was assessed for each specimen by
          autocorrelation analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 27</NUMEX> ] . This analysis
          provides a quantitative estimate of rhythmicity with
          statistical confidence; whereas the confidence interval
          is based solely on the number of data points used in the
          analysis without relying on the variability in the data
          set or any other feature of the measured values, the
          criterion for statistical confidence is the same for all
          individual or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> analyses within an experiment (see [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] for more detail). In addition, the autocorrelation
          read-outs may be used in a less stringent (and more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subjective</ENAMEX>) manner to evaluate rhythmicity, based on the
          shape of a given plot - even when statistical
          significance is not achieved (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] for discussion
          of this feature of applying autocorrelation). This
          qualitative criterion is conservative from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>: If we imagine that 
          cry 
          b 's effect might be an elimination
          of 
          per-luc and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim-luc cyclings</ENAMEX> (given the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX>'s isolation phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ), elementary
          scrutiny of correlogram plots increases the chance that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from a given specimen could be judged rhythmic,
          thereby decreasing the likelihood that we would go
          overboard in evaluating mutationally induced damage to
          the clock system. Figure 2provides an example of why we
          use a system of qualitative criteria to assess
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythmicity</ENAMEX>; while the correlogram of a pair of forelegs
          shown on the top row indicates a statistically
          significant rhythm, the foreleg pair shown on the bottom
          row is tabulated as rhythmic even though the correlogram
          does not achieve statistical significance. In an effort
          to include any specimen that could be judiciously
          apprehended as rhythmic, we applied this conservative
          criterion to obtain the data shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2</ENAMEX>. We
          also show our analysis in graphic form for data averaged
          from each tissue of a given type to illustrate effects of
          
          cry 
          b in cases for which only the
          rhythmic specimens were included (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 4</NUMEX>; also
          see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>).
          The 
          cry 
          b mutation significantly reduced
          the number of rhythmic specimens for each of the body
          parts we assayed as measured by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> in LD
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:12</TIMEX>, with the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Moreover, whereas, on average, all of the 
          luc -reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> were
          significantly rhythmic in a 
          cry +background, the minor fraction
          of 
          cry 
          b specimens that appeared rhythmic
          (based on the shape of the correlogram) were not always
          significantly rhythmic on average. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant</ENAMEX> rhythmicity
          that passed muster in that manner was evident for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and antennal pairs. In
          addition, 
          BG-luc; cry 
          b (but not 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-luc; cry 
          b ) cycles were significantly
          rhythmic in the forelegs. Otherwise, the mutation
          eliminated significant rhythmicity.
          We were interested in whether the mutant specimens
          that retained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> appeared normal. In this
          regard, a potentially more informative indication of the 
          cry 
          b effect was provided by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhythmicity</ENAMEX> Index (RI), an estimate of a rhythm's
          strength that draws on the autocorrelation read-outs (see
          Tables 1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX> as well as [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] for further discussion of this parameter). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> values
          indicated that the strengths of rhythmicity from the LD
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:12 monitorings</TIMEX> were significantly lowered by 
          cry 
          b for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> and in all of
          the body parts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Table 2</ENAMEX>). Thus, the 
          cry 
          b mutation reduces the strength of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycling</ENAMEX> in these body parts; in other words, these
          rhythms are less robust than in the 
          cry +controls.
          In Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>, plots of average counts for
          each tissue are presented, based on the rhythmic subset
          of specimens tabulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and</ENAMEX> 2for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:12</TIMEX>.
          These average signals indicate once again that 
          cry 
          b impinges on clock-gene cyclings.
          For example, with the exception of the 
          BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">luc</NUMEX> -reported wing data shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4d</TIMEX>, simple inspection of the raw data column
          suggests that 
          cry 
          b reduces or eliminates such
          cyclings under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LD 12</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX> (compare the raw data for 
          cry +v 
          cry 
          b for example, in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b</TIMEX>, or
          3c). The appearance of rhythmicity in the 
          cry 
          b specimens is mostly revealed
          after detrending and normalization (see Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5,</ENAMEX>
          6the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> column labeled normalized). However, in the
          case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> - for which there were very few
          rhythmic 
          cry 
          b samples (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) - no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> is evident in the averaged plots. One
          explanation for this could be that the separate rhythms
          are not in phase with one another or are noisy; thus the
          average may not appear to be rhythmic. Nevertheless,
          applying autocorrelation to the averaged <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX>-courses
          revealed daily cyclings to have occurred in all cases
          except for the average taken from the rhythmic subset of 
          BG-luc; cry 
          b bodies. These results show that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> is evident in the mean signal as well as when
          it was initially tabulated on a specimen by specimen
          basis (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). Nevertheless, there
          might not have been agreement between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> views of
          rhythmicity for any of the tissues (or between different
          approaches to the analysis of phase as described below).
          Although it is unlikely that arrhythmic specimens would
          give rise to a mean rhythm, it is conceivable that
          rhythmic specimens might give rise to an arrhythmic
          mean.
        
        
          Output from phase analysis
          We measured the time of peak luciferase activity for
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> daily cycles included in the monitoring
          and analysis of a given specimen (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods). A mean peak time (per day) was thereby
          calculated for each specimen, with such a value taken as
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> phase for that specimen. One goal of
          quantifying the molecular phases was to compare the
          normal 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-luc time-course values to the 
          BG-luc ones for each tissue in a 
          cry +genetic background. For this,
          we used circular statistics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 32</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, the
          phase of each specimen is plotted as a time point
          (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). An average vector is calculated based on
          the distribution of phase points around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> circle.
          The angle of the vector corresponds to the mean phase for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of points, and the magnitude of the vector
          represents the variability in the phase estimates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson-Williams</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> statistic was applied to
          evaluate whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such vectors are significantly
          different from one another [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Significant
          differences were evident in the phase of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clock
          genes' cyclical expression under a light-dark cycle, for
          all tissues except isolated antennal pairs and the heads
          (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.
          From similar analyses performed on the 
          BG-luc data in a 
          cry +vs a 
          cry 
          b background, the mutation was
          revealed to affect the phase of 
          BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">luc</NUMEX> -reported cycling in all
          tissues except <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, and note that there
          were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> rhythmic 
          BG-luc; cry 
          b samples for analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bodies</ENAMEX>, respectively; and that neither one of the mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> representing these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> is significant by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rayleigh</ENAMEX>'s test). Thus 
          cry 
          b 's effect on the phase of these
          molecular rhythms is as potent as the effect on cycling
          as such.
          The analysis of phase presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7and</NUMEX> Figure
          8relies on an average estimate of phase for each specimen
          and it neglects any variability in the occurrence of
          peaktime associated with the daily rhythm in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioluminescence</ENAMEX>. As noted above, the mean vectors
          depicted within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8represent</NUMEX> a
          vector average of the individual phase estimates with the
          direction of the vector indicating the mean time and the
          length of the vector indicating the variability
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dispersion</NUMEX>) of the estimates. An alternative analysis,
          presented in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, preserves the intraspecimen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>. This analysis, called a bivariate analysis [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] , represents an individual specimen as a vector in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">x-y plane</ENAMEX>. The position of each point (plotted as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asterisk</ENAMEX> or an open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX>) is determined by the
          variability of the occurrence of the peak for that
          individual record. Thus, the points that fall on the
          diameter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> are precisely consistent from day
          to day, while those falling closer to the origin indicate
          greater variability. The position of the point within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">circle</ENAMEX> describes the mean peak time for each specimen. In
          this way, each point indicates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a vector that
          summarizes the phase for a particular specimen. The tail
          of the vector would connect the point to the origin but
          we do not plot the vectors this way because the figure
          would be difficult to interpret. A statistical comparison
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (in this case 
          per-luc v 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-luc or 
          per-luc; cry +v 
          per-luc; cry 
          b ) is obtained by first
          calculating a mean vector that connects the origin to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the cloud of points defined by the respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and then testing whether or not these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative vectors</ENAMEX> are different from one
          another.
          The results shown in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9and</NUMEX> 10are consistent
          with those in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7and 8</NUMEX>, but the interpretation of
          the figures is different. For example, Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8e</TIMEX>(on the
          right) shows that the 
          cry 
          b mutation affects the mean peak
          phase significantly; this difference is evident in the
          distribution of the mean phase estimates estimates
          plotted outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> on the right in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.
          When these same 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luc</ENAMEX> records are plotted using the
          bivariate method as shown in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, both the
          temporal distribution and the intraspecimen variability
          determine the placement of individual points within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX> (on the right in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10e</NUMEX>). The plot in Figure
          10eshows much more detail about the rhythmic output
          generated by each specimen; it is clear that the 
          cry +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">forelegs</ENAMEX> produced a stable
          rhythm in nearly all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> cases as indicated by the
          presence of the asterisks on or near the edge of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, it is readily apparent from
          this plot that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> rhythmic 
          cry 
          b specimens are more variable in
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> timing of peak phase because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of
          the points representing this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are plotted within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>, relatively closer to the origin than the 
          cry +points. Nevertheless, the
          statistical test that corresponds to the treatment of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> depicted in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10only</TIMEX> tells us that the
          phases are different; it is not possible to determine
          whether this difference comes from the temporal
          distribution or the variability or a combination of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. Therefore, the interpretation of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          phase analyses is that there is a significant effect of 
          cry 
          b on the peak phase of the clock in
          the foreleg (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) and that there is also an
          effect of this variant on the mean occurrence of peak
          phase (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9and 10</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Effects of cry b on antennal rhythms in constant
          darkness and constant temperature
          Temporally varying LUC activity was examined for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antennal</ENAMEX> pairs in constant darkness (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>) to assess
          whether 
          cry 
          b affects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>running rhythmicity.
          As noted above, these rhythms may appear to be weaker in
          constant conditions than under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LD 12</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Earlier studies have shown that the amplitude of rhythms
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> is reduced compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . These
          observations could reflect a weakening of synchrony
          between, for example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> antennae within a well, or
          between multiple clock cells within a specimen. But the
          method for monitoring 
          luc activity can also contribute to
          the appearance of damping within a record.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> as well as nonlinear trends in the data come
          into play in experiments using luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
          technology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Such artifacts were shown (in one
          substrate replenishment experiment) to be the result of
          inevitable depletion of luciferin from the medium
          surrounding the tissues over time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Removal of
          these trends quantitatively clarifies the record of
          bioluminescent activity with regard to any rhythmicity
          that might be present [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The normalization
          procedure we use (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1and</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] for more detail)
          exposes the rhythm (if one is present) in a manner that
          is quantifiable without reference to the type of
          measurement that has been employed (for example,
          counts-per<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-second</TIMEX> metric on the ordinate of the relevant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plots</ENAMEX> becomes dimensionless). One salutary consequence is
          that comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> - differing, for example,
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> part-are based on the nature of the rhythmicity
          per se (independent of tissue-dependent levels of overall
          reporter expression). Therefore, the use of computational
          techniques to detrend and normalize the signals permitted
          us to extract and characterize rhythms for comparative
          analysis - clearing out other features that were deemed
          relatively unimportant in terms of the manner by which
          tissue-type, background genotype, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> type would
          influence the appreciation of these clock-gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclings</ENAMEX>.
          As indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, the effects of 
          cry 
          b in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> are consistent with its
          effects in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">LD 12:12</TIMEX>. In constant conditions, the mutation
          significantly reduced the number of rhythmic antennal
          pairs for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>. However, degrees of rhythmicity
          were also impinged on by the conditions alone, in that
          only the 
          BG-luc; cry +<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> were
          significantly rhythmic on average.
          From a more quantitative perspective, the mean RI
          value resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> monitorings was decreased by
          an order of magnitude in the 
          cry 
          b mutation compared to 
          cry +for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-luc as well as 
          BG-luc activity (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This
          effect of 
          cry 
          b is further underscored by an
          analogous effect on rhythm amplitude. The measures of
          mean amplitudes given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2stem</ENAMEX> from computing
          the distances (as graphed) from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the peak</TIMEX> (or trough) to
          the "mean line" running through plots of the detrended
          and normalized signals, 
          cry 
          b caused amplitude decrements for
          the time-courses mediated by expression of both 
          luc -fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> types (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          This 
          cryptochrome mutation produced
          dramatic effects on the phase of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>:
          The mean-phase values were estimated to occur <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 7</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> earlier for 
          cry 
          b antennae compared to the 
          cry +appendages. This effect of 
          cry 
          b indicates that the gene may
          contribute to regulation of the endogenous phase for the
          antennal clock. Alternatively, the extreme difference in
          phase could indicate the loss of synchrony between
          multiple clock cells within the antennae consistent with
          the large decrease seen in the RI value. These results
          suggest that 
          cry may normally play a role in the
          determination of clock time or, alternatively, that it
          may act to synchronize clock time between individual
          clock cells.
          Previous studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cryptochrome</ENAMEX>'s chronobiological
          role in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> emphasized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRY</ENAMEX> may
          function as a deep brain photoreceptor involved in
          mediating resetting of the clock by light [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
          Support for this hypothesis came from the observation
          that locomotor-activity rhythms in 
          cry 
          b flies are unaffected in constant
          darkness and also maintain rhythmicity under constant
          light, a condition that causes behavioral arrhythmicity
          in the wild type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . While antennal rhythms of gene
          expression and of odor sensitivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> are
          significantly attenuated in 
          cry 
          b tissues ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , unlike
          locomotor rhythmicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ), it remained possible that
          such effects are due to an altered role of light on the
          developing clock. To address this possibility, we reared
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and prepared antennal samples in a
          temperature cycle (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">27°C:18°C</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> and then tested the
          antennal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in constant darkness at a constant warm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">temperature 27°</ENAMEX> (here called HH - for constant high
          temperature - to distinguish this experiment from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard LD</ENAMEX> rearing-><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> tests described above).
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, the effects of 
          cry 
          b on molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> in HH
          are similar to what was observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> and (standard)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> monitorings. The number of rhythmic specimens was
          significantly reduced by the mutation for both 
          BG-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">luc</NUMEX>- and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">luc</NUMEX>- reported rhythms. However,
          very few of the rhythmic specimens, among either 
          cry +or 
          cry 
          b antennal pairs, was significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">periodic</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Further, unlike what was found in
          the other conditions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> values stemming from the HH
          test were similar across genotypes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>.
          Similiarly, there was no effect of the 
          cry 
          b mutant on the amplitude of the
          normalized rhythmic output of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> in these
          experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          A combined effect of the temperature regimen together
          with that of 
          cry 
          b was detected on the phase of
          molecular cycling: A mutationally induced difference of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 hours</TIMEX> was observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HH</ENAMEX> as opposed to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 hours</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>.
          The direction of the 
          cry 
          b -induced phase modification was
          the same as that observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> at a lower temperature.
          More generally (and aside from the genotypic effect),
          high:low entrainment, followed by subjecting these
          isolated appendages to a constant high temperature,
          caused a phase effect: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak</ENAMEX> times of LUC-reported
          cyclings were shifted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> earlier in the HH
          tests - respectively, for 
          BG-luc; cry +and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-luc; cry +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">antennae</NUMEX> - compared
          with the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> rearing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> monitoring.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have developed a tool kit for the analysis of
        cyclical data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and here have applied it to molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> involving circadian clocks in isolated tissues of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> features of this
        approach: the evaluation of rhythmicity and the evaluation
        of phase, have been emphasized.
        The first prominent feature is the application of
        filters for normalizing and detrending the raw time-course
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Such a preparation may indicate whether or not a
        rhythmic signal is present, as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        Subsequent criteria are evaluated by means of the
        autocorrelation function to determine whether a rhythm is
        present in the data and, if so, whether it is statistically
        significant. However, we do not rely on statistical
        significance as an absolute test of rhythmicity. On the one
        hand, statistical confidence provides a quantitative
        standard that removes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> bias; on the other hand,
        biological signals can fail this test while still
        displaying the features of rhythmicity. We have adopted a
        strategy for addressing this complexity based on several
        criteria as discussed in the companion paper [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The
        overall approach is somewhat subjective, yet it is
        systematic and does not rely on an arbitrary decision about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periodicity</ENAMEX> in the data. We evaluate each record - blind to
        treatment or genotype - as raw data or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">normalized</ENAMEX>/detrended
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. If the shape of the autocorrelation function displays
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periodicity</ENAMEX> (a sinusoidal pattern) in the circadian range,
        we accept the presence of rhythmicity and quantify the
        strength of the rhythm using the RI value. In addition, we
        keep track of which samples are significantly rhythmic and
        which samples are not with the RS metric (see Tables 1and
        2for examples). Although we go into this matter more
        thoroughly in the companion paper, we reiterate here that
        this subjective use of the autocorrelation function to
        establish rhythmicity is not unprecedented; in fact, it has
        been recommended as a valid approach to situations like our
        experiments where the number of data points is relatively
        small [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . In general, it must be noted that the use of
        both tabulated and averaged data also supports this
        approach. For example, the average of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> values given
        for the rhythmic 
        per-luc <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antennal samples</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> as
        indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2is</ENAMEX> lower than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> values shown for
        the mean signal presented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>. This difference
        occurs because the rhythmicity expressed by individual
        samples within the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is similar and the
        averaging process (portrayed in the plotted data shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>) tends to strengthen the rhythms in question and
        to eliminate idiosyncracies within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given record</TIMEX>.
        Thus, we have quantified how the 
        cry 
        b mutation affects molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. First, it reduces the number of
        rhythmic peripheral-tissue specimens in all cases, except -
        and most intriguing - for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, even when only
        the rhythmic 
        cry 
        b versus 
        cry +specimens are considered, the
        former genotype causes a significant reduction of RI
        values, with the exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">antennal</NUMEX> pairs whose
        molecular time-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> were monitored at constant
        temperature.
        A variety of claims have been made about the phase of
        clock gene expression in various tissues and cell types.
        While immunohistochemical studies have suggested that the
        course of wild-type 
        per cycling may differ between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoreceptors</ENAMEX> and neurons in the central brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ,
        molecular studies have suggested that there is no
        difference between the phase of 
        per mRNA cycling in photoreceptors
        vs. the rest of the head (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35</NUMEX>). The interpretation of such
        studies is complicated by the inability to assess phase
        over several cycles within a specimen. However, even when
        such measurements have been facilitated by the use of
        real-time monitoring of 
        luc -<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, there has been an
        assertion that phase is essentially the same amongst
        isolated tissues [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Nevertheless, given our
        observation that the effects of the 
        cry 
        b variant may be tissue-specific, as
        well as the use of both 
        per-luc and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-luc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, we re-examined
        this question quantitatively.
        Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> analytic feature we emphasize is the
        analysis of phase. We have applied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complementary
        approaches. The first approach uses circular statistics to
        evaluate the distribution of peak phase estimates. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> approach uses a bivariate analysis that reveals
        intraspecimen variability as well as mean peak time to test
        differences in phase. Specifically, we applied these
        methods to ask whether the two 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> ( 
        BG-luc and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim-luc</ENAMEX> ) peak at the same time in a 
        cry +(and otherwise clock-normal
        genetic background) and also whether the 
        cry 
        b mutation influences peak phase of
        the 
        BG-luc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>.
        The observation of tissue-specific phase relationships
        between 
        per-luc and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim-luc</ENAMEX>, along with the apparent
        difference in the absolute timing of phase is not
        surprising. Such differences could be explained both on the
        basis of differences in cell types and differences in
        function. Whereas peripheral clocks are not necessarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuronal</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , it is conceivable that tissue specific
        differences in the intracellular environment would force
        different peak times on the clock mechanism. Further, based
        on the tissue specific effects of 
        cry 
        b it is possible that the
        configuration of a clock mechanism may vary between
        different cell types. For example, the full ensemble of
        clock factors present within these various tissues is not
        yet known.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Following our previous development of a collection of
        analytical tools for the study of molecular and behavioral
        cycles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , we now provide intensively performed
        examples of the analysis of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythms</ENAMEX> in isolated
        tissues from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>. In the main, but by no
        means exclusively, the current analyses were applied to
        published data revolving round effects of the 
        cryptochrome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> as it functions in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>'s circadian system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        . The results of the present study show that procedures for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detrending</ENAMEX> and normalizing the data clarify the presence
        versus absence of rhythmicity - which tend strongly to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with 
        cry +functioning versus that
        putatively remaining in the 
        cry 
        b mutant - as well as permitting a
        more detailed understanding of the features accompanying a
        given molecular time-course. Our conclusions from extended
        and deepened analyses of these clock-gene cyclings are
        consistent with those in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ,
        including the matter of peripheral-tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rhythms</ENAMEX> being
        dependent in part on CRY-mediated functions. Moreover,
        current applications of our phase analysis uncovered new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>. These components of the tool-kit reveal that 
        cry 
        b alters the phase of 
        period and 
        timeless gene expressions, suggesting
        further that - at least in the periphery - CRY plays a
        quasi-central role in molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">timekeeping</ENAMEX>. More broadly,
        in peripheral tissues whose genotype was clock-normal,
        phase differences that were evident among the different
        body parts strengthen the notion that overall features of
        the timekeeping mechanisms vary according to the local
        molecular milieu. This is perhaps as it should be - because
        why would a structure such as the antenna necessarily wish
        to exhibit a maximum or mininim value for a given piece of
        clock-output that might be the same as those elaborated
        within the fly's legs?
        The development of analytical strategies for analyzing
        biological time-series will continue to be important as new
        real-time methods (potentially including images of tissues)
        provide greater access to molecular and physiological
        cycles. Such strategies add depth as well as detail to the
        study of biological time-keeping mechanisms.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Peripheral tissues were dissected from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> as described
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krishnan et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The 
        per-luc (BG-luc) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">luc</NUMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were
        originally described elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Automated
        monitorings of luciferase (LUC) activity were the same
        previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 23</NUMEX> ] . All of the data from
        light-dark cycles (LD <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:12</TIMEX>) and from constant darkness
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>) were from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monitorings</ENAMEX> reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krishnan et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , although most of the pertinent data were not
        separated as to 
        per-luc versus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tim</ENAMEX>-luc expressions, and many of the
        results were included as supplementary material. Additional
        
        cry +specimens in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, which did
        not appear in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> report, have been included here,
        substantially to augment the appreciation of normal
        clock-gene cycling in isolated tissues. We also include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from additional experiments collected under constant
        high temperature (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">27°C</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . These data were collected
        after the submission of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> report.
        In these new experiments flies were reared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> and in
        temperature cycles (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-hr 27°C: 12-hr 18°C</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        day-old ether-anesthetized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were collected and housed
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> in these same conditions before the antennal
        pairs were dissected. The antennal pairs were placed
        immediately in luciferin-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX> and transferred to the luminometer (as described in
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ), where they were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> additional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of
        the temperature-cycle in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX> before being maintained at a
        constant temperature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">27°C</ENAMEX> for the duration of the
        LUC-monitoring runs.
        The basic flow-chart for handling data from a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX> and from an ensemble of like ones was as follows:
        Each record was evaluated for an adequate level of
        expression above 'no-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specimen</ENAMEX>' background to insure that
        the tissue had survived and was producing valid data [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cf.</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] ]. If expression levels were adequate, the specimen
        was assessed for rhythmicity. Temporally varying LUC
        activity was detrended and normalized as described in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Next, autocorrelation analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] was
        performed to look for a rhythmic pattern of activity. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlogram</ENAMEX> is a plot that reports correlation-coefficient
        values on the vertical axis versus time-lags plotted on the
        horizontal axis. Zero lag always provides a value of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        because the correlation is perfect between the activity
        record and a copy of itself at each point. However, as one
        copy of the activity record is shifted along the time axis
        (in either direction) by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point (in other words, a lag
        of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>), the correlation falls off. This process is
        repeated, and a correlation coefficient is calculated for
        the activity record against itself for each lag shown in
        the correlogram (see bottom row of Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1for</TIMEX> an example).
        If the correlation coefficients fall and rise in a periodic
        fashion, resembling a sinusoidal curve, the record of LUC
        activity is "rhythmic." As to whether such periodicity is
        significant, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval is calculated based
        on the number of observations in the experiment. Rhythmic
        activity is statistically significant if the peaks and
        troughs of the autocorrelation function cross the boundary
        set by the confidence interval centered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlogram</ENAMEX> (for further detail see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and references
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">therein</ENAMEX>). As noted above in Results text, we do not require
        statistical significance to score a record as rhythmic. The
        appearance of rhythmicity in the correlogram is applied as
        a qualitative criterion so that we do not treat weakly
        rhythmic data as arrhythmic data. The justification for
        this strategy is given in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levine et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, we keep track of the number of specimens that
        generated statistically significant rhythms as indicated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        We quantify the strength of a rhythm with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aforementioned Rhythmicity</ENAMEX> Index. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> is the height of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> peak of the correlogram [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 31</NUMEX> ] . Whereas the
        confidence interval for the correlogram is based solely on
        the number of observations, the RI value is based on the
        robustness of any regular fluctuations in the data. For
        example, we record LUC activity <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour</TIMEX>. If we increased
        the sampling frequency from once every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX> to once
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every 30 or 15 minutes</TIMEX>, the confidence interval would
        become smaller while the shape and amplitude of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlogram</ENAMEX> would presumably remain unchanged from the
        curve obtained by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minute</TIMEX> sampling. The RI value,
        however, would not vary, while the estimates of statistical
        significance would vary according to the sampling
        frequency.
        It is nevertheless informative to monitor the
        statistical significance of periodicities; for this we
        devised a ratio that allows us to track whether or not a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX> is significantly rhythmic, the so-called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhythmicity Statistic</ENAMEX> (RS). An RS value is a ratio of the
        RI value to the absolute value of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence line.
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> is equal to or greater than the numerical height of
        the confidence line, then the rhythm is significant (by
        definition, the height of the peak is ≥ the height of the
        confidence interval used to determine statistical
        significance). Alternatively, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> is less than the
        confidence line, the rhythm is not statistically
        significant. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RS</ENAMEX> provides a numerical accounting of
        significance for an individual specimen or an average
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>.
        We define the amplitude of a rhythmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUC</ENAMEX> time-course as
        the (plotted) distance (in arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>) from the mean
        peak or mean trough of the normalized activity record to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        (the latter is always the mean value of detrended and
        normalized data, as exemplified in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The complete
        range of the rhythm is twice the amplitude.
        Most of the analyses applied in the current study were
        described in detail in the companion paper [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . We
        augmented such treatments of the data by developing two
        additional parameters, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhythmicity Statistic</ENAMEX> (RS) and a
        metric that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specification</ENAMEX> of cycling amplitude.
        Analyses leading to the rhythmic parameters were applied to
        individual samples; their averages appear in Tables 1and 2.
        In addition, averages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LUC</ENAMEX> data computed across all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> within a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (which varied as to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> part,
        
        luc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> type, and 
        cry allele) were obtained; and such
        averaged time-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> were formally analyzed, as shown in
        Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and Figures 5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Consequently, there are
        differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tables</ENAMEX> and Figures in values of
        parameters such as the Rhythmicity Index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX>, see below),
        because the tables specify the means determined from
        individual-specimen analyses, while the figures provide
        parameters determined after computing the average
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-courses.
        Maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entropy Spectral Analysis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MESA</ENAMEX>) was employed to
        estimate the period of a rhythm, i.e., for a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-course previously determined to be significantly
        periodic by correlogram. This method is presented in detail
        elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 27</NUMEX> ] .
        We have discussed the analysis of phase using circular
        statistics in the companion paper [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, an
        average estimate of peak phase, obtained for each specimen,
        is plotted as a point on a unit circle. A mean vector,
        extending from the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> circle towards the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX> is calculated for each group of points; the
        direction of the vector indicates mean peak phase for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> and the length of the vector represents the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> or dispersion between the points (phase
        estimates for each specimen). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson-Williams</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>
        test returns an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>statistic for the comparison of vectors
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to determine whether they represent
        significantly different estimates of phase (see Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>,
        6and [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 32</NUMEX> ] for further detail).
        One disadvantage of this phase analysis is the loss of
        information about the variability of phase across cycles
        for each specimen. Therefore, we have also introduced
        another approach using bivariate statistics to represent
        the molecular cycles more completely [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In this
        approach, the record of each specimen is represented as the
        tip of a vector whose direction indicates the mean phase
        estimate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as above</NUMEX>) and whose distance from the origin in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">x-y plane</ENAMEX> represents intraspecimen variability (see
        Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> appears as a distribution of
        points. A mean vector extending from the origin to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the distribution is calculated to describe the
        overall mean peak phase and variability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        points (see Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, for example). Finally, the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are compared using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotelling</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample test to
        determine whether the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> are different. If
        a significant difference between vectors is obtained, this
        method does not specify whether the difference is due to
        the variability, the peak phase estimate or some
        combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
        All of the analyses described above as well as the
        subsequent output (the figures) come from programs written
        for the current study and the just-previous one [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
        using Matlab6 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathworks</ENAMEX>). This software is available on
        request.
