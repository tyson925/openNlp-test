        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuberculosis</ENAMEX> is estimated to cause at least three
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> deaths per year worldwide [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and also accounts
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one-quarter</NUMEX> of all preventable adult deaths
        in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Infection with the human
        immuno-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency virus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) is thought to be the single
        most important factor that has contributed to the increased
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> globally in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuberculosis</ENAMEX> is now the leading cause of death among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> worldwide and accounts for at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of deaths among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, tuberculosis kills more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than any
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious disease</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Reports have suggested that responses to tuberculosis
        differ between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and that barriers to early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> and treatment of tuberculosis may be greater for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX> study performed among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ethiopian Jews</ENAMEX> who immigrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> found that women
        had an incidence rate of tuberculosis that was twice that
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> cases per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, studies have suggested that
        progression from tuberculosis infection to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> may be
        faster in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of reproductive age than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of the same
        age [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . Nonetheless, there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 2</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> male
        to female ratio in the number of tuberculosis cases
        notified to public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , indicating
        that any increase in the risk of development of
        tuberculosis that reproductive stress may confer upon women
        is transient. Despite this disparity in case notifications,
        mortality from tuberculosis is similar among young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        The literature lacks information on the relationship
        between gender, tuberculosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-infection, and the
        outcome of tuberculosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. Studies that have
        examined gender relationships in tuberculosis patients
        found a similar proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zambia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        . Among younger age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, female tuberculosis patients
        were more likely to be HIV-infected than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> whereas the
        opposite was found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">older</TIMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost 1.5 million</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> were estimated to have been infected with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> were estimated to have tuberculosis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The total number of notifications of
        tuberculosis cases of all forms has been steadily rising in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14,740</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,196</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> (an increase
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 90%</NUMEX>), even with an estimated case detection rate of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 44%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        This report describes an investigation of the
        relationship between gender and the baseline presentation
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> outcome in a cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> pulmonary
        tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in on tuberculosis treatment in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between March 1993 and March 1995</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 to 50 year</TIMEX> old

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuberculosis Treatment Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kampala</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> in a
          prospective cohort study. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received
          anti-tuberculosis treatment consisting of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> of
          daily self-administered isoniazid (INH), rifampicin,
          ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> of
          daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INH</ENAMEX> and rifampicin, which was the recommended first
          line treatment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>
          (WHO).
          Other inclusion criteria included residence within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>

          ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria
          included previous tuberculosis or tuberculosis treatment,
          serious co-morbidity such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypertension</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> or antiretroviral use (since there
          was no consistent policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> on the use of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> at the time of the study, which included treatment
          of oral thrush, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and
          recurrent bacterial infections. Antiretroviral therapy
          was not the standard of practice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> during the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Peripheral blood</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lymphocyte</NUMEX> counts were measured

          contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who defaulted on clinic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointments</ENAMEX>.
          The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the

          participation.
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          We investigated the influence of gender on the
          likelihood that a study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> achieved a favorable
          outcome (i.e., alive and cured of tuberculosis) or an
          unfavorable outcome (i.e., dead or not cured of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX>) after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> from the initiation of
          anti-tuberculosis treatment. Vital status was determined
          through interviews of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-fast bacilli sputum smear and culture negative
          at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> follow-up sputum examination were
          considered cured. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> whose status could be
          assigned into either of the two outcome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
          included in the analysis. We evaluated the bivariate
          relationships between gender and outcome with selected
          baseline covariates, and constructed a time-series
          repeated measures regression model [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] to describe
          the influence of gender on the outcome using data at
          baseline and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. We chose the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time-series</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> because it accounts for the variations
          of covariates within the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with time. A
          proportional-hazards regression model was used to assess
          the influence of gender on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> survival. All
          analyses were performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS/STAT ®</ENAMEX>(version

        Results
        Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with pulmonary tuberculosis
        who were enrolled into the cohort study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) whose
        outcome status was known as either favorable (i.e., alive
        and cured of tuberculosis) or unfavorable (i.e., dead or
        not cured of tuberculosis) after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> of initiation of
        anti-tuberculosis treatment formed the sample for this
        analysis. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose status could not
        be determined had withdrawn from the study before
        completion of treatment.
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX>) were male and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>)
        were female (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). At baseline, male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        significantly older and had higher body mass indices (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>)
        than female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        similar educational levels and marital status. There was no
        statistically significant difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in the frequency and previous duration of symptoms
        of tuberculosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>, fevers, hemoptysis and sweats) and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-infection-associated conditions (herpes zoster,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX> and thrush), and Karnofsky
        performance scores at baseline. However, female patients
        had significantly higher mean serum β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -microglobulin levels, while male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had significantly higher hemoglobin levels. There
        was no difference in baseline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ cell counts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PPD</ENAMEX> skin
        test reactivity between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> from the time of initiation of
        anti-tuberculosis treatment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214</NUMEX> study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had experienced a favorable outcome (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In
        a comparison of baseline characteristics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        developed a favorable outcome were similar in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> to those
        with an unfavorable outcome but they had higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and had
        more years of education. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-infection-associated symptoms though
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with an unfavorable outcome were more likely
        to have presented with a past history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>, diarrhea,
        and thrush. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a favorable outcome
        had larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PPD</ENAMEX> skin test reactions, higher absolute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+
        cell counts, lower serum β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> microglobulin levels, and were more
        likely to have fibrotic changes on their initial chest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">x-ray</ENAMEX>, than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with an unfavorable outcome.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who experienced a favorable outcome
        had significantly higher baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> performance
        status than those with an unfavorable outcome.
        In an unadjusted comparison between gender and outcome,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">82</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX>) of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had experienced a favorable outcome
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> (relative risk <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>). From the
        repeated measures model, female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were more likely
        to have a favorable outcome at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> although the effect
        was not statistically significant (OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>),
        after controlling for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count, serum β

        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 microglobulin</TIMEX> (OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.97</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.07</NUMEX>) were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a favorable outcome.
        Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with an unfavorable outcome 1-year
        after the beginning of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> treatment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> had died. Of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>) were female and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>)
        were male. The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died with the first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX> treatment and we did not conduct
        autopsies, additionally the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
        study were sputum culture negative at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX> of
        treatment. Because of this difference we created a
        proportional-hazards model to investigate the influence of
        gender on survival, controlling for baseline presentation
        of fever, diarrhea, serum β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> microglobulin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hemoglobin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cavitary disease</ENAMEX>, and extent of disease on
        chest x-ray. Female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were less likely to have died
        than male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (relative hazard [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX>] for death <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX>
        [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.21</NUMEX>]) but this protective effect was not
        statistically significant. Higher baseline <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RH 0.995</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.992</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.997</NUMEX>), hemoglobin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RH 0.81</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.68</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>), and lesser extent of disease on chest x-ray (RH
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.28</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>) were each significantly associated
        with better survival. Baseline serum β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> microglobulin levels had no effect on
        survival (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RH 1.03</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.13</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        We identified differences in the presentation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-associated tuberculosis between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>; however, there were no differences in outcomes or
        survival at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with pulmonary
        tuberculosis were younger, had lower body mass indices, and
        were more anemic than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> at the time of presentation. This
        is consistent with observations in other settings where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> has been shown to occur more among younger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of lower body mass
        indices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . However, in our study cohort, female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had higher serum β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> microglobulin levels at the time of
        diagnosis with tuberculosis, suggesting a possibly higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> burden [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] , than male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> despite
        comparable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> lymphocyte counts. In spite of their
        comparative disadvantage at presentation, female patients
        had a similar likelihood of a favorable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> treatment
        outcome.
        Studies have suggested that tuberculosis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> may
        have a particularly severe impact on young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in a
        low-income setting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . We did not find that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> fared any worse from tuberculosis than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudelson</ENAMEX> has suggested that delays in care seeking for
        tuberculosis among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may be compounded by stigma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . We found no gender
        difference in the duration of symptoms of tuberculosis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> prior to the diagnosis of tuberculosis in our study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX>.
        Differences in compliance with anti-tuberculous
        chemotherapy have been postulated to exist between female
        and male tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> have less
        access to funds for transport and personal health-care than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> do in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. We were unable to evaluate compliance
        because all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were encouraged to come back to the
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> by home health-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and those who
        defaulted on their treatment were often brought to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX>.
        Biologically there may be differences in immune
        responses to tuberculosis between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. It has
        been suggested that the immune response in tuberculosis may
        be closely related to differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> and males
        in type and concentration of non-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> and sex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormones</ENAMEX> secreted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , the direction of this
        response difference is, however, unclear. Cell mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> responses are depressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-calorie
        malnutrition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , and this could account for
        differences in the response to tuberculosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> had significantly lower body mass
        indices. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> would have experienced more
        unfavorable outcomes than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, which is not what we
        observed.
        This study is subject to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least</NUMEX> possible three
        limitations: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the relatively small sample size, could
        have contributed to our inability to detect clear gender
        differences in this study. To detect the observed crude
        relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.02</NUMEX> given the frequency of favorable
        outcomes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>,
        with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> power, the study would have
        needed to enroll about 9000 males and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9300</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        However, the modest gender differences in the presentation
        and the similarity in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> outcome that this study
        suggests could provide impetus for larger and longer
        studies in this area, or studies with a different design
        e.g., case-control studies. Using the repeated measures
        model methodology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] allowed us to use more data
        points, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each covariate</TIMEX> was updated at the different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points, and it gave us more power and a more robust
        estimation of the effect of gender on outcome than using
        baseline covariates would have done. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX> could be a differential follow-up rate between
        male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, leading to the apparent trend
        towards better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> outcomes in the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Nonetheless, we do not believe that there was a systematic
        difference in the follow-up rate by gender, and as
        indicated, home health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> followed up all patients
        similarly. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> potential limitation is that serum β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> microglobulin levels have not been
        shown to be associated with survival in HIV-infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on antiretroviral treatment, although high levels
        generally imply a higher burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. This
        restricts generalization of our results in terms of
        survival.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We conclude that female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> tuberculosis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have a similar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-year</TIMEX> outcome to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>, even though they have lower body mass indices,
        lower hemoglobin levels, and higher β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> microglobulin levels at presentation,
        which may indicate more advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV disease</ENAMEX> than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Because tuberculosis is the number one infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease killer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, it is imperative that public
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in areas of high <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and tuberculosis
        prevalence should encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to present for screening
        as soon as they experience the first signs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX>.
