        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Radiotherapy</ENAMEX> treatment planning is, in broad terms, the
        process of planning the delivery of a prescribed dose to a
        tumor or target volume while minimizing dose to the
        surrounding critical structures. Prior to the modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">radiotherapy</ENAMEX> treatment planning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, the 'optimum' plan was
        decided upon using qualitative criteria, or by estimating
        the inhomogeneity of the dose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> or in critical
        regions. With the advent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CT</ENAMEX>-based planning, the planning
        process could be done with increased precision, as
        3-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> representing the target and
        critical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> could be defined more accurately and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibly</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most useful tools which emerged in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3-dimensional</NUMEX> planning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> that could be used in
        establishing the acceptability or unacceptability of a
        treatment plan is the dose-volume histogram (DVH) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> is used ubiquitously and plots delivered dose on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis and percent volume of the structure of interest
        on the y-axis. The general shape and area under the DVH
        curve is instrumental in determining adequate coverage and
        homogeneity of dose in the target volume as well as in
        determining acceptable dose to critical structures. Indeed,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> has occupied a central role in modern treatment
        planning [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> is not without its limitations, however. First,
        there is an inherent loss of spatial information with the
        construction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> plot. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the dose plotted on the
        x-axis of a conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>) is conventional dose,
        which does not take into account many factors influencing
        the effects of the dose on the given tissue. Among them are
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">α/β</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (which can vary considerably for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> vs late reacting tissues and for early vs late
        reactions within the same tissue), time taken to deliver
        treatment, fraction size, and length of treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interruptions</ENAMEX>. For this reason, the concept of
        biological-effective dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED</ENAMEX>) was developed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] and
        has been studied extensively by the radiobiology community.
        Because the BED incorporates factors related to delivery of
        treatment and tissue factors, it is a better representation
        of the dose delivered to a given tissue than conventional
        dose [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        The application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED</ENAMEX> has particular importance to
        radiation treatment planning for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX>, more so than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> site, has been the
        focus of advances in treatment delivery technique. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX> has been the paradigm site for treatment planning
        efforts related to conformal therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] and
        intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)/inverse planning [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . Also, the prostate has been the leading disease
        site for efforts related to improving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> setup [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        and incorporating organ motion into the delivery strategy [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . These above efforts have allowed for dose escalation
        of the prostate while minimizing early and late treatment
        toxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13 14 17</NUMEX> ] .
        In view of the lead role the prostate has taken in
        understanding treatment planning, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> setup, and dose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">escalation</ENAMEX>, incorporation of treatment-related information
        into the DVH - to further facilitate advances in reduction
        of rectal or urinary toxicity - is highly appropriate. The
        purpose of the current investigation is to compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s
        of the bladder and rectum in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who developed
        late treatment toxicity versus those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not
        develop such toxicity, and, using the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, to determine whether the biological-effective DVH
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>) can potentially serve as a better tool for such
        toxicity comparisons than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        A generalized theoretical model for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
        biological effective dose has been developed and reported
        extensively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Recently, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has applied
        this model for use with any combination of short-lived
        interstitial brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> (unpublished/submitted data, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). For
        external <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam radiotherapy</ENAMEX>, the generalized BED model
        reduces to the familiar equation:
        BED = [n*d(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 + d/(α/β</ENAMEX>))] - [(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.693</NUMEX>*<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>)/(α*Tp)] (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        where n = number of treatments, d = dose per fraction, T
        = treatment time, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">α/β</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gy</ENAMEX>(for late effects), and Tp
        (potential doubling time) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α</NUMEX> (linear component of cell
        killing) were estimated from the published literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] , [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34 days</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.3/Gy</ENAMEX>, respectively. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) accounts for dose fractionation
        and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">term</TIMEX> accounts for repopulation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        recognize that there is considerable controversy in the
        exact values used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α/β</ENAMEX>, α, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tp</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> in
        the reported literature.
        The charts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1</ENAMEX> or T2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> treated with external <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam radiotherapy</ENAMEX> at
        our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996-1999</TIMEX> were reviewed. During
        this period, external <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam radiotherapy</ENAMEX> was delivered using
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-field technique, once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> times a week, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cGy</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> cGy fractions, to a final dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7000-7200</TIMEX> cGy
        (minimum PTV dose). The conformal techniques at our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> have been previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] - the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX>, seminal vesicles, rectum, and bladder were
        outlined routinely on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and uniform guidelines
        were adhered to in order to minimize inter-observer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the definition of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. In
        particular, with regard to the rectum, our institution
        followed routine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiation Therapy Oncology Group</ENAMEX> (RTOG)
        guidelines for definition - from the anus at the level of
        the ischial tuberosities {lower border} to the rectosigmoid
        junction {upper border} [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The bladder was contoured
        from the apex to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, again as outlined per RTOG
        guidelines. The planning target volume (PTV) was the
        prostate + seminal vesicles + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cm margin for the initial
        phase; after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4500-5000</TIMEX> cGy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTV</ENAMEX> was the prostate + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cm
        margin. Corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s were computed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTV</ENAMEX>,
        entire rectum (i.e., not the rectal wall or rectal
        surface), and entire bladder (again, not the bladder wall
        or bladder surface). The dose-fractionation and total
        treatment time for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> were recorded to obtain
        values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) above.
        No charts for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> were
        reviewed to ensure long minimum follow-up. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX> routine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follow-up</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GU</ENAMEX> complications using definitions
        and grading as stated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTOG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] were recorded.
        Thus, the charts were reviewed to identify those patients
        with significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTOG</ENAMEX> grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> (large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bowel</ENAMEX>) or GU (bladder) complications.
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2%</NUMEX>) were found to
        have late grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> rectal toxicity and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.2%</NUMEX>)
        were found to have late grade 3 urinary toxicity. No
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were found to have grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> or GU toxicity. A
        matched-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 GI and 6</ENAMEX> GU) with grade 0
        toxicity having similar pretreatment (age, stage, grade,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX>) and treatment (technique and dose) characteristics
        were identified from the same patient database. The
        characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are shown in comparison with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> demonstrating toxicity in Tables
        1and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The limitations and potential biases inherent to a
        matched-pair comparison are well-understood by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>;
        however, as these tables demonstrate, there is no
        difference in the pretreatment and treatment
        characteristics between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> demonstrating and not
        demonstrating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GU</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>] toxicity.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s were already constructed (prior to
        undertaking the current investigation) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - rectal, grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -
        rectal, grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - bladder, grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> - bladder) - these are
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s that were approved by the attending radiation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oncologist</ENAMEX> prior to delivering the external beam treatment.
        Then, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s derived from each of the individual
        dose distributions were averaged over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - rectal, grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -
        rectal, grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - bladder, and grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> - bladder) to
        produce average <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s.
        Using equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), the time-dose fractionation
        parameters were incorporated to transform the conventional
        dose to BED at each conventional dose level. This allowed
        for the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s for all of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Then, in a process similar to that for the
        C-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s derived from each of the individual
        dose distributions were averaged over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - rectal, grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> -
        rectal, grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - bladder, and grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> - bladder) to
        produce average BED-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are aware of the
        recent efforts regarding advanced modeling concepts for
        evaluating the relationship between physical irradiation
        and biological damage on normal structures - in particular,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED</ENAMEX> provides a measure of biological effect at a point at
        which it is calculated - measuring the absolute biological
        effect over a volume having a non-uniform dose distribution
        formally requires the computation of the equivalent uniform
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX> (EUD) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . However, this caveat does not apply
        directly to the current task, because the goal of the
        current investigation is to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> (constructed using
        either conventional dose or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED</ENAMEX>) as a 
        relative measure of biological
        response, not as an absolute measure, and in this context
        constructing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BED computations</ENAMEX> and averaging the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s (both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s) over a patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was felt to be an appropriate methodology.
        After construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s, it was
        clear that the general shape of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were slightly
        different, as would be expected by the non-linear
        transformation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) above. In order to perform
        comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> matched pairs in an objective,
        reproducible, and systematic manner, the following measure
        of normalized difference in the average DVH was
        computed:
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) represents an attempt to compress the DVH
        difference information into a single quantity, and was felt
        to be a valid quantity as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s did not 'cross' - that
        is, the grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s were above and to the right of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grade 0 DVH</ENAMEX>'s at all dose (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED</ENAMEX>) levels. Furthermore,
        this approach was felt to be valid biologically, as
        integral dose to critical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> has been correlated by
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> with late treatment toxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are also aware of the special
        problems related to applying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> for tubular and
        surface structures (such as the rectum and bladder) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 31</NUMEX>
        ] . However, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s of the whole organs were used
        as the basis for the original clinical decision making on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> under consideration (i.e., those
        treated before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), it was felt that integral dose to the
        entire rectum and entire bladder would be appropriate as
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> measure for clinical comparison of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">versus C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) was applied to compute the δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> 's (both for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s) for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> matched-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> pairs in the
        rectal toxicity category and to each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        matched-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> pairs in the bladder toxicity category. In
        order to perform a statistical comparison between these
        matched-pair δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> 's obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and those
        obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s t-test was
        used.
        Although the treatment decisions were made with
        knowledge of the integral dose delivered to the critical
        structures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> recognize that there is controversy
        with regard to the classification of biological response of
        the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> under study in the current
        investigation. In particular, many recent reports (e.g., [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] ) suggest that the bladder and rectum may be serial
        rather than parallel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with regard to their
        biological response to radiation injury. Thus, an
        alternative measure of merit was chosen to complement the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> analysis above. Specifically, the percent volume
        receiving above a set high dose level (in this study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gy</ENAMEX>) was analyzed. The analogous expression to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
        is the following:
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) was applied in exactly the same manner as
        above to compute δ 
        V60 's for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s for
        both the bladder and rectum. It should be noted that when
        applying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> Gy
        conventional dose transforms [using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), assuming
        once-daily <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Gy</ENAMEX> fractions] to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gy</ENAMEX>; thus,
        V60 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s corresponds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">V100</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s.
        The statistical comparison between the matched-pair δ 
        V60 's obtained between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s was performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s t-test.
      
      
        Results
        As expected, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s (both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s) were
        predictive of rectal and urinary toxicity - that is, those
        that developed late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> or GU toxicity had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s that
        demonstrated more integral dose to the rectum or bladder
        than those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not develop such toxicity. This
        reinforces and validates the well-known and widespread use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s in evaluating external beam [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 24 25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX>
        ] and interstitial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] treatment plans for prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the comparison for the case of the
        conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s of the rectum. In this figure, the
        average <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX> of the rectum was computed for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        in the grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as well as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the grade
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The average DVH's are displayed - as is
        demonstrated, the grade 3 curve is to the right of and
        above the grade 0 curve. Similar analyses were done for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BED-DVH-Rectum</ENAMEX> (as demonstrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), for the
        C-DVH-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bladder</ENAMEX> (as demonstrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BED-DVH-Bladder</ENAMEX> (as demonstrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). It should be
        noted that in all cases, the average grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s -
        conventional or BED - were consistently above and to the
        right of the corresponding grade 0 curve at each dose (or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED</ENAMEX>) level from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to maximum, again validating the
        uniform comparison approach summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) and
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3shows</ENAMEX> the results of the detailed matched-pair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> analysis. In this table, the δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> 's obtained using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s for each of the matched-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> pairs is
        displayed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' t-test was used to obtain a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value for each of the rectal toxicity and bladder
        toxicity categories. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3displays</ENAMEX>, the δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> analysis demonstrates a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.036</NUMEX> for the rectal toxicity comparison, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.065</NUMEX> for the bladder toxicity comparison, suggesting that
        [when using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> as the measure of merit] the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s were
        significantly better-correlated (than the corresponding
        C-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s) with rectal toxicity, and marginally
        better-correlated with bladder toxicity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4displays</ENAMEX> the results of the matched-pair V60
        analysis. In this table, the δ 
        V60 's obtained using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s for each of the matched-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> pairs is
        displayed. This table demonstrates a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.021</NUMEX> for
        the rectal toxicity comparison, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.021</NUMEX> for
        the bladder toxicity comparison, suggesting that [when
        using V60 as the measure of merit] the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s were
        significantly better-correlated (than the corresponding
        C-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s) with rectal toxicity and with bladder
        toxicity.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The values for δ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> and δ 
        V60 are higher for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectum</ENAMEX> and bladder than for the counterpart <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s.
        Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V60</ENAMEX> are dosimetric endpoints used
        routinely for the evaluation of radiation treatment plans,
        this analysis suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s for the rectum and
        bladder correlate better with late toxicity than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX>'s
        and should be considered when attempting to minimize late
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GU</ENAMEX> toxicity after radiotherapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>.
        Because this analysis was performed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
        measures of merit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX>'s - the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the V60</TIMEX>, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> results reported <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">herein</ENAMEX> appear promising for the use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s.
        Because the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> having late grade 3/4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toxicity</ENAMEX> (which is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> but was chosen as the
        target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that is most likely to benefit from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incorporation of BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s into the process of treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>) was the focus of this initial investigation, the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the current study is understandably
        small. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> cases of late grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> toxicity represent
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 3%</NUMEX> of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> - this low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX> also applies to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cases of late grade 3/4
        GU toxicity. Assuming that the same low rate of late
        toxicity is maintained, the number of cases of such late
        complications will not increase significantly with a
        significant increase in size of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        while the results are encouraging for the correlation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s to rectal toxicity, the correlation to bladder
        toxicity using the integral dose/AUC endpoint did not reach
        statistical significance, likely due to the limitations in
        sample size. However, because the integral dose/AUC
        analysis did reach significance for the rectum, and because
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the V60</TIMEX> analysis did reach statistical significance for
        both the bladder and rectum, the results of the current
        investigation represent initial success with the
        application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX> concept.
        As one means of avoiding the statistical problems posed
        by evaluating late toxicity, analyzing early grade 3/4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toxicity</ENAMEX>, which has a higher incidence, may allow for
        greater statistical power in validating the BED-DVH
        concept. However, because the modeling for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tp</ENAMEX>, alpha,
        and alpha/beta is altogether different for early vs late
        structures and because the transformation between late to
        early parameters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Equations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>) above are nonlinear,
        the results of the current analysis (and corresponding
        conclusions) may be completely different from such an early
        toxicity analysis. For these reasons, the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BED-DVH</ENAMEX>'s
        for evaluating and predicting early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GU</ENAMEX> toxicity will
        be the subject of a separate communication.
        The results of the current investigation are encouraging
        - the well-known conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> can be successfully
        expanded to include treatment delivery, tissue biology, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time/fractionation</ENAMEX>-related information that better
        represents the true effect of the treatment on critical
        structures. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have expanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-DVH</ENAMEX> to
        include functional and spatial information [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 34 35</ENAMEX> ] ,
        but 
        the current investigation is the first
        report correlating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVH</ENAMEX> which has been expanded to include
        BED parameters with late treatment toxicity for prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer irradiation</ENAMEX> .
        Although the initial focus of this investigation was the
        study of late radiation effects on the rectum and bladder,
        there is no conceptual limitation to the use of the
        techniques described herein to study early effects of
        treatment (for acute toxicity assessment) or to study
        target structures (for outcome/survival analysis) at any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anatomic</ENAMEX> site. The results of the current investigation,
        while encouraging, are preliminary and require validation
        by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> - because of the low incidence of
        late grade 3/4 complications, such an analysis might be
        better undertaken at a multi-institutional level.
