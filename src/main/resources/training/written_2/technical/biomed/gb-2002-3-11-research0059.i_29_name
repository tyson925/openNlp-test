        All organisms possess an essentially fixed repertoire of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> determined by their genome sequence. They have
        evolved to survive varying internal and external
        environments by carefully controlling the abundance and
        activity of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to suit their conditions. To
        simplify this task, genes whose products function together
        are often under common regulatory control such that they
        are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinately</ENAMEX> expressed under the appropriate
        conditions. This property has been frequently exploited in
        the analysis of genome-wide expression data, as the
        experimental observation that a set of genes is coexpressed
        frequently implies that the genes share a biological
        function and are under common regulatory control [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have multiple roles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, however, and act
        with distinct sets of cooperating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to fulfill each
        role. Their genes are therefore coexpressed with different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes, each governed by a distinct regulatory
        mechanism, in response to the varying demands of the cell
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). This complicates the analysis of expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and calls for a more nuanced approach to data
        analysis.
        The yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae evolved in a
        niche in which the availability of nutrients and the
        conditions of growth vary constantly, and it possesses
        sophisticated mechanisms to choreograph the expression of
        its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in order to thrive - or at
        least survive - in a wide range of environmental
        conditions. These responses are governed by a complex,
        condition-specific regulatory system that transduces
        information through the cell to the nucleus, where gene
        expression is adjusted accordingly. Many of the individual
        components of this regulatory system function under
        particular conditions and govern the expression of
        overlapping sets of gene targets, allowing a given gene to
        be coexpressed with different gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in response to
        different conditions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). As a consequence, the
        targets of each regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> often display similar
        expression patterns in response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of conditions
        but divergent patterns under other situations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>).
        For example, the known targets of the oxidative
        stress-responsive transcription factor Yap1p are
        coordinately induced in response to conditions that inflict
        oxidative damage, but these genes are divergently expressed
        in response to other environmental changes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]. Similarly, the known targets of other transcription
        factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aft1p</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Zap1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pho4p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hac1p</TIMEX>,
        Hsf1p, and others) are similarly expressed only in response
        to certain environments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        The complexity of the regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> that governs
        yeast gene expression complicates the analysis of
        whole-genome expression data. Because of the connection
        between gene-expression regulation and gene product
        function, computational analysis of expression data is used
        extensively to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of similarly expressed
        genes. However, the central limitation of most of the
        commonly used algorithms is that they are unable to
        identify genes whose expression is similar to multiple,
        distinct gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, thereby masking the relationships
        between genes that are coregulated with different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        genes in response to different conditions. Consider, for
        example, k-means clustering [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]. The k-means algorithm
        partitions <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into a defined set of discrete clusters,
        attempting to maximize the expression similarity of the
        genes in each cluster (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). The algorithm is
        initiated by randomly partitioning the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is then
        represented by a 'centroid' (the mean expression pattern of
        genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>), and the genes are repartitioned to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> whose centroid is most similar to their expression
        pattern. The partitioning process is iterated until the
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partitions</ENAMEX> are stable (or some other stopping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> is met). The end result of the algorithm is a set
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> clusters of similarly expressed
        genes. However, a key property of this algorithm (and many
        others like it) is that each gene is assigned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> cluster, obscuring the relationships between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conditionally coregulated genes</ENAMEX> such as those shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This limitation is especially problematic when
        analyzing large gene-expression datasets that are collected
        over many experimental conditions, when many of the genes
        are likely to be similarly expressed with different groups
        in response to different subsets of the experiments. A
        number of methods have been developed to deal with complex
        relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Here, we
        explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such method - fuzzy k-means
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX>.
        Fuzzy k-means clustering [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] facilitates the
        identification of overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> by allowing
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> to belong to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The essential
        difference between fuzzy k-means clustering and standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering is the partitioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). Rather than the hard partitioning of
        standard k-means clustering, where genes belong to only a
        single cluster, fuzzy k-means clustering considers each
        gene to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of every cluster, with a variable
        degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'membership'</ENAMEX>. Each gene has a total membership of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> that is apportioned to clusters on the basis of the
        similarity between the gene's expression pattern and that
        of each cluster centroid. Genes whose expression patterns
        are very similar to a given centroid will be assigned a
        high membership in that cluster, whereas genes that bear
        little similarity to the centroid will have a low
        membership. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, genes can be assigned significant
        memberships to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> cluster, thus revealing genes
        whose expression is similar to multiple, distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        genes.
        We implemented a heuristic variant of fuzzy k-means
        clustering that incorporated principal component analysis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>) and hierarchical clustering to analyze published
        yeast genomic expression data that followed the response of
        cells to different environments. The method successfully
        identified clusters of functionally related genes and more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of known transcription factor targets
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. In the process of this analysis, we identified
        previously unrecognized similarities in the expression of
        yeast genes and uncovered correlations between the
        environmental conditions. We explored the regulation of
        gene expression by correlating the identified clusters with
        known regulatory elements present in the genes' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
        These details implicate mechanisms that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> use to
        orchestrate genomic expression programs in response to
        variable conditions.
      
      
        Results
        
          Fuzzy k-means clustering overview
          We implemented a version of the fuzzy k-means
          algorithm, based on a description by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gath</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geva</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],
          in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C++</ENAMEX> program called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FuzzyK</ENAMEX> (available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]; see
          Materials and Methods for complete details). We altered
          the algorithm in two fundamental ways: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, we
          performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> successive cycles of fuzzy k-means
          clustering, with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> rounds of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clustering</ENAMEX> performed on subsets of the data. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
          because the random initialization commonly used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering can have a profound impact on the
          results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>], we instead chose to initialize each
          clustering cycle by seeding prototype centroids with the
          eigen vectors identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> of the respective dataset
          (see below). Here we present an overview of the
          algorithm, followed by a discussion of the parameter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimization</ENAMEX>.
          The input of the program is a table of expression
          values, where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each row</TIMEX> represents a given gene's relative
          transcript abundance under the condition indicated in
          each column (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of clustering is
          initialized by defining 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/3</NUMEX> prototype centroids (where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is the total number of clusters
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> is the number of clustering <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>) as the most
          informative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/3</NUMEX> eigen vectors identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> of the input dataset (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The
          prototype centroids are refined in the subsequent steps:
          each gene is assigned a membership score to each of the
          prototype centroids, based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation
          between the gene's expression pattern and the centroid in
          question. Each of the centroid patterns is then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recalculated</ENAMEX> as the weighted mean of all of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns in the dataset, where each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>'s weight is proportionate to its membership in the
          corresponding cluster (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods for
          details regarding the calculations). Genes that have a
          large membership to a given centroid will contribute more
          to the mean, and the new centroid will migrate in the
          direction of those genes. The process of calculating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-centroid memberships and updating the centroids is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iterated</ENAMEX> until the centroid patterns become fixed (or
          until the termination criterion is met, as described in
          Materials and methods).
          After this initial round of fuzzy clustering,
          duplicate centroids (pairs whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation is
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9</NUMEX>) are averaged, and genes with a greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> correlation to any of the identified centroids
          are removed from the dataset (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
          The fuzzy k-means clustering steps described above are
          repeated on this smaller dataset to identify patterns
          missed in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> clustering cycle, and the new
          centroids are added to the set identified in the first
          round. The process of averaging replicated centroids and
          selecting a data subset is repeated, and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cycle of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> is performed on the subset of genes with a
          correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.7</NUMEX> to any of the existing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centroids</ENAMEX>. The newly identified centroids are combined
          with the previous sets, and replicate centroids are
          averaged.
          In the final step of the program, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> of
          each gene to each centroid is calculated. Thus, the
          output of the algorithm is twofold: the method presents a
          list of the unique centroids identified in the fuzzy
          clustering cycles along with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matrix</ENAMEX> representing the
          final membership scores for each gene to each centroid.
          In this representation, each gene can be related to all
          the identified clusters through its membership value,
          allowing genes that belong significantly to multiple
          clusters to be realized. As a consequence, each cluster
          consists of a continuous list of all of the genes in the
          dataset, ranked according to decreasing membership.
          The continuous clusters identified by fuzzy k-means
          clustering present a challenge in visualizing the
          clustering results. To this end, we have developed the
          program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FuzzyExplorer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> based on the program
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneExplorer</ENAMEX> (developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Rees; C. Rees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.O.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Botstein</ENAMEX>, unpublished results). Using this
          software, the genes that belong significantly to each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> can be identified and visualized by applying a
          membership cutoff: all genes whose membership is greater
          than the cutoff will be selected as part of the cluster
          and their gene-expression patterns will be displayed.
          Rather than define a single cutoff for each cluster, the
          visualization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">software</ENAMEX> applies a sliding membership
          cutoff to select the genes, allowing each cluster to be
          expanded or collapsed in terms of the number of genes
          selected. This flexibility allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to define the
          appropriate membership cutoff for each cluster. For
          example, at a very high membership cutoff, most of the
          genes in each cluster will have highly correlated
          expression patterns in all of the experiments and will be
          closely related in terms of function and regulation. As
          the membership cutoff decreases, additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be
          assigned to each cluster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>: in many cases, the
          similarity in the expression of the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will
          exist over only a subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments,
          promoting the identification of conditionally coregulated
          genes or genes whose products are more peripherally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the same cellular processes (see below).
          The appropriate membership cutoff will vary for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> and for the desired results, and selecting
          meaningful cutoffs can be guided by additional
          information (see Discussion). For many of the clusters
          discussed below, the membership cutoffs were empirically
          chosen to select genes that had coherent gene expression
          patterns over a given subset of the experiments.
        
        
          Optimization of fuzzy clustering parameters
          
            Clustering cycles
            We found that performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clustering cycles</ENAMEX>,
            with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> performed on subsets
            of the data as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods,
            maximized the recovery of the clusters identified
            through hierarchical clustering. Performing three
            cycles to identify 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> centroids recovered <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>
            of the known clusters in the dataset, compared to the
            case when the clustering was carried out in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> round
            using identical parameters and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed vectors</ENAMEX>, for which
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> of the known clusters were identified (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]).
            Performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> rounds of clustering did not
            identify additional known clusters in the dataset, nor
            did it lead to the increased identification of large
            clusters of coherently expressed genes (data not
            shown). We therefore implemented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of
            clustering, although more sophisticated methods of
            determining the optimal number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> can be
            envisioned.
          
          
            Defining k
            A significant challenge in partitioning-clustering
            techniques is defining the number of clusters, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. With standard
            implementations of the k-means algorithm,
            underestimating 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> will result in large clusters
            of many genes that display divergent gene-expression
            patterns, while overestimating 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> will over-fit the data and
            split groups of similarly expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into
            multiple, small clusters. Because of the dependence of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering on 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , a number of methods have been
            developed to estimate this parameter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. In
            contrast, fuzzy k-means clustering appears to be less
            sensitive to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-fitting, because the genes are not
            forced to belong to only a single cluster. For example,
            performing the clustering with 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only approximately</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> unique centroids relative to when the clustering was
            performed with 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>, and otherwise-identical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]). The relatively small number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centroids</ENAMEX> added when 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> was increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> was
            largely due to the fact that the program identified
            many more replicates of centroids, which were
            consequently removed from the final set. Of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> added centroids, most appeared to
            represent local minima, as they were centroids that
            were poorly reproduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> experiments
            (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods) and identified few genes
            that had coherent patterns of expression (data not
            shown). Nonetheless, the addition of these patterns did
            not significantly affect the relative memberships of
            genes to the other centroids (data not shown),
            indicating that overestimating 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> did not appreciably affect the
            clustering results. This presents a significant
            advantage over standard k-means clustering as it
            reduces the requirement of accurately estimating 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> by allowing this parameter to
            be overestimated.
          
          
            Initialization
            We examined a number of different initialization
            methods (data not shown) and found that seeding
            prototype centroids with the eigen vectors identified
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> performed optimally. Together, the eigen vectors
            describe the variation in the gene-expression dataset,
            and therefore seeding the centroids with these vectors
            provides a systematic method of sampling the data
            space. In addition, this protocol produces
            deterministic clustering results, in contrast to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> initialization method commonly implemented in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> potential drawback of this
            method is that the number of clusters, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , is limited to the number of
            eigen vectors (which is determined by the number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments analyzed). This limitation is
            alleviated by performing successive cycles of fuzzy
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering on subsets of the data and
            recalculating the eigen vectors for the respective
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> used in each cycle. In addition, the clustering
            protocol can incorporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined vectors to seed
            any number of additional centroids.
            Many of the eigen vectors identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> seemed
            to contain little information about the dataset, as
            previously noted for this type of analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>].
            Nonetheless, most of the eigen vectors diverged to
            different gene-expression patterns within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-15</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iterations</ENAMEX>. The final centroids identified by the fuzzy
            clustering method showed little dependence on the eigen
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> used to seed the process, as evidenced by
            bootstrapping analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 50%</NUMEX> of the final
            centroids were identified in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the bootstrapping
            trials in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> was performed on a random sample of
            the data, despite the fact the most of the eigen
            vectors were significantly different in each trial (see
            Materials and methods). Most of the final centroids
            bore little similarity to the eigen vectors used to
            initialize the process, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> of final
            centroids similar to any of the eigen vectors with a
            Pearson correlation greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> context
            Similarly to standard k-means clustering, the
            results of the fuzzy k-means method were affected by
            the data context. This was evident by the fact that the
            recovery of known clusters was enhanced by performing
            successive rounds of clustering on data subsets, as
            described above. In addition, the algorithm performed
            slightly better on an input dataset that consisted of
            the subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genes</ENAMEX> that showed differential
            expression patterns, as opposed to the entire
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression dataset. As the input dataset for the
            clustering process, we empirically selected genes whose
            standard deviation of expression was greater than
            around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4</NUMEX> (log 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 0.45</NUMEX>) from each gene's expression
            mean, amounting to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 4,400</NUMEX> out of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The algorithm performed
            equally well on input datasets selected by other
            criteria of differential expression (data not shown).
            Performing the clustering on data subsets posed no
            limitation to the method, because at the end of the
            procedure all genes in the complete dataset were
            assigned membership values to the superset of
            identified centroids.
          
        
        
          Fuzzy clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> genomic expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>
          
            Fuzzy clustering identified previously
            unrecognized gene clusters
            The fuzzy clustering method was also able to
            identify clusters of genes that were not identified by
            hierarchical or standard k-means clustering. For
            example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> centroid (cluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>, Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5aand</TIMEX> see [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]) represented genes that were strongly repressed in
            response to prolonged nitrogen starvation but induced
            by treatment with the sulfhydryl-rearranging drugs
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dithiothreitol</ENAMEX> (DTT) and diamide. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
            characterized genes within the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are localized to or
            function in relation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX>, including those
            involved in bud growth and cell separation ( 
            AXL2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CIS3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SIM1</TIMEX> ), cell-wall
            proteins induced by antifungal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> ( 
            SVS1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PRY2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PRY4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CRH1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TOS6</TIMEX> ), a
            putative <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-wall sensor ( 
            WSC2 ), and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> mannose
            transporter required for glycosylation of cell-wall
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> ( 
            VRG4 ) (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] for
            references). Given the similarity in the expression of
            these genes, many of the uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may also
            be involved in processes related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX>. In
            fact, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 70%</NUMEX> of all of the genes in this group
            encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> predicted to contain signal peptides
            (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of the twelve characterized genes and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncharacterized genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>;
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> not shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]), supporting the notion that these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are secreted to the cell surface. Extending
            this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the cluster
            identified many more similarly expressed genes that are
            functionally related. In addition to the genes involved
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall biosynthesis</ENAMEX>, which accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of
            the characterized genes selected in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, an
            additional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the characterized genes encode
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein glycosylation</ENAMEX> and
            secretion, while the remaining genes are involved in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, cytoskeletal functions, and sterol
            and lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biogenesis</ENAMEX>, all of which can be related to
            cell-wall and membrane synthesis. Most of the genes
            that had high memberships in this cluster did not fall
            into a discrete cluster when the data were analyzed
            with other clustering algorithms: the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this group were distributed into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
            different clusters when the data were organized by
            hierarchical clustering and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> clusters using k-means
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). This example
            demonstrates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of our method in identifying
            previously unrecognized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of functionally related
            genes.
            In addition to identifying new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of similarly
            expressed genes, fuzzy k-means clustering also provided
            more comprehensive clusters of previously recognized
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of functionally related genes. In many cases,
            these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were similarly expressed in only a subset
            of the experiments, a feature that prevented their
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> when the data were analyzed with the other
            clustering methods. An example of this is a centroid
            that represents <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were strongly induced by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid starvation</ENAMEX> (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>).
            Essentially all of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> characterized genes
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this cluster function in methionine
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> and showed similar expression patterns in
            response to all of the experimental conditions (see [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]). However, as the membership cutoff was decreased
            to expand the cluster, additional functionally related
            genes were included, despite the fact that these genes
            were divergently expressed in response to conditions
            other than amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid limitation</ENAMEX>. Of the characterized
            genes within the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> belonging to this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42/66</NUMEX>) encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are directly
            involved in amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid biosynthesis</ENAMEX>, while more than
            half of the remaining characterized genes are involved
            in aspects of nitrogen and carbon metabolism that
            support amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid synthesis</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only half</NUMEX> of these genes
            fell into the same cluster when the data were analyzed
            with hierarchical clustering or k-means clustering (see
            Materials and methods), while the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> fell
            into multiple smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in both cases.
          
          
            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were assigned to multiple
            clusters
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most significant advantages of fuzzy
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering is that genes can belong to more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, revealing distinct aspects of their
            function and regulation. An illustration is provided by
            the gene 
            KAR2 , which encodes an HSP70
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-folding chaperone localized to the endo-plasmic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reticulum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) that is known to respond to defects in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> secretion and to unfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in this organelle
            (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] for review). Consistent with the known
            functions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, 
            KAR2 has significant membership
            in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>)
            includes genes that were induced by the reducing agent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>, a condition that prevents proper disulfide-bond
            formation and secretion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 75%</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23/31</NUMEX>) of the characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
            genes in this cluster are localized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> and
            participate in various aspects of secretion, including
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folding</ENAMEX> ( 
            KAR2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LHS1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FKB2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JEM1</TIMEX> ), protein
            disulfide isomerization ( 
            EUG1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PDI1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERO1</TIMEX> ), protein
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX> ( 
            GFA1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PMT3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PMI40</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SEC59</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WBP1</TIMEX>,
            OST2 ), and forward and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">retrograde</ENAMEX> trafficking ( 
            ERD2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ERP2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SEC24</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SEC13</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RET2</TIMEX>,
            RET3, and others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]). Many of the
            uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are likely to be
            functionally related to the characterized genes. In
            addition, 
            KAR2 also has significant
            membership in a second cluster (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> in Figure
            5d), which is composed of genes that were induced
            following heat shock and diamide treatment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14/36</NUMEX>) of the top characterized genes associated with
            this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-folding chaperones localized
            to different subcellular regions (including those that
            encode the cytosolic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90 and Hsp70</TIMEX> factors, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mitochondrial Hsp10/Hsp60p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ssc1p</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>- and
            mitochondrial-associated Ssa1p), and their induction
            following heat shock and diamide treatment is likely to
            be in response to widespread protein unfolding
            inflicted by these conditions. That 
            KAR2 clusters with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
            genes reflects the dual role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Kar2p</ENAMEX> in the response
            to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-specific challenges and to conditions that
            generally destabilize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>,
            presumably without affecting other aspects of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX>.
            The clustering of 
            KAR2 with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in these two
            clusters not only reflects the functional role of the
            encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but also corroborates the conditional
            regulation of 
            KAR2 expression. In response to
            defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER secretion</ENAMEX>, 
            KAR2 is known to be induced by
            the transcription factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hac1p</TIMEX> as part of the unfolded
            protein response (UPR) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>]. In fact,
            nearly all of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> were shown
            by Travers 
            et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] to be induced
            following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DTT</ENAMEX> treatment in a manner dependent on Hac1p
            and its upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ire1p</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 29, 30</ENAMEX>].
            However, unlike most of the genes in cluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>, 
            KAR2 is also induced in response
            to heat shock, along with the other chaperone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster 11</ENAMEX>, by the transcription factor Hsf1p [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
            Consistently, most of the top genes in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
            including 
            KAR2 , contain multiple
            Hsf1p-binding sites in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. The clustering
            of 
            KAR2 with both clusters of genes
            therefore reflects the known induction of the gene by
            Hac1p as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX> but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsf1p</TIMEX> following heat
            shock.
            Many additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genes</ENAMEX> have significant
            membership in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> of the fuzzy clusters. When
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were assigned to all clusters with an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empirically</ENAMEX> defined membership cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.06</NUMEX>, more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of the assigned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were placed in more
            than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>); at a slightly lower cutoff of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost two-thirds</NUMEX> of all of the assigned genes
            were placed into multiple clusters. As with 
            KAR2 , the fuzzy assignment of
            many of these genes was consistent with the known roles
            of the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Genes involved in histidine
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> (for example 
            HIS4 and 
            HIS5 ) clustered with other genes
            involved in amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid synthesis</ENAMEX> (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and cluster
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>) but also with genes required for adenine biogenesis
            (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), in agreement with the roles of these gene
            products in both histidine and purine metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>]. Genes that encode <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> vesicle coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ( 
            SEC13, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SEC21</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SEC24</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RET2</TIMEX>,
            RET3 and others) were induced with other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>-specific genes in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX>, as discussed
            above for cluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>, but were also strongly repressed
            following long-term nitrogen and carbon starvation,
            along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of other genes that function in
            diverse aspects of secretion and protein synthesis
            (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>). The repression of these genes coincided
            with the cellular growth arrest resulting from the
            starvation conditions and was likely to be triggered by
            the decreased demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and membrane synthesis
            in nondividing cells. That these genes belong to
            multiple, distinct clusters reflects the
            condition-specific roles of the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
            suggests that their conditional expression with these
            alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes is triggered by different
            cellular signals.
          
          
            Fuzzy clusters represent gene targets of yeast
            transcription factors
            Many of the genes that clustered together by fuzzy
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering are likely to be coregulated at the
            level of transcription in response to certain
            environmental conditions. We explored this possibility
            by characterizing the enrichment of each fuzzy cluster
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that contained known transcription factor
            binding sites within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">800</TIMEX> base-pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) upstream of
            their open reading frames (ORFs). Genes were assigned
            to each cluster using an empirically chosen membership
            cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.08</NUMEX>, and the probability of
            observing the number of genes in each cluster that
            contained one or more copies of each transcription
            factor binding site was calculated, based on the
            hypergeometric distribution (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
            methods). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the identified fuzzy clusters
            were statistically enriched (with 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P <2 × 10 -4</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
            contain copies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> different promoter
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of these clusters were
            enriched for multiple sites (the complete results are
            available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]). In many cases, the presence of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements</ENAMEX> was consistent with the known
            regulation of the genes' expression (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). For
            example, cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was enriched for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that contain
            binding sites for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gcn4p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cbf1p</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">p. Around</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of these genes are known to be induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Gcn4p</TIMEX> in
            response to amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid limitation</ENAMEX> and contain the Gcn4p
            promoter element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. However, those that are
            specifically involved in methionine synthesis also
            contain the recognition sequences for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and/or
            Cbf1p, factors that cooperatively regulate gene
            expression according to the demand for the products of
            this pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37, 38, 39</TIMEX>].
            At a membership cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.08</NUMEX>, cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> consisted
            of many genes involved in the tricarboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> cycle
            and oxidative phosphorylation, and this group was
            enriched for the binding site of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hap2/3/4</NUMEX>p complex
            that is known to regulate the genes' expression. At a
            slightly lower cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.06</NUMEX>, additional genes
            involved in respiration and utilization of alternative
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> were assigned to the cluster, making the
            enrichment of the promoter element recognized by the
            catabolite repressor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mig1p</ENAMEX> statistically significant [
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41, 42</TIMEX>]. At both of these membership cutoffs, this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> was also highly enriched for the sequence
            recognized by the stress-responsive factors Msn2p and
            Msn4p. These factors recognize a sequence that is very
            similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mig1p</NUMEX>-binding site, and it is possible
            that the enriched sequence actually represents
            derivative Mig1p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. However, a specific role for
            Msn2p in the response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose starvation</ENAMEX> has
            recently been identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], raising the possibility
            that the factor is directly involved in regulating
            these genes. Another cluster (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>) consists
            largely of genes that were sharply repressed in
            response to environmental stresses [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 44</ENAMEX>]. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein genes</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are regulated by
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Rap1p</ENAMEX> and contain multiple copies of its
            binding site within their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46</TIMEX>], while
            other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this group contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> putative
            regulatory sequences that have been previously
            identified as enriched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of many of
            these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 47, 48, 49, 50</TIMEX>]. In each of these
            cases, the comprehensive clusters identified by the
            fuzzy k-means analysis included additional genes that
            were not previously known to be targets of these
            factors. Some of the binding-site occurrences shown in
            Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6are</TIMEX> likely to have occurred by chance
            (especially for sequences that are common in the
            genome, such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hap2/3/4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p-</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mig1p-</ENAMEX>, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX>-binding sites). However, the similarity
            between the expression patterns of these genes and
            those of the known transcription factor targets, along
            with the functional correlation of the gene products
            and the presence of the respective binding sites in the
            genes' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, strongly suggest that many of these
            genes are legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>.
            The overlapping clusters identified by fuzzy k-means
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clustering</ENAMEX> presented more complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
            transcription factor targets compared to other
            clustering methods, enhancing the identification of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements enriched</ENAMEX> in the clusters and
            implicating details of the conditional regulation of
            gene expression. An example can be seen in a set of
            around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yap1p</TIMEX> in response
            to oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, but by the general stress factors
            Msn2p and/or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Msn4p</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX>) in response to other
            stressful conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. These genes belonged
            significantly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different clusters (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
            One cluster (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 90</NUMEX> known
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX> targets and was enriched for genes whose
            promoters contain the known <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX>-binding site as
            well as other C-rich sequences that are similar to, but
            distinct from, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX> site (see below). The
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> cluster that these genes belonged to (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
            comprised known Yap1p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">targets</ENAMEX>, most of which contain
            the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Yap1p</NUMEX>-binding site within their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. The
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cluster (cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) specifically represented the
            subgroup of genes that are conditionally regulated by
            Yap1p or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX>, and this group was enriched for
            both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Yap1p</TIMEX> element and the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX>-binding site
            (but not other C-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>). At a lower membership
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cutoff</ENAMEX>, additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were assigned to cluster 8
            that showed similar expression patterns and contain
            both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Yap1p</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements</ENAMEX>,
            suggesting that these genes may also be conditionally
            regulated by the factors. In contrast to these results,
            when the data were analyzed by k-means clustering,
            these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> could only be assigned to a cluster of
            Yap1p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> or a cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX> targets, and
            therefore no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes that was statistically
            enriched for both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements</ENAMEX> could be
            identified (data not shown).
            The majority of the clusters identified by fuzzy
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering were not statistically enriched for
            known transcription factor binding sites. To identify
            novel enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX>, we calculated the
            hypergeometric distribution of all possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the genes clustered by
            fuzzy k-means clustering. Almost all the statistically
            significant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mers represented known transcription
            factor binding sites, with the exception of a group of
            C-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> with high statistical enrichment in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2/Msn4p</ENAMEX> targets in cluster 7
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). We therefore focused our attention on the
            newly identified group of cell-wall genes, defined as
            the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>. Although none of the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mers met the significance cutoff for this cluster (P
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 10 -6</ENAMEX>), the most significant sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGCGAA</ENAMEX>, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -5</NUMEX>) was identical to the
            core binding site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBF</ENAMEX>, a transcription factor
            complex that regulates cell-cycle-dependent gene
            expression at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G1</TIMEX> to S transition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51, 52, 53</TIMEX>]. In
            fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two-thirds</NUMEX> of these genes were
            identified by Iyer 
            et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] as part of a larger
            set of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 180</NUMEX> genes whose flanking regions were
            physically bound by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. However, this set
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was not coordinately expressed during
            cell-cycle progression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55</TIMEX>], suggesting that these
            cell-wall genes may be regulated by a distinct
            mechanism in response to environmental conditions.
            To try and identify novel sequences conserved in
            these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, we used the motif-finding algorithm
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>], initializing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> algorithm with the most
            significantly enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">6mer</ENAMEX> for the cluster. Two
            sequences were repeatedly identified using a variety of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>): <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> motif was very similar to,
            but extended from, the known SBF-binding site and was
            present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, often in multiple
            copies. This represents a significant enrichment over
            the entire set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, of which
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 30%</NUMEX> contain the site. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Nearly 90%</NUMEX> of the
            promoter regions that contain this motif were shown to
            be physically bound by the SBF complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>],
            consistent with the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBF</ENAMEX> binds this sequence.
            These details raise the possibility that SBF
            coordinates the expression of this set of cell-wall
            genes in response to conditions other than cell-cycle
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>], perhaps in a manner that is
            specifically dependent on the variant site identified
            here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> also identified another sequence that has
            not previously been implicated in gene-expression
            regulation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 55%</NUMEX> of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
            genes in cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> harbor the motif in their
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoters</ENAMEX>, in contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 16%</NUMEX> of all yeast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. The precise roles of these sequences in
            mediating gene expression will require further
            experiments; however our ability to identify novel
            sequences conserved in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> highlights the
            potential for discovering additional regulatory
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> by fuzzy k-means clustering.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fuzzy clustering</ENAMEX> uncovered correlations between
            the environmental conditions
            As well as understanding the similarities between
            genes based on their expression patterns, it is also
            enlightening to correlate the experimental conditions
            in terms of their effects on gene expression. These
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlations</ENAMEX> can implicate common features of the
            environments while pointing to the regulatory systems
            that are activated in each situation. A convenient
            feature of the fuzzy-clustering output is that the
            experiments can be hierarchically clustered, on the
            basis of the expression patterns of each selected
            subset of genes, to reveal similarities in the effects
            of the conditions. Performing the clustering based on
            subsets of genes presents subtle correlations between
            the experiments that cannot be realized when the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> is based on all the genes in the dataset.
            For example, when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> microarray experiments
            analyzed in this study were hierarchically clustered on
            the basis of the expression patterns of all the genes
            in the dataset, the experiments largely clustered
            according to the individual time courses (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8a</NUMEX>).
            This reveals that the overall genomic expression
            program triggered by each environment was unique to
            each set of conditions.
            However, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments were
            clustered on the basis of subsets of genes identified
            by fuzzy k-means clustering, more detailed correlations
            emerged, indicating more information about the effects
            of each environment. An example is the
            sulfhydryl-oxidizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diamide</ENAMEX>, which affects many
            aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell biochemistry</ENAMEX>. When the experiment
            clustering was performed on the basis of genes encoding
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-folding chaperones</ENAMEX> (the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cluster
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>), a striking similarity between the effects of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diamide</ENAMEX> and heat shock was observed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8b</NUMEX>). In
            contrast, when the microarray clustering was performed
            on the basis of genes involved in oxidative stress
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX>, (the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> belonging to cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
            diamide was most similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> and
            menadione, which inflict oxidative damage by generating
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive oxygen species</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8c</NUMEX>). In terms of the
            genes induced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX> (identified as the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
            genes or so in cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>), the effects of diamide were
            most similar to those triggered by the reducing agent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8d</NUMEX>). That the effects of diamide were
            similar to those of different environmental conditions
            depending on the genes analyzed reflects the diverse
            effects of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8f</NUMEX>). By
            crosslinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sulfhydryl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, diamide is
            thought to disrupt protein structure and trigger
            oxidative stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58</TIMEX>], both of which are likely to
            perturb normal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>].
            The similarities between other environmental
            conditions are less well understood. For example,
            limitation of the essential nutrient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> triggered
            diverse gene-expression changes in the cell [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
            Although the overall genomic expression program
            triggered by this condition was distinct, when the
            experiment clustering was based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
            the use of alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and respiration
            (cluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> and cluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>, respectively), a
            significant similarity between the effects of zinc
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX> and conditions that involve glucose
            starvation emerged (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8e</NUMEX>). Like carbon starvation,
            zinc limitation triggered the increased expression of
            these genes, even though the cells were not limited for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Lyons</ENAMEX>, personal communication). This result
            suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-limited cells may have a defect in
            glucose metabolism, leading to the induced expression
            of the respiration and carbon-utilization genes. While
            a link between zinc limitation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> metabolism has
            been established in mammals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>], the molecular basis
            of this correlation is not known. In contrast to this
            relationship, when the experiment clustering was
            performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding ER-resident proteins</ENAMEX>, the
            effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc starvation</ENAMEX> were most similar to those
            inflicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> and diamide (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8d</NUMEX>), suggesting
            that zinc limitation may initiate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX>. Zinc
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starvation</ENAMEX> is not known to induce this program in yeast
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Patil</ENAMEX>, personal communication). However, a
            potential connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX> is the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein calreticulin</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ER protein</ENAMEX>-folding chaperone
            that acts on glycosylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. That
            mammalian calreticulin is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc-dependent protein</ENAMEX> [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>] raises the possibility that zinc limitation
            prevents the proper activity of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
            leading to unfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and triggering the
            subtle increase in expression of genes that participate
            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPR</ENAMEX>. The correlations between the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes triggered by these conditions
            suggest hypotheses about the effects of each condition
            that warrant future experiments.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        To respond to diverse and frequently changing
        environmental conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> must precisely
        mediate the synthesis and function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
        cell. This is controlled in part by the overall genomic
        expression program that results from the combined action of
        different regulatory factors, each of which responds to
        specific extra- and intra-cellular signals. Many of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> act under specific conditions, and together they
        govern the expression of overlapping sets of genes.
        Individual genes, in turn, are regulated by multiple,
        condition-specific systems that result in each gene being
        coexpressed with different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> under different
        situations.
        Although examples of this type of regulation have been
        observed on an individual gene basis, our results suggest
        that the condition-specific regulation of overlapping sets
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genes</ENAMEX> is a prevalent theme in the regulation of
        yeast gene expression. A large fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genes</ENAMEX> is
        expressed in patterns that are similar to different groups
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in response to different subsets of the
        experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, a substantial number of
        these genes contain multiple transcription factor binding
        sites in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, and see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]),
        consistent with the idea that they are conditionally
        regulated by multiple, independent regulatory systems. The
        condition-specific regulation of gene expression has also
        been implicated in higher organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63, 64</TIMEX>] and probably
        has a significant role in regulating genomic expression.
        This is in contrast to the regulatory logic of prokaryotes,
        in which the expression of defined sets of genes in operons
        is a predominant feature of regulation. Thus, the
        conditional regulation of overlapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may
        represent a regulatory theme that is particularly important
        in eukaryotes.
        The prevalence of conditional gene coexpression poses a
        challenge for the analysis of gene-expression data, because
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will have expression patterns that are similar
        to multiple, distinct gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Fuzzy k-means clustering
        is well suited to identifying conditionally coexpressed
        genes for a number of reasons. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> and foremost, the
        method can present overlapping clusters, revealing distinct
        features of each gene's function and regulation. The
        resulting implications can be used to assign refined
        hypothetical functions to uncharacterized gene products on
        the basis of the known functions encoded by the genes in
        each cluster. In addition, this information can suggest
        additional cellular roles of well studied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]). The overlapping clusters identified by fuzzy k-means
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> also present more comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conditionally coregulated genes</ENAMEX>. This is especially
        important for the successful identification of regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motifs</ENAMEX> common to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of similarly expressed
        genes, because motif-finding algorithms are often hindered
        by small sample sets. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than two-thirds</NUMEX> of the gene
        clusters we identified are not enriched for known
        regulatory elements, highlighting the potential for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discovering</ENAMEX> novel sequences involved in gene-expression
        regulation. We expect that fuzzy k-means clustering will
        advance that discovery, as illustrated by our ability to
        identify new sequences conserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of
        clustered genes.
        Another benefit of the fuzzy k-means algorithm is that
        it identifies continuous clusters of genes. This allows
        each cluster to be expanded or collapsed to view genes of
        varying similarity in expression. While the genes of
        highest membership in a given cluster are often tightly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> in terms of biochemical function and regulation,
        expanding the cluster can identify genes that are similarly
        expressed in only subsets of the experimental conditions.
        The resulting gene relationships can suggest details about
        the cellular roles served by the encoded gene products and
        the regulatory systems that govern the genes' expression in
        response to the relevant conditions. Thus, the results of
        fuzzy k-means clustering are naturally suited for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> to use in an intuitive and physiologically
        meaningful way.
        The unique features of fuzzy k-means clustering have
        allowed us to uncover complex similarities in yeast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns, identify putative transcription
        factor binding sites present in the genes' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, and
        elucidate the environmental conditions that trigger changes
        in gene expression. Integrating these details can indicate
        the cellular signals and regulatory systems that govern the
        expression of specific sets of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
        For example, the fuzzy clustering of genes involved in
        methionine biosynthesis with other amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> biosynthetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in nitrogen utilization lead
        to the identification of multiple transcription factor
        binding sites in the genes' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. Together, these
        details reflect the alternative regulatory systems that are
        known to govern the expression of the methionine
        biosynthesis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Although they are induced by one
        regulatory system (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cbf1p-Met31/32</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>) according to the demand
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX>'s products, they are induced by an
        alternative system (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Gcn4p</NUMEX>) in response to a general signal
        of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid starvation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35, 65</TIMEX>], and they are
        probably also regulated by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> mechanism (GATA factors)
        in response to the available nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Combining
        this information with similar indications for other sets of
        genes gives a summary of the details discussed in this
        study and suggests a model for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the
        regulatory system that controls gene expression in yeast
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). The overlapping nature of the sets of
        coregulated genes supports the ability of the cell to
        customize the emergent genomic expression program to the
        particular needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, while minimizing the number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> required to produce each genomic expression
        program.
        The fuzzy k-means algorithm used here was chosen for its
        conceptual and algorithmic simplicity. There are many
        alternative algorithms that might accomplish the same ends.
        For example, Ihmels 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] have applied a heuristic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> to the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast gene</ENAMEX>-expression data to
        identify overlapping sets of genes whose expression is
        similar to known gene-expression patterns. This method
        produced interesting results and identified genes that were
        similarly expressed to known transcription factor targets.
        A key difference between these algorithms is that fuzzy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering requires no 
        a priori information about the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>. Thus, each method may be suitable for a different
        biological question, namely identifying genes whose
        expression is similar to known or expected gene expression
        patterns versus an unbiased, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de novo</ENAMEX> exploration of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression dataset.
        Despite the advantages of fuzzy k-means clustering
        discussed above, the method also has a number of
        limitations. Most notably, the assignment of genes to the
        clusters requires a user-defined membership cutoff. While
        this allows complete flexibility in data exploration,
        selecting meaningful cutoffs is a challenge. Choice of
        cutoff can be guided by a number of criteria, including the
        coherence of the selected gene-expression patterns, the
        functional relationships of the characterized genes
        selected, or the statistical enrichment of sequences in the
        selected genes' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. We have attempted to alleviate
        the challenge of selecting cutoffs by providing
        visualization software specifically designed for the fuzzy
        clustering results, allowing the gene expression data to be
        inspected directly and dynamically.
        Although the fuzzy k-means clustering method
        successfully identified <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 90%</NUMEX> of the known clusters in
        the dataset, it routinely failed to identify a small number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that were identified by hierarchical clustering.
        The inability of the method to find the expression patterns
        representing these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> seemed to be dependent on the
        overall properties of the dataset, rather than the absence
        of an appropriate eigen vector used to initiate the
        process, as the program was unable to identify these
        patterns even when the process was initiated by seeding the
        centroids with the unidentified patterns (data not shown).
        We have accounted for this limitation by allowing any
        number of expression patterns to be added to the final list
        of identified cluster centroids, thereby revealing genes
        that are similarly expressed to the pattern in
        question.
        Despite these limitations, the unique advantages of
        fuzzy k-means clustering make the technique a valuable tool
        for gene-expression analysis. We believe that fuzzy k-means
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> will be a useful complement to other
        computational methods commonly used to analyze
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data. Whereas algorithms that present
        discrete gene clusters provide a straightforward method of
        initial data exploration, the flexibility of fuzzy k-means
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> can be used to reveal more complex correlations
        between gene-expression patterns, promoting refined
        hypotheses of the role and regulation of gene-expression
        changes.

          Dataset
          Published genomic expression data of wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae responding to zinc
          starvation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], phosphate limitation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-</ENAMEX>damaging
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], and a variety of stressful environmental
          changes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] were combined into a dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,153</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> microarray experiments (dataset A). These data
          were chosen because the experiments were performed using
          the same experimental and microarray methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> Microarray
          Database and were otherwise unprocessed before
          clustering, with the exception of the heat shock, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>-source experiments, which were transformed as
          previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The complete dataset organized
          by hierarchical clustering can be downloaded from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          A subset of this data was used in the fuzzy k-means
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> and consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,373</NUMEX> genes whose standard
          deviation in expression was log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.45</NUMEX>) from each vector mean
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dataset</TIMEX> B), identified using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">program Cluster</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Similarity metric
          For all methods discussed, the weighted, uncentered
          Pearson correlation was used as the similarity metric
          (referred to simply as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
          Where noted, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> distance was used, equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -
          correlation. The array weights used in the calculation
          were generated as previously described, using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX>
          correlation cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> and an exponent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1</NUMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]
          for details).
        
        
          Hierarchical clustering
          Average linkage hierarchical clustering of the data
          was carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">program Cluster</ENAMEX> as previously
          described, using the weighted, uncentered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX>
          correlation as the similarity metric [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Dataset A</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> B were hierarchically clustered with identical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, using array weights calculated based on a
          correlation cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> and an exponent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>].
          Clustering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments was carried out
          similarly, using gene weights calculated with a
          correlation cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> and an exponent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          To represent all the significant gene clusters
          identified by hierarchical clustering, the dendrogram
          generated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dataset</TIMEX> B by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> program was
          parsed, and the average expression patterns of clusters
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with an average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX>
          correlation <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>0.7</NUMEX> were calculated. Through this method,
          38 hierarchical cluster means were identified. The
          parsing process was repeated to calculate the average
          expression patterns of clusters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          with average correlations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>0.8 and >0.9</NUMEX>. Cluster
          means not already represented in the initial group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          clusters were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, resulting in a total of
          53 hierarchical cluster means identified for the dataset.
          The centroids identified through fuzzy k-means clustering
          were considered similar to the hierarchical cluster means
          if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation between the vectors was
          ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Fuzzy k-means clustering
          We implemented the modified fuzzy k-means method in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C++</ENAMEX> program <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FuzzyK</ENAMEX>, available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          The fuzzy k-means algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] is based on the
          minimization of the objective function shown below, for a
          given fuzzy partition of the data, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, and a set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K cluster</ENAMEX> centroids, V
          
          where 
          X 
          
            i 
           is the expression pattern of the 
          i th gene in the dataset, 
          V 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           is the centroid of the

           , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the number of genes in the
          dataset, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> is the total number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>.
          We implemented the algorithm to perform three
          successive cycles of fuzzy k-means clustering. The first
          cycle of clustering was initialized by performing PCA on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> B using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNU Scientific Library SVD</ENAMEX> function.
          Of the top 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/3</NUMEX> eigen vectors, those to which
          no gene had a maximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation were eliminated
          (for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> eigen vector was
          eliminated in each cycle). The remaining eigen vectors
          were used as prototype centroids for that clustering
          cycle. Subsequent cycles of clustering were initialized
          similarly, except that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> was performed on the
          respective data subset used in that clustering cycle.
          During the centroid refinement in each clustering
          cycle, new centroids were calculated on the basis of the
          weighted mean of all the gene-expression patterns in the
          dataset according to
          
          where each gene's membership 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (a continuous variable from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was defined as
          
          and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> was the gene weight: in the first
          clustering cycle, the gene weights used were those
          defined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">program Cluster</ENAMEX>, using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson</ENAMEX>
          correlation cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> and an exponent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>] and
          in subsequent cycles the gene weight was empirically
          defined as
          
          where 
          d 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xi</ENAMEX>, Vj 
           is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> distance between gene 
          X 
          
            i 
           , and vector 
          V 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           , 
          c 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xi</ENAMEX>, Xn 
           is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation between genes 
          X 
          
            i 
           and 
          X 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           , and 
          x is the correlation cutoff, in
          this case <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX>. This weighting scheme served to overweight
          genes that were correlated to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX>.
          In each clustering cycle, the centroids were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iteratively</ENAMEX> refined until the average change in gene
          memberships between iterations was <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 40-60</NUMEX> total iterations in each clustering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cycle</ENAMEX>). While <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 85%</NUMEX> of the centroids stabilized
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 15 iterations</TIMEX>, some of the centroids
          required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40</NUMEX> iterations before stabilizing.
          After each clustering cycle, the centroids were
          combined with those identified in previous cycles, and
          replicate centroids were averaged: each centroid was
          compared to all other centroids in the set, and centroid
          pairs correlated ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX> were replaced by the average of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors. The new vector was compared to the
          remaining centroids in the set and averaged with those to
          which it was correlated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>0.9</NUMEX>. This process continued
          until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each centroid</TIMEX> (or the vector that replaced it) was
          compared to all other existing centroids in the set.
          Following the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clustering cycles</ENAMEX>, data
          subsets were selected to apply to subsequent rounds of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX>. Genes that were correlated to any existing
          centroid with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson correlation >0.7</ENAMEX> were removed
          from the dataset, and array and gene weights were
          recalculated on the data subset as described above. The
          new data subset was applied to a subsequent cycle of
          clustering, performed as described above.
        
        
          Final gene-cluster assignments
          The centroids identified through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rounds of fuzzy
          clustering were combined into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set and replicate
          centroids were averaged, as described above. Each gene in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dataset A</ENAMEX> was assigned a membership score to each of the
          unique centroids. For display in the figures, the final
          list of centroids was ordered by hierarchical clustering.
          Genes were selected in each cluster if their membership
          score was greater than the empirically determined
          membership cutoff applied to each cluster. For display in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the genes selected in each cluster were
          subsequently organized by hierarchical clustering.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering
          For an optimal comparison of the results of k-means
          and fuzzy k-means clustering, we performed the k-means
          clustering identically to the fuzzy k-means protocol,
          except that during the clustering iterations each gene
          contributed only to the cluster to which it was most
          similar (with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> rounds of hard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>-means clustering were performed with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>, and each cycle was
          initiated by seeding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/3</NUMEX> centroids with the most
          informative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/3</NUMEX> eigen vectors identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, as described above. The process for merging
          centroids, selecting the data subsets for subsequent
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">clustering</TIMEX> rounds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and array weighting were
          carried out identically as described for fuzzy k-means
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX>. After identification of the final set of
          centroids, each gene was assigned only to the centroid to
          which it was most similar.
        
        
          Bootstrapping
          To estimate the dependence of the procedure on the
          initial dataset, a bootstrapping method was applied in
          which the fuzzy k-means protocol was repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times,
          each time on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,373</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> chosen randomly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dataset</TIMEX> B,
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX>. The occurrence of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centroid</ENAMEX> in the bootstrap trials was determined by
          summing the number of trials that contained a centroid
          that was correlated ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX> to the centroid in question.
          By this criterion, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 50%</NUMEX> of the centroids were
          identified in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the trials, while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25%</NUMEX>
          of the centroids were identified in all of the
          trials.
          To estimate the dependence of the procedure on the
          eigen vectors used to seed the clusters, a similar
          bootstrapping procedure was carried out in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> was
          performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,373</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> chosen randomly from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dataset</TIMEX> B
          but the cluster refinement was done using all genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dataset B.</ENAMEX> The frequency of each centroid was scored as
          described above. The results were similar to the previous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bootstrapping</ENAMEX> experiment, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 50%</NUMEX> of the
          centroids present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the bootstrapping trials, and
          around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the centroids identified in all the
          trials.
        
        
          Promoter analysis
          Genes were assigned to all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91</TIMEX> identified centroids
          on the basis of a membership cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.08</NUMEX>. The
          statistical enrichment of each cluster for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
          contained known transcription factor binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or
          different <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mer sequences within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">800 bp</NUMEX> upstream of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> was assessed, according to the hypergeometric
          distribution. The probability of observing at least 
          q genes that contained one or more
          copies of a given sequence out of 
          l genes in a fuzzy cluster was
          calculated as
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> is the number of genes in the
          genome that contain the motif and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is the total number of genes in
          the genome. Forty-three transcription factor binding
          sites were compiled from the literature (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] for a
          complete list of sequences). The enrichment of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> was considered significant if the 
          P value was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX> divided by the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> searched, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -4for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 43</TIMEX>
          transcription factor binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 × 10 -6for</NUMEX> the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,096</NUMEX> different <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mers.
          The program MEME [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>] was seeded with the most
          significant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mer (CGCGAA) enriched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> selected for cluster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>, and the program was
          run with a variety of parameters (the parameters and MEME
          output can be found at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]). Genes whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          contained significant matches to the identified matrices
          were identified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patser</ENAMEX> on the RSA tools website [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68, 69</TIMEX>].
