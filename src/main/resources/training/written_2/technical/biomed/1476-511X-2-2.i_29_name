        Sickle cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (SCD) is the most common genetic
        disorder in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and it
        is associated with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality in
        affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> exhibit
        impaired growth [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] as well as delayed skeletal and
        sexual maturation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The underlying cause of growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> has not been confirmed but has been
        attributed to several factors such as increased resting
        metabolic rate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and deficiencies of various nutrient
        including folate, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>, vitamin A, vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> and iron [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        In a previous study of the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of the
        serum phospholipids of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> and healthy
        controls that we conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , we found that
        the serum phospholipids of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls had
        comparable levels of linoleic and α-linolenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>.
        However, the percentages of the long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> polyunsaturated
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> derived from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> essential fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        were significantly decreased whereas the proportions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saturated fatty acids</ENAMEX>, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oleic acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">palmitic acid</ENAMEX>,
        were significantly increased. Similar alterations in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> total phospholipid composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with SCD
        have been reported by others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> composition of serum phospholipids is
        known to reflect the phospholipid composition of cell
        membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Because the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of
        membrane phospholipids is a major determinant of membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluidity</ENAMEX> and function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , any alteration in fatty acid
        composition of membrane phospholipids could contribute to
        the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> abnormalities seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>, such as cation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imbalance</ENAMEX>, dehydration, reduced deformability and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercoagulability</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Phase angle is a bioelectrical impedance parameter
        derived from the measured impedance parameters, resistance
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) and reactance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xc</ENAMEX>). Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R</ENAMEX> is related to the
        magnitude of the lean body mass, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xc</ENAMEX> reflects the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capacitance</ENAMEX> produced by cell membranes and tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interfaces</ENAMEX>. This capacitance causes the current to lag the
        voltage, creating a phase shift. Phase angle is regarded as
        an indicator of cellular health and membrane integrity, a
        low phase angle being indicative of a deterioration in the
        integrity or function of cell membranes. Phase angle has
        been shown to be a reliable predictor of outcome in a
        variety of clinical conditions where alterations in cell
        membranes are known to occur, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] ,
        trauma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        .
        In a recent study of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nigerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>, we
        determined the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX> and correlated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> proportions with
        the phase angle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The percentage of palmitic acid
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oleic acid</ENAMEX> correlated inversely with phase angle,
        whereas, in contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">n-3 series</ENAMEX> (eicosapentaenoic, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20:5n</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>;
        docosapentaenoic, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22:5n</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; and docosahexaenoic, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6n-3</ENAMEX>)
        were positively correlated with phase angle. If serum
        phospholipids are truly surrogates for membrane
        phospholipids, as is widely believed, then the correlations
        we observed between specific fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and phase angle
        should apply to the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of tissue membrane
        phospholipids as well.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol</ENAMEX> and phospholipids are the major lipid
        components of cell membranes and the major determinants of
        membrane fluidity and function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In the present
        study, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> content and the fatty acid
        composition of red cell membranes as surrogates for tissue
        membranes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> and healthy controls, we
        found significant correlations between phase angle with
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and the proportions of specific n-3
        polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> in the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> phospholipids
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Sample collection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> was obtained by venipuncture and collected into
          vacutainer tubes containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EDTA</ENAMEX> as the anticoagulant.
          After centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> × g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, the plasma
          fraction was removed. The red blood cells were washed
          twice with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) NaCl to remove plasma, platelets
          and leukocytes and then resuspended in saline. The red
          blood cell suspension was then aliquoted into cryovials
          and frozen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-40°C</TIMEX> until transported in the frozen state
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Mexico School of Medicine</ENAMEX> for
          analysis.
        
        
          Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> analysis of red cell
          phospholipids
          Briefly, the total lipids in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> ml of red blood
          cells were extracted into chloroform: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v/v</ENAMEX>). The extract was evaporated under a stream of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX>, redissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml chloroform, and loaded
          onto a silicic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> column which had previously been
          prepared and washed with chloroform. Neutral lipids were
          eluted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml chloroform. Total phospholipids were
          eluted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ml chloroform: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2:1, v/v</ENAMEX>). The
          eluate was again dried under a stream of nitrogen and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redissolved</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) BF 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>. Preparation of fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid methyl esters</ENAMEX> was carried out as previously
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrison</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The methylation
          reaction was carried out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min. Fatty acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl esters</ENAMEX> were quantitated using a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.53 mm × 15</NUMEX> m
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused silica Megabore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DB-225</ENAMEX> column (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folsom</ENAMEX>,
          CA) in a gas chromatograph (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">model 5890</TIMEX>)
          equipped with an integrator. Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were identified
          by comparison of their retention times to those of fatty
          acid standards (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supelco, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bellefonte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) and
          results were expressed as weight percent of total fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Cholesterol analysis of red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol</ENAMEX> was extracted from the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> suspension
          as follows. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> ml of red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> suspension was extracted
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chloroform</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, v/v</ENAMEX>) and the
          total lipids reconstituted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml chloroform. To a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          μl aliquot of the total lipid extract <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> μl potassium hydroxide solution (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> by weight) were
          added. The mixture also contained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">107 μg</NUMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-α-cholestane (internal standard). The mixture was
          heated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>. Following saponification,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml hexane were added to the mixture.
          After mixing and centrifugation, the upper hexane layer
          was removed and transferred to a clean test tube and the
          aqueous layer was extracted twice more with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hexane</ENAMEX>. The combined hexane layers were evaporated to
          dryness under a stream of nitrogen and the extracted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> was dissolved in hexane for gas
          chromatographic analysis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cholesterol</ENAMEX> was analyzed using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> gas
          liquid chromatograph (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">model 5890</TIMEX>) equipped with a flame
          ionization detector and a fused-silica capillary column
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAC-5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 m × 0.25 mm</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supelco, Bellefonte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) and
          helium carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. The injector and detector temperature
          were at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300°C</TIMEX>. The initial column temperature of 285°C
          was maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> and then increased to 290°C
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">min</ENAMEX> and held at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">290°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. Cholesterol
          content was expressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mg</ENAMEX>/ml red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> suspension volume
          and then normalized to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Determination of red cell phosphorus
          All glassware used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX> analysis was rinsed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrochloric acid</ENAMEX> and deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> ml of
          washed red blood cells was extracted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ml of
          chloroform:<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2:1, v/v</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> at room
          temperature. After addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ml of saline solution,
          the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> rpm for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> to obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phases. The chloroform layer was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filtered</ENAMEX> and then evaporated under a stream of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX>.
          Concentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfuric acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 ml</NUMEX>) was added to the
          tubes containing the extracted phospholipids and the
          samples were heated in a sand bath for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250°C</TIMEX>.
          After the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">perchloric acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.15 ml</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>), the
          samples were heated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional 30 min</TIMEX>,
          mixing occasionally. After cooling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX> ml of an aqueous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium molybdate solution</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> by weight) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> ml of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiske-Subbarow</ENAMEX> reagent were added and the samples were
          then placed in a boiling water bath for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min. The
          absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">820</NUMEX> nm was measured and the phosphorus
          concentration determined using a phosphorus standard
          curve constructed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disodium hydrogen phosphate</ENAMEX>
          (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 to 20.0 μg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Bioelectrical impedance analysis
          Impedance analysis was performed using a BIA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>
          impedance analyzer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJL Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton Township</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>). The
          instrument delivers an alternating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> μamp current at a
          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kHz. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were requested to void
          before measurements were made. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> laid in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supine</ENAMEX> position on a nonconducting surface with limbs
          abducted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30°</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX>-introducing electrodes were placed on the first
          joint of the middle finger and just below the middle toe.
          The detecting electrodes were placed with the upper edge
          of the electrode bisecting the ulnar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the wrist
          and the median malleolus of the foot. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> was taken to
          ensure that the signal and detecting electrodes were not
          closer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cm. Duplicate measurements of resistance
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) and reactance (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          c ) were made on each subject. Phase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angle</ENAMEX> was calculated as the arctan <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> 
          c /<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and is expressed in degrees.
        
        
          Calculation of mean melting point (MMP) of red cell
          membrane phospholipid
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> was determined by as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jensen</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patton</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . First, the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">mol%</NUMEX> of each fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was
          calculated by dividing the mass<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of each fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> by
          its respective molecular weight. Next, we multiplied the
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">mol%</NUMEX> by the (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MP +100</ENAMEX>) of each fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to obtain the
          melting point fractions. Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP fractions</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">summed and 100</ENAMEX> was subtracted from that sum to provide
          the estimate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> of the acyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of the
          phospholipid preparation. The melting points used for the
          fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C14:0</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54°C</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C15</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">52°C</NUMEX>),

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-44°C</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Statistical analysis was performed with the aid of

          Comments on the study population
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, the mean age of the male SCD
          subjects was not significantly different than the mean
          age of the male controls. The female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          also matched for age with the controls. No significant
          differences in any of the body composition parameters
          such as weight, height, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFM</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BF</ENAMEX> were observed between
          either the male or female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and their respective
          controls. The only exception was the phase angle for
          which there were significant differences between controls
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> profiles of red cell
          phospholipids
          Because no differences were found in the fatty acid
          proportions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female controls and between
          male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> data for
          male and female control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were pooled and the data
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were combined. As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> phospholipids of the SCD
          subjects contained significantly higher proportions of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major saturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, palmitic acid
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C16:0</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stearic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C18:0</ENAMEX>), than the controls. The
          monounsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids oleic acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1n-9</ENAMEX>) and
          vaccenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1n-7</ENAMEX>) were also significantly elevated
          in the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> membrane phospholipids of the SCD
          subjects.
          With regard to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">n-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of polyunsaturated fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, only α <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linoleic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C18:2n-6</ENAMEX>) and arachidonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C20:4n-6</ENAMEX>) were significantly reduced in the
          membrane phospholipids of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> compared to
          controls. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">n-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of polyunsaturated fatty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, the long chain polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> derived
          from α-linolenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C18:3n-3</ENAMEX>), namely eicosapentaenoic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C20:5n-3</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">docosahexaenoic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C22:6n-3</ENAMEX>), were
          significantly reduced in the membrane phospholipids of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Overall, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had increased
          proportions of saturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in their red cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX> and significantly decreased proportions of
          polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mean Melting Point</ENAMEX> (MMP) of red cell
          phospholipids
          The finding of higher proportions of the high melting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saturated fatty acids</ENAMEX> and lesser amounts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PUFA</ENAMEX> with
          lower melting points in the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> phospholipids of the
          SCD subjects relative to the controls prompted us to
          asses the overall impact of these differences on the
          relative fluidity of the acyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of the phospholipids
          from the red cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the controls
          by estimating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> of the phospholipids using the
          approach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jensen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patton</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The calculated MMP
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> was significantly higher than for the
          controls, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29°C</TIMEX> vs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">24°C</ENAMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>. The estimated MMP
          of the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell phospholipids</ENAMEX> was also inversely
          correlated with phase angle as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =

          be significantly different between the phospholipids of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls, only palmitic acid
          exhibited a significant inverse correlation with phase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>). A negative correlation with phase angle
          was also seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oleic acid</ENAMEX>, the major monounsaturated

          only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linoleic acid</ENAMEX> was significantly correlated with
          phase angle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.012</NUMEX>).
          No significant relations were found between phase

          obtained (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>,).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fat-free</ENAMEX> mass (FFM), the major determinant of phase

        Discussion
        The results of the present study confirm our hypothesis,
        based on analyses of serum phospholipids conducted in two
        previous studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 21</ENAMEX> ] ,
        that red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> phospholipids of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> contain
        significantly lower proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> polyunsaturated
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and higher proportions of saturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        relative to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> controls. These results are in
        agreement with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connor</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] who
        found similar alterations in the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of
        the red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> phospholipids of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>. The
        red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the present study also
        contained significantly higher amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>. More
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, in the present study we found that both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> content and the percentage of several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the red cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were significantly
        correlated with phase angle. Overall, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        we studied, cell membrane components that are known to
        decrease membrane fluidity, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saturated fatty acids</ENAMEX>, were associated with a low phase
        angle while those which increase fluidity, such as
        long-chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids</ENAMEX>, were associated
        with a high phase angle.
        The altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid composition</ENAMEX> in both the serum and
        red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> phospholipids of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> we studied may
        be due to several causes. These include: differences in
        dietary intake between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls,
        aberrations of the desaturase-elongase pathway that
        interconverts <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>, and increased metabolism (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-oxidation</NUMEX>) of the
        long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>. Although we
        did not obtain dietary information for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in this
        study, we assumed that the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> containing
        the essential and long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> did not differ
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls. However, the SCD
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> may have been consuming less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, on average,
        than the controls.
        With regard to the metabolism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> mentioned
        above, the activities of the enzymes that are responsible
        for the elongation and desaturation of the essential fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> to produce the long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        may vary between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and controls. In a study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-energy <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decsi</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] used product/substrate ratios of fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in serum phospholipids to speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-energy <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> have a reduced level of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Δ5</NUMEX>-desaturase activity compared to well-nourished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        This particular desaturase is a regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> responsible for the biosynthesis of long-chain
        polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acid families</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> exhibit some
        of the characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX>, such as lower
        weight-for-age and lower lean body mass, the activity of
        the)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-desaturase in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> may be decreased,
        resulting in lower proportions of the long-chain
        polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> in both serum and membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> important determinants of membrane fluidity are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> content and the proportions of the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        that comprise the phospholipids of membranes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to
        compare the fluidity of membranes between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> is to determine the mean melting point (MMP) of
        the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the total phospholipid fraction of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. For such a purpose, we used the method of Jensen
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patton</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] to estimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> of red cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX>. We found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> of the membrane
        phospholipids of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> was significantly
        higher compared to controls, indicating a decrease in
        membrane fluidity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. A negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> was also observed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> and phase angle.
        This observation suggests that the chemical composition and
        properties of tissue membranes, specifically the acyl
        chains of the membrane phospholipids, directly influence
        the magnitude of the phase angle of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.
        When we examined the relation between phase angle and
        red cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, a significant negative correlation
        was obtained between phase angle and red cell cholesterol
        for the total pool of subjects (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> plus controls)
        (p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>). However, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regression models</ENAMEX> were used that
        included <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFM</ENAMEX>, only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFM</ENAMEX> were
        found to be significantly correlated with phase angle.
        The implications of the observed alterations in the
        membrane lipids of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> are not known;
        however, by affecting the physical properties of tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX>, including fluidity and capacitance, these
        changes could compromise various membrane functions. In an 
        in vitro study using red cells from
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthy subjects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuypers</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] showed that the deformability and
        stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> red cells could be altered by changing the
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of the phosphatidylcholine (PC)
        molecules of the membrane. For example, when they replaced
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> PC with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-palmitoyl, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">arachidonoyl</NUMEX>-PC in normal
        cells, the cells exhibited decreased osmotic fragility
        without a change in hydration. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> PC with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dipalmitoyl</NUMEX>-PC resulted in an increase
        in both osmotic fragility and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hydration</ENAMEX>. In
        contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> PC of sickle cells with
        either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-palmitoyl</TIMEX>,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-2arachidonyl</TIMEX> PC, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>-dipalmitoyl PC, or
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-palmitoyl</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-oleoyl PC led to increased cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydration</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of cellular
        hydration of sickle cells may be modulated by altering the
        molecular species composition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipids</ENAMEX>. In a study of subjects with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borkman</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] found that decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> was associated with a decrease in the
        proportions of polyunsaturated fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in
        skeletal-muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phospholipids</ENAMEX>. They speculated that changes
        in the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of muscle membranes could
        affect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>.
        We reported previously significantly lower phase angle
        values in both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nigerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 27</NUMEX> ] . Because phase angle is related to the
        amount of lean body tissue and the corresponding amounts of
        tissue membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , it could be that the lower phase
        angle we observed previously in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nigerian</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were the result of the lower FFM
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> compared to their corresponding controls.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 10</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, usually have significantly less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FFM</ENAMEX> than their
        healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . However, in the present
        study, although there were no significant differences in
        the mean weight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, or FFM of the controls and the SCD
        subjects, nevertheless, we still observed a statistically
        significant difference in the calculated phase angle of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We suggest, therefore, that factors other than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFM</ENAMEX> and which are not related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size, such as the
        lipid composition of cell membranes, can influence the
        phase angle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
        It is reasonable to ask whether dietary modification or
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid supplementation</ENAMEX> might change the fatty acid
        composition of tissue phospholipids in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX>.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate supplementation studies involving SCD
        subjects, changes in the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> composition of red cell
        phospholipids were obtained after supplementation with fish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> containing high amounts of long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> polyunsaturated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-3</ENAMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muskeit</ENAMEX> and coworkers
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">supplemented 13 SCD</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">capsules</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eicosapentaenoic acid</ENAMEX>, docosahexaenoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E.</ENAMEX> This supplementation regimen resulted
        in increased incorporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 fatty acids</ENAMEX> in both
        plasma cholesterylesters and red blood cells. The
        double-bond index of the red cells increased, indicating an
        increase in red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> membrane fluidity and deformability.
        In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomer</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] also
        demonstrated changes in platelet and red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> activation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> following fish oil
        supplementation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>, resulting in fewer pain
        episodes compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-6</ENAMEX> fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        In summary, we have shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCD</ENAMEX> that the
        lipid composition of their cellular membranes is related to
        phase angle, a non-invasive whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> measurement of
        membrane integrity and function. Membrane function is
        altered in a variety of clinical conditions and the phase
        angle may provide a rapid, non-invasive means of monitoring
        the effect of therapies aimed at improving the health of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in whom cell membrane function may be deranged.
        Although it is known that supplementation with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3</ENAMEX> fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> produces changes in the membrane composition of
        cells, it has yet to be determined whether phase angle can
        be used as an alternative approach for monitoring these
        changes. Studies of this nature are in progress.
