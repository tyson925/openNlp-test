        The regulation of gene expression is a fundamental
        process within every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> that often allows exquisite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over a gene's activity (for review see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]).
        Altering transcription rates is an effective strategy for
        regulating gene activity. It is well established that
        transcription of a given gene is dependent upon a promoter
        sequence located within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few hundred</TIMEX> base pairs of the
        transcriptional start site. Promoter activity is modulated
        by sequence-specific transcription factors that physically
        interact either with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that make up the
        core transcriptional machinery or with the promoter
        sequence itself.
        In eukaryotes, the activity of a promoter can be
        modified by transcription factors binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences
        (frequently termed 
        cis -regulatory modules or enhancers)
        that are located from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of
        base pairs away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. These regulatory modules
        can either increase or decrease the rate of transcription
        for a target gene, depending on the cellular state and the
        activities of the bound transcription factors. There are
        several mechanisms by which transcription factors bound to
        regulatory modules exert their effects. First, many
        transcription factors interact directly with the core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcriptional</ENAMEX> machinery by recruiting the latter's
        protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, transcription
        factors may bend or twist the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, altering the way in
        which other transcription factors interact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, transcription factors can alter local chromatin
        structure by modifying histones (typically through
        methylation, acetylation, and substitution of histone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX>) to permit or restrict access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        Modifications of chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> also occur at much
        larger scales. Most eukaryotes exhibit distinct chromosomal
        regions that are usually either transcriptionally active
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">euchromatin</NUMEX>) or inactive (heterochromatin). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterochromatin</ENAMEX> is typically found near centromeres and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of low sequence complexity.
        Less clear are the mechanisms by which the regulation
        provided by a 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">module</ENAMEX> is restricted
        to specific target genes. Several examples of insulators -
        sequences that prevent neighboring modules from affecting
        transcription - have been identified (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insulators</ENAMEX> seem to function not by deactivating 
        cis -regulatory modules but by
        preventing their influence from being propagated along the
        chromosome. It is not known how common insulators are in
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (or any other) genome.
        Some insulator-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> localize to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromosomal</ENAMEX> positions, and these positions coincide with
        genomic sequences that are not heavily compacted by
        chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (the 'interbands' of polytene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromosomes</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. There is substantial evidence that,
        although gene expression can be tightly controlled,
        neighboring genes or chromatin regions are important for
        the expression of individual genes. For example, otherwise
        identical transgenes inserted into different chromosomal
        sites show varying levels of expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent observations lend credence to the idea that
        genomes may be divided into domains important for
        controlling the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of adjacent genes.
        First, there is evidence from budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> that some genes
        are found in pairs or triplets of adjacent genes that
        display similar expression patterns [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX>
        much larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the human genome show a strong
        clustering of highly expressed genes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], which is caused
        by clustering of genes that are expressed in nearly all
        tissues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. We have examined the fraction of genes in the
        
        Drosophila genome that are subject to
        regulation that reflects large domains, using data from
        high-density oligonucleotide microarrays that reflect over
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> experimental conditions, and have found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> clustered into co-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-30</NUMEX>
        genes.
      
      
        Results
        
          Many neighboring genes show similar expression
          patterns
          We collected relative gene-expression profiles
          covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> distinct experimental conditions from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">267</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome Arrays</ENAMEX> (see
          Materials and methods section). When the genes in this
          dataset were organized according to their positions along
          the chromosome, we observed numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of physically
          adjacent genes that shared strikingly similar expression
          profiles. We sought to measure the magnitude of this
          effect by identifying all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of physically adjacent
          genes that showed pair-wise correlations between their
          expression profiles that were higher than expected by
          chance.
          Visual inspection of the entire dataset using TreeView
          software [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of adjacent genes with
          similar expression patterns appeared frequently in our
          real dataset but rarely in a randomized dataset. The size
          of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> varied, but appeared to average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>
          genes. In order to systematically identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjacent</ENAMEX>, similarly expressed genes, we calculated the
          average pair-wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation of gene expression
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a sliding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-gene window across the genome.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation is a commonly used metric for
          determining the similarity between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gene expression
          profiles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and the average pair-wise correlation is
          the average of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlations of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
          possible pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-gene set. We
          estimated the probability of the average correlation
          scores by randomly sampling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> times from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> and calculating the average pair-wise correlation
          for windows of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. We also created a random
          dataset of the same size, by randomly shuffling the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to expression profiles, and used
          this to illustrate the significance of our results. Our
          analyses show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of physically adjacent genes
          with similar expression are common; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1,100</NUMEX> such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are significant at a 
          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -2</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In more
          conservative analyses (requiring an uncorrected 
          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>), where we expect
          to observe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> by chance, in fact we observed
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          To ensure that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-gene windows were appropriate, we
          repeated the analysis using windows of various sizes. As
          the window size increases from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the
          net number of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (that is, the genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in the ordered dataset minus genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from
          the random dataset) increases linearly. At a window size
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the net number of genes begins to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plateau</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This suggests that most groups
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, so we used a window size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          for the remainder of our analysis. There are no
          qualitative differences in the nature of groups
          identified by larger window sizes.
          Many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-gene groups that have high average
          pair-wise correlations of gene expression represent
          physically overlapping stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (that is, genes
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> through 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> make up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and genes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> through 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> form another). For all
          further analyses, therefore, we collapsed all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that
          bordered one another into a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. This
          substantially reduced the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, showing that
          the effect on expression extends well beyond <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> genes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly 1,100 ten</NUMEX>-gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are significant
          at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 10 -2</ENAMEX>, but these collapse
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 211</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with an average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> size of
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. As the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values decrease the average group
          size also decreases, but even at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 10 -4there</ENAMEX> are, on average,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in each group (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">553</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>; see Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">681</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in total) that map to the
          left arm of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and have a 
          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> -2are
          shown, using a ratiogram [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] aligned to the chromosome
          arm, in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> along the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX> appears random and there is little bias for
          genes in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to be on the same strand. The length of
          genomic sequence occupied by similarly expressed gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> is highly variable. The average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> size is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 125</NUMEX> kilo-base pairs (kbp) in length, with a
          standard deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 90</NUMEX> kbp, while the smallest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> kbp and the largest is over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> kbp. As might
          be expected, there is a relationship between the number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> covered
          by each group (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.59</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are not explained by gene function or
          homology
          Many genes that are related by function share similar
          expression patterns, and it is plausible that the same is
          true for homologous genes, particularly those that arose
          from recent duplications. In 
          Drosophila there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,207</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          for which there is a homolog within the genome and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> are separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. To
          determine whether homologs account for our observations,
          we repeated our analysis on a dataset from which homologs
          that are physically near one another were removed. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just under 12,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and although there is
          a significant decrease in the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> found to
          be in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in this dataset (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">176</NUMEX> groups
          remain, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          We considered an extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to account for our
          observations - that evolutionary selection has organized
          gene groups according to the biological processes the
          genes are involved in, so that their expression can be
          coordinately regulated. We sought to test this model
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GO</ENAMEX>) database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>] as a
          source of annotations of biological processes. We first
          used the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the
          probability of observing each GO term as enriched in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, on the basis of the number of genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          the number of genes in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that are annotated with
          that GO term, and the number of genes in the genome that
          are annotated with that GO term. We then selected all GO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'process</ENAMEX>' terms associated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>
          genes had the selected GO term. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">211</NUMEX> groups
          identified in our full dataset and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">176</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from
          the 'homologs-removed' dataset, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43 and 11</TIMEX> GO terms,
          respectively, have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that meet the
          above criteria. These numbers are modestly higher than
          would be expected by placing a random selection of genes
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, where we would expect <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 ± 2</NUMEX> from the full
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 ± 2</NUMEX> from the homologs-removed dataset. The
          observed enrichment is clearly dependent on homologs,
          however, given the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly four</NUMEX>-fold decrease in observed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> when homologs are excluded from the
          analysis. Thus, with the present level of functional
          annotation, the vast majority of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> we observe
          are not composed of genes with similar biological
          processes, and the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is not supported.
        
        
          Similarly expressed gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> can be identified
          from smaller datasets
          Our dataset is derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA samples</ENAMEX> taken from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> show a pattern of gene expression that mirrors
          this bifurcation: most genes are expressed at higher
          levels in either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> or embryos. We wished to
          determine whether our observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reflect this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>, so we divided our dataset in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, creating one
          dataset of 'embryo' experiments and one of 'adult'
          experiments. It should be noted that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the adult
          experiments contained <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>,
          which contain a substantial number of oocytes, whereas
          the rest of the dataset was only from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. We
          calculated the average pair-wise correlations for all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new datasets; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          4summarizes the number of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for the embryo
          and adult datasets (both randomized and ordered). The
          gene numbers are remarkably similar to those found for
          the entire dataset, as are the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (see the
          Additional data files).
          We wished to know if there was a correlation between
          the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> identified in the adult, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX>, and
          combined datasets. To do this we tabulated all genes
          identified in each dataset at each of three 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -3and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>)
          and calculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation between each pair
          of datasets at each 
          p value (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The average
          correlation between either the embryo or the adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> and the combined dataset is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.35</NUMEX>, while the
          average correlation between the adult and embryo datasets
          is lower (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 0.23</NUMEX>). The number of genes involved makes
          little difference, because the correlations are similar
          at each 
          p value, despite the vastly
          different numbers of genes identified at different 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values. In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">890</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are
          present in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> defined by one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> datasets
          at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 10 -4</ENAMEX>. After correcting for
          genes expected to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by chance, about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are identified in one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> datasets
          at a 
          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -3and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,000</NUMEX>
          genes are identified at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 -2</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Correlations with known chromosome
          structures
          We attempted to determine whether the locations of
          similarly expressed gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> correlate with known
          chromosome structures. Polytene chromosomes show a
          distinct, reproducible pattern of extended and compacted
          regions. The compacted regions contain the vast majority
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, although the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> can
          vary by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> order of magnitude. The mean DNA
          content of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kbp</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>] as
          compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 125</NUMEX> kbp for each group of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed genes. We calculated the number of bands
          that overlap (or are contained in) each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and
          compared this with the number of bands that overlap (or
          are contained in) a randomly placed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> matched for
          size. There was very little difference in the average
          number of bands overlapping each co-expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or
          each randomly placed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.6</NUMEX>).
          It has been proposed that 
          Drosophila chromosomes are attached
          to a nuclear scaffold at precise locations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], but
          there is very limited mapping data on the position of
          these attachments. Mirkovitch 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] mapped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> attachment
          sites in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX> kbp <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> near the 
          rosy gene on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3R</NUMEX>,
          dividing the region into a number of discrete domains of
          average size <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kbp, each containing many genes. We
          wished to determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> we identified
          might correspond to distinct regions between attachment
          sites, as several of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> fall in the region
          studied by Mirkovitch 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. We attempted to align
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> but there are no clear overlaps; the sizes
          and positions of the domains identified between
          attachment sites did not correspond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> we
          found.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 20%</NUMEX> of the genes in the 
        Drosophila genome appear to fall into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such that the genes within each group
        are expressed similarly across a wide range of experimental
        conditions. Our data do not reveal the mechanism(s)
        responsible for the observed similarities in expression of
        adjacent genes but we believe the findings are most
        consistent with regulation at the level of chromatin
        structure, for the following reasons. First, the regions
        showing similarities in expression are quite large,
        containing on average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, with each gene presumably
        having its own core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it is frequently the
        case that one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> display a high level
        of differential expression (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>). If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> in a region of the chromosome that contained many
        genes was 'opened' so that a single target gene could be
        expressed, it might increase the accessibility of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> and enhancers of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcriptional</ENAMEX> machinery, leading to modest parallel
        increases in their expression. Such an effect could account
        for the observations we have made.
        Discussions of transcriptional regulation often
        emphasize the belief that the process is tightly controlled
        and essentially error-free. We believe that the degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX>, at least at a quantitative level, may be less
        than is generally assumed. For example, only a few genes
        show an obvious phenotype when heterozygous, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygosity</ENAMEX> generally results in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold reduction in
        expression level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Moreover, there are numerous
        examples in the literature of genes that, when misexpressed
        either temporally or spatially, do not generate a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Although it is difficult to prove that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> carrying such traits are as fit as their normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, it is likely that the precise regulation of many
        genes is allowed to vary considerably. If we presume that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> we have observed arise because of selection on
        the regulation of a small subset of genes in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
        then the vast majority of genes are in effect being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'carried</ENAMEX> along for a ride'. The regulation of transcription
        may be precise when it is needed and sloppy when it is not
        important.
        If coordinated gene expression is unimportant, there
        should be no selection that drives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-regulated genes we observed to be evolutionarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. It will be possible to test this when the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura sequence is
        completed. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes we identify here are
        found to be more syntenic in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> pseudoobscura genomes than
        expected, that would support the idea that the observed
        coordinated expression is advantageous.
        Although we have assayed a relatively large number of
        biological samples, we cannot infer the profiles of unique
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. As further experiments are carried out it
        may be that our observation of similarly regulated groups
        will grow to include all genes - that is, the entire
        euchromatic genome may be structured in such domains.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection
          We collected a dataset composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> experimental
          conditions hybridized to a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">267</NUMEX> GeneChip
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Genome Arrays</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX>, CA,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. This dataset came from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> independent
          investigations that will be described in detail elsewhere
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Bailey</ENAMEX>, personal communication; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Brodsky</ENAMEX>, personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E. De Gregorio</ENAMEX> personal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication; A. Tang</ENAMEX>, personal communication; and P.
          Tomancak, personal communication), which study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          different experimental questions - aging, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-damage
          response, immune response, resistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDT</ENAMEX>, and
          embryonic development. Supplemental data including
          software used in this study and the underlying expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dataset</ENAMEX> is available at our website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and from the
          ArrayExpress database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] with the accession id
          E-RUBN-1.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> processing
          Genes are represented on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">GeneChip</ENAMEX> Drosophila
          Genome Array by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more transcripts, which in turn
          are represented by a probe set. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          pairs of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected at the level of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>, but for ease in the text, the data are
          referred to by gene. Intensity data for each feature on
          the array were calculated from the images generated by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip scanner</ENAMEX>, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">GeneChip</ENAMEX> Microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suite</ENAMEX>. These intensity data were loaded into a MySQL
          database where information on each of the features was
          also stored. The difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and MM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> (probe pair) was calculated, and the
          mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-MM</ENAMEX> intensity for each array was set to a constant
          value by linearly scaling array values. The mean
          intensity of individual probe pairs was calculated across
          all arrays, and the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratio of each value to this mean was
          stored. Next, all log ratios for each probe pair set
          (transcript) were averaged, creating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> measurement for
          each transcript on each array. The final dataset was
          generated by averaging data for each transcript on
          replicate arrays and subtracting the average log ratio of
          each gene in the dataset.
        
        
          Definition of homologs
          BLAST scores based on predicted protein sequence were
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gadfly</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Release 2</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. We used these
          scores to define a homolog <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> as those gene pairs for
          which BLAST 
          E values are less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -7</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Identification of adjacent similarly regulated
          genes
          We calculated the average pair-wise correlation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles for all genes that were within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> -gene window) of one another
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Significance</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values) was estimated by sampling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> sets of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> genes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 million</NUMEX> times to
          determine the likelihood distribution for the dataset. We
          also calculated the average pair-wise correlation for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> dataset in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between genes
          and expression profiles were shuffled. We have calculated
          the number of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at each of the three 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values, namely <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -3</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>, for window sizes ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Next, we set out to show that homologs did not account
          for the increase in the number of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with higher
          than expected average correlations. We searched for cases
          in which homologs (as defined above) were near each other
          in the genome by scanning the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for each
          chromosome from one end to another. If a gene showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to another gene that appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 10</TIMEX> genes
          ahead, it was removed from the dataset, although no break
          in gene order was created. For example, in a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          genes where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third and fourth</TIMEX> were homologs, gene 3
          would be removed, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would consist of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 4</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,369</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          removed from the dataset. This 'homologs removed' dataset
          was subjected to the average pair-wise algorithm, as was
          a randomized version of it.
          We also constructed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> non-overlapping subsets of the
          total data matrix. All hybridizations were divided into
          either the 'embryo' or 'adult' dataset on the basis of
          the source of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> used in that hybridization. In
          total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> experiments remained in the embryo dataset and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> experiments remained in the adult dataset. The random
          pair-wise correlation algorithm was applied independently
          to each of these datasets as well as to randomized
          versions of each dataset.
        
        
          Significantly enriched GO terms among gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>
          GO terms for all genes were obtained from the GO
          database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Using the hypergeometric distribution,
          the probability of observing each GO term with each group
          was calculated. Briefly, the probability 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> that a GO term is significantly
          enriched among a specified set of genes can be calculated
          with the following formula:
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is the number of genes in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, 
          G is the total number of genes, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is the number of genes in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> with a given annotation and 
          A is the total number of genes with
          a given annotation. Because many sets of GO terms (>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX>) were tested on many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 200</NUMEX>),
          there is a problem of multiple testing. All GO terms
          significantly associated with a group of similarly
          expressed genes at a 
          p value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -4were
          recorded.
        
        
          Correlation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with known chromosomal
          structures
          We determined the number of polytene bands present in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of similarly expressed genes. The coordinates
          of each group were determined by using the transcription
          start sites (from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GadFly Release 2</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] of the genes at
          each end of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. We then determined how many bands
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlapped</ENAMEX> each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> based on the positions reported [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. We also calculated the number of bands that
          overlap randomly placed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (with the same sizes as
          the real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Additional data files
        The following are provided as supplemental materials; a
        tab-delimited text fileof the underlying expression data;
        the perl scriptsused to process the data; and a text
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fileused</ENAMEX> to generate Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. All expression data are
        reported as log base 2 and are mean centered (the mean
        expression value for each gene in all experiments is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>).
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column of each expression data file is the CT
        identifier of each transcript. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> column is a
        description field, which includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> identifier, CG
        identifier, gene name, and brief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Ontology</ENAMEX> annotations.
        The remainder of the columns contain expression data,
        classified by the column header (either adult or embryo).
        The data used to generate Figure 2can be loaded into the
        TreeView software [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] to visualize individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (null
