        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Chronic hepatitis C virus</ENAMEX> (HCV) infection is a slowly
        progressive disease that affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.7 million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C are asymptomatic, although some experience
        fatigue or other nonspecific symptoms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . The
        minority progress to cirrhosis, liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, or liver
        failure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> must weigh
        the immediate harm associated with treatment for HCV
        including side effects and cost of therapy against
        potential future benefits when making treatment decisions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interferon</ENAMEX> and ribavirin cause a number of adverse effects
        including fatigue, flu-like symptoms, insomnia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>, and cytopenia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . The cost of therapy is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately $1,000</NUMEX> per month with additional charges for
        laboratory testing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s visits. On the other
        hand, a sustained response to therapy is associated with
        persistently undetectable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HCV RNA</ENAMEX>, improved liver
        histology, and gains in health-related quality of life [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Limited information is available about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>'
        perceptions of quality of life with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX>' perspectives on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> and its treatment may
        influence the advice that they give to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> about
        the disease. In the current study, we used utility analysis
        to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' perspectives about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C and
        its therapy. Utility analysis provides a means to quantify
        preference values about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> states [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . The aims
        of the study were: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to assess whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> could
        provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health state constructs
        using visual analog scales, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) to quantify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>'
        judgments about various <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
        to assess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' thresholds for recommending
        treatment.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> and study instrument
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> consisted of a convenience sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> were surveyed when they attended
          continuing medical education lectures in Gastroenterology
          given in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. The questionnaire was administered using a
          paper and pencil format and was completed before the
          lecture. Demographic information included gender, race,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, and specialty. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were asked if they
          treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hepatitis C.</ENAMEX> Five <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
          health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (HS) were described ranging from HS1-No
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Symptoms, No Cirrhosis to HS5-Severe Symptoms</ENAMEX>, Cirrhosis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The descriptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were developed based on the findings of our
          previous study of symptoms in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and
          on a consensus of a group of hepatologists experienced in
          managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C. The description of
          the side effects of treatment was based on published
          accounts of the adverse effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribavirin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 15</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> rated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health states using a
          visual analog scale where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> represented death and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          corresponded to life without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C. We designated
          life without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C as the highest preference value
          and assessed preferences for the health state <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Symptoms, No</ENAMEX> cirrhosis because the psychological
          impact of having a disease can effect health status in
          the absence of physical symptoms. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> also rated
          side effects of antiviral therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C on a
          visual analog scale. Finally, participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
          provided their threshold for recommending antiviral
          therapy. That is, the sustained virologic response rate
          that they would require before they would recommend
          treatment to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Preference values for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were
          compared using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> test. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> test was used to evaluate the relationship between
          categorical demographic variables and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>'
          preference values. The relationship between continuous
          demographic variables and preference values was assessed
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spearman</ENAMEX> test. This test also was used to evaluate
          for an association between preference values for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, ratings of side effects of
          antiviral therapy, and treatment threshold.
        
      
      
        Results
        Demographic data for the participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are
        presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The majority was primary care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>), including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Practitioners</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX>' preference values for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Utility values decreased as
        health state severity increased (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). The median
        preference value for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HS1</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Symptoms, No Cirrhosis</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX>
        (interquartile range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%-95%</NUMEX>) corresponding to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>
        reduction from life without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C. In contrast the
        median preference value for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HS5-Severe Symptoms</ENAMEX>, Cirrhosis
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 18%</NUMEX> (interquartile range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%-30%</NUMEX>).
        The median preference value for life with the side
        effects of antiviral therapy was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> (interquartile range
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%-55%</NUMEX>). That is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> felt that side effects were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> reduction from good health. After
        considering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and the side effects of
        therapy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> indicated that they would require a
        median of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> sustained response rate (interquartile
        range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%-80%</NUMEX>) before recommending treatment. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only 13%</NUMEX> of
        participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> would accept the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> response rate
        offered by current antiviral therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with HCV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">genotype 1</ENAMEX> disease (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Health state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> values did not vary significantly
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' age, gender, race, specialty or whether
        they treated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C. Ratings of side effects and
        thresholds for recommending treatment were similar across
        the demographic variables. There were no significant
        correlations between preference values for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
        health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, ratings of side effects of therapy, and
        treatment thresholds.
      
      
        Discussion
        In the current study, we developed and evaluated
        descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and side effects
        of antiviral therapy. We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> understood
        these descriptions and were able to provide utility
        assessments using a visual analog scale. Preference values
        declined significantly with increasing health state
        severity supporting the validity of the health state
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructs</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C causes a dramatic
        reduction in health status. Even the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX>
        C, without symptoms or cirrhosis (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HS 1</NUMEX>), was judged to
        carry a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> decrement from life without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX>. Our findings
        parallel those of a study that used the time-trade off
        method to assess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' preference values for health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, the median preference value for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
        without symptoms in our series was between that provided
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV</ENAMEX> without symptoms (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> without symptoms
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>) in the previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        The large range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' rating of treatment side
        effects (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is striking and indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>'
        views about the impact of side effects on health status
        vary substantially. However, the side effects of antiviral
        therapy were judged severely overall, with a median
        preference value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>. That is, time on therapy was felt
        to be associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> reduction from good health. The
        median preference value for treatment side effects was
        similar to that provided for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HS3-Moderate Symptoms</ENAMEX>, No
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cirrhosis</ENAMEX>.
        On average, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> indicated that they would require
        a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> sustained response before recommending therapy to
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> threshold far exceeds the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>
        sustained response rate to interferon and ribavirin therapy
        reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C genotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> infection
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 13%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> reported a
        threshold for recommending therapy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> or less. The
        unfavorable assessment of treatment side effects reported
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in the current study provides one explanation
        for relatively low referral rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C among
        primary care providers. A survey of primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 62%</NUMEX> refer anti-HCV positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        abnormal transaminase levels to sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        .
        The lack of a significant correlation between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>' ratings of treatment side effects and their
        thresholds for recommending treatment is surprising. We
        would expect clinicians to make decisions that are
        consistent with their views on the harm and benefit of a
        particular therapy. Our data show that a group of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>, comprised largely of primary care providers,
        would require a high degree of benefit in terms of response
        rate to recommend therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX>, which was not
        necessarily related to their perspectives on the harm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with treatment side effects. The absence of such
        a relationship may reflect limited knowledge about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C and response rates to therapy or preconceived
        notions about the disease and its treatment. This finding
        is particularly important because primary care providers
        often decide whether to refer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-specialist</ENAMEX>.
        They also educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and shape their views about new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnoses</ENAMEX>. Continuing education for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> about the
        natural history and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C is of key
        importance in helping them to provide optimal advice to
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Advances in antiviral therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C will
        affect how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> view the issue of
        treatment. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pegylated interferon</ENAMEX> and ribavirin will increase sustained
        response rates to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> overall, and to greater
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C genotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> infection
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hepatologists</ENAMEX> need to understand other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>'
        perspectives on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C so that they can adequately
        address their concerns about treatment issues.
        Further work is needed to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to understand
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' views on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C. A recent study showed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C preferred to expedite periods
        of poor health, implying that they may be more likely to
        proceed with antiviral therapy and its attendant side
        effects than to delay treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> in the current survey had a relatively high
        threshold for recommending treatment, which would lead them
        to postpone therapy in the majority of cases. Utility
        analysis may have a role in facilitating joint
        decision-making between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> regarding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C.
        This study does have limitations. We studied a
        convenience sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> attending continuing
        medical education lectures. The findings could be biased
        because we did not collect data on response rates or on the
        demographic features of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who did not complete the
        survey. Furthermore, although the study population
        consisted largely of primary care providers, some
        sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> were included. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> do
        represent a cross-section of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who may be involved
        with the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have developed and evaluated health state
        descriptions for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Physicians</ENAMEX> felt that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were associated with a
        substantial decrement in health status. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> provided
        particularly low preference values for side effects of
        antiviral therapy and high thresholds for recommending
        treatment. However, ratings of side effects were not
        significantly correlated with thresholds for recommending
        therapy, suggesting that additional factors effect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physicians</ENAMEX> views about antiviral therapy. The use of
        utility analysis could provide a basis for shared
        decision-making between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C.
