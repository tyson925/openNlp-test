        Unfortunately, most clinicians either do not seek
        evidence or ineffectively seek evidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .Practicing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX> rarely search <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ,and, when they do,
        they usually find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the germane research that a
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> finds [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarians</ENAMEX> can only
        find evidence to answer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the questions posed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        .As a result, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> are "practicing with less
        than has been proved" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        To encourage evidence-seeking, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> have been taught
        critical appraisal of medical research. Regardless of the
        instructional format (such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal Club</ENAMEX>"), research has
        demonstrated that this instruction does not increase
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' actual use of literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        We hypothesized that we could increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>'
        frequency of searching for evidence by focusing on how to
        find evidence, as well as how to appraise it. We conducted
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> controlled trials to test this hypothesis. In the first
        trial, we taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> how to
        search for evidence as well as how to appraise evidence.
        Prior to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trial, we created an Internet site,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMSearch</ENAMEX> ( <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://SUMSearch</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTHSCSA</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ,to
        automate finding evidence. We taught how to appraise
        evidence and how to use SUMSearch to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the
        intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Results were measured with
        questionnaires at the end of the study periods.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Subjects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were third-year medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas Health Science Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>.
          During the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine clerkship</ENAMEX>, we taught the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> how
          to find and appraise medical evidence. We performed two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quasirandomized</ENAMEX> controlled studies (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-1998</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX>). For each trial, we surveyed the entire class
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200</NUMEX> third-year medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> had taken
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> (intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>). The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
          comprised the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> assignment occurred in a quasirandomized manner.
          At our institution <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> place themselves into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> to12 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean's Office</ENAMEX> combines
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in order to achieve
          similar distributions of gender, ethnicity, and academic
          performance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>'s office randomly assigns medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to a sequence of rotations. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> from each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> draws from a bowl a number that indicates the order
          of clerkship rotations.
        
        
          Interventions
          
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-1998</TIMEX> Trial
            We made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> computers available to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in
            key clinical locations. Each computer provided the
            following software compatible with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Windows ®</ENAMEX>:
            Scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Textbook of Medicine ®</ENAMEX>, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane Library ®</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Best Evidence ®</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> was
            accessible with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OVID ®Windows ®Client</ENAMEX>, which was
            customized with search filters [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The Internet
            access encouraged use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Database of Abstracts of</ENAMEX>
            Reviews of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Effectiveness</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>), practice guidelines,
            online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal clubs</ENAMEX>. The computers had a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">customized interface</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) that displayed and
            organized these resources. The interface, which could
            not be removed, offered context-sensitive, online help
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>: "lifelong.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hlp</ENAMEX>") and tracked the
            usage of each resource. We used the usage logs to guide
            enhancements to the interface. Because we prioritized
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accessibility</ENAMEX> and the ability to log in rapidly, we did
            not use usernames and passwords to track individual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. We taught the intervention group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> how
            to find and appraise medical evidence using the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> on these computers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX> Trial
            We made several changes in our resources after the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study. Because of developments in the Internet,
            we converted access to all resources to the Internet
            via the public address, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://Clinical.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTHSCSA</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>.
            This allowed access from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and
            easier maintenance. We replaced the Windows ®interface
            on our clinical computers with a customized Internet
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">browser</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> page was this Internet address. We
            had observed during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trial that searching for
            evidence, even after instruction, was still very
            difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. Because searching for medical
            evidence can follow an algorithm, we created SUMSearch
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://SUMSearch</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTHSCSA</ENAMEX>.edu, an Internet site that
            automates searching for medical evidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMSearch</ENAMEX> searches for medical evidence at high quality
            Internet sites including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guideline</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clearinghouse</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMSearch</ENAMEX> searches PubMed
            with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different strategies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> strategies are
            for finding systematic reviews, practice guidelines,
            and traditional review articles, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> will
            find original research using validated search filters [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMSearch</ENAMEX> automatically reformats
            and re-executes the search for original research
            multiple times until the best possible results are
            found.
            Based on feedback from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> between studies
            during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1998-1999</TIMEX> academic year, we also changed our
            educational intervention. We reduced instruction on
            each individual resource, but we increased instruction
            on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMSearch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
            At the same time as our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trial, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Medicine</ENAMEX> was also teaching an evidence-based
            course in their clerkship. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
            who had been on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Medicine</ENAMEX> rotation during the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> received that intervention. The
            Family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX> intervention consisted of three
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> sessions that taught how to frame clinical
            questions, search for evidence, and critically appraise
            evidence. A comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> indicated
            that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> course focused on how to
            find evidence, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Medicine</ENAMEX> course focused
            on how to appraise evidence.
          
        
        
          Outcomes
          The principal outcomes were self-report of search
          frequency, satisfaction with results, and satisfaction
          with speed of searching. We queried these principal
          outcomes identically in both trials. We also asked in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trial whether search frequency influenced patient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. In both trials, we assessed retention of content,
          although we do not report these results at this time.
          For both trials, surveys were administered at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the third-year
          class had taken the course. The median time between
          completion of the course and administration of the
          questionnaires was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the
          intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Analyses
          Principal outcomes measuring search frequencies and
          influence from searching were dichotomized into at least
          once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and less often or no answer. Outcomes
          measuring satisfaction were dichotomized into being
          satisfied with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of search and less often or
          no answer.
          Questionnaires were analyzed by intervention and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. We tested significance with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> test. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trial, we performed a
          Mantel-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Haenszel</ENAMEX> analysis to quantify the independent
          contributions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine and Family</ENAMEX>
          Medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> on the outcomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-1998</TIMEX> study
          Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">207</NUMEX> third-year medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trial,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> completed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-end</TIMEX> questionnaire:
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who had attended the course and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> who had not. We excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> incomplete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">questionnaires</ENAMEX>.
          Table 2summarizes their self-reported behaviors. The
          intervention and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> did not differ
          significantly in self-report of frequency of literature
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">searches</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20% and 17%</NUMEX>, respectively), satisfaction with
          quality of results (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32% and 28%</NUMEX>, respectively), and
          satisfaction with speed of searching (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24% and 17%</NUMEX>,
          respectively).
        
        
          B. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX> study
          Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> third-year medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the second
          trial, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> completed the questionnaire, of
          which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> had completed their
          medicine clerkship and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> had not.
          Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with missing results, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> were on one
          rotation that we could not access during the survey
          period. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> had been randomly assigned to a
          sequence of rotations that placed both their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX>
          Medicine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Medicine</ENAMEX> rotations in the latter part
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, and thus the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> contains more
          missing data.
          Similar to the results of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study, there were
          no significant differences in self-reported habits
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We detected an insignificant
          trend for control group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to search more and be
          more satisfied with quality and speed of their
          searches.
          Lastly, we stratified the analysis by whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
          had received both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, one course, or no course. No
          combined impact was detected on frequency of searching or
          satisfaction with searching. The only significant finding
          was self-report of being influenced by a literature
          search. Mantel-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Haenszel</ENAMEX> analysis confirmed that this
          effect was attributable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Medicine</ENAMEX> course,
          even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Medicine</ENAMEX> course was not associated
          with increased search frequency.
        
        
          Comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies
          Among all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, the self-report of frequent
          searching and satisfaction with results significantly
          increased from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-1998</TIMEX> to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX> study
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Searching once a week or more increased from
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> were more
          satisfied with their results (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>) than with speed (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>)
          of their searches. Satisfaction with speed of searches
          did not increase.
        
        
          Power analysis
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1997-1998</TIMEX> study, the intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
          smaller (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1999-2000</TIMEX> study, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was smaller (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>). Both studies had
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately an 80%</NUMEX> chance of detecting a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> absolute
          difference between the intervention and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] .
          There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> non-responders in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-1998</TIMEX> study.
          Among these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, if all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the
          intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> control group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> had actually become frequent searchers, the
          prevalence of frequent searchers would have been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>, respectively. This result and a similar reanalysis
          of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX> would have been statistically
          significant.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Neither of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> courses nor the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> course in conjunction with the
        Family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX> course increased the self-report of search
        frequency. Despite teaching both searching for and
        appraising evidence, our results are consistent with the
        negative impact of "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal clubs</ENAMEX>" [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Possibly,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> lack time to search for evidence. In both study
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were less satisfied with the speed of their
        searches than the results of their searches.
        Although all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> reported increased searching and
        satisfaction with in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> had no impact.
        In addition, it is doubtful that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SUMSearch (™</ENAMEX>) Internet
        site, which was taught only to the intervention students
        but available to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, was responsible. Search
        frequency increased more in the control than the
        intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31% and 18%</NUMEX>, respectively). Search
        frequency increased most in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX>, when the control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> again reported more frequent searching than the
        intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48% and 38%</NUMEX>, respectively). Although
        search frequency increased, the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>'
        medical searches was unclear. Other studies have reported
        the apparent satisfaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice searchers</ENAMEX> with searches
        of uncertain quality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 12</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, clinicians
        demonstrated satisfaction with their searches even though
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">librarians</ENAMEX>, who later replicated the searches, found twice
        as many relevant studies and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as many irrelevant
        studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Our power analysis reveals that we might have missed a
        positive result if all non-responders had answered in a way
        to favor an intervention effect. However, we believe that
        non-response more likely indicated reluctance to report
        infrequent literature searching. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study,
        logistical reasons prevented us from surveying all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> rotation in the control study. In the first
        study, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were surveyed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> at the
        same time; however, fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the intervention
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> completed their questionnaire. We believe that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who adopted our teachings and became frequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">searchers</ENAMEX> after our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> were unlikely to sit in the room
        and not complete the questionnaire. Therefore, we believe
        that having better response rates would not reveal a
        positive effect, but rather would make the results even
        more negative in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study.
        Published recommendations vary on how to best search for
        evidence in order to practice evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.
        First, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> recommend using "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Best Evidence</ENAMEX>" at the
        beginning of a search [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . We taught the use of Best
        Evidence during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trial (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), but not during
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study since we had informally observed that Best
        Evidence less often provided answers. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, others
        encourage searching of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane Library</ENAMEX>. We
        discontinued teaching this strategy before our studies,
        because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane Library</ENAMEX> addresses only selected
        therapeutic questions. Instead, we taught the use of the
        Internet site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Database of Abstracts of Reviews of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Effectiveness</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARE</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DARE</ENAMEX> contains succinct summaries of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane</ENAMEX> reviews and high quality systematic reviews from
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that address diagnostic and therapeutic
        questions. We also recommended searching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> for
        additional systematic reviews and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guidelines</ENAMEX>
        Clearinghouse for selected practice guidelines based on
        systematic literature review (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preventive Services Task Force</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Task Force</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preventive Health Care</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> advocate not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">searching MEDLINE</ENAMEX> due to the difficulties in searching it [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . Because very recently published original studies may
        not be included in systematic reviews or secondary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX>, we taught, and automated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMSearch</ENAMEX>, the
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> to search <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PreMEDLINE</ENAMEX> for recent
        studies. Neither our intervention that taught and automated
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> strategy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] nor the intervention by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>
        Medicine, which recommended another strategy using Best
        Evidence and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cochrane Library</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , influenced
        search frequency or satisfaction.
        We propose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> explanations for why our interventions
        failed. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> lacked sufficient time to seek
        evidence. Studies suggest that a wide gap exists between
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 minutes</TIMEX> clinicians typically allot to seeking
        evidence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] and the amount of time needed to search
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 12 13</ENAMEX> ] . Indeed, "some have likened MEDLINE
        searching to attempting to drink <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from a fire hose" [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> is certainly more difficult to
        search than other resources recommended for evidence-based
        medicine, the other resources, in aggregate, probably
        require excessive time to search if they are searched in
        sequence as recommended. Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMSearch</ENAMEX> automated
        searching of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> and other resources for evidence-based
        medicine, generally <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were dissatisfied with the
        speed of searches (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, our search strategy, like the other existing
        search strategies, requires clinicians to spend time
        comparing and contrasting individual documents. All
        strategies recommend starting a search by seeking
        individual documents, whether the document is a study, a
        secondary publication of a single study, or a systematic
        review. Although efficient when a recent, well-done
        systematic review captures all the relevant studies, this
        strategy is burdensome when the results of trials or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">systematic</ENAMEX> reviews are contradictory or when original
        studies have been published since the last systematic
        review. To be sure, a single study may not adequately
        address a clinical question [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        Admittedly, our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> might have increased search
        frequency by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> if the instruction had been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> across all the clerkships and linked to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' clinical duties. However, even with course
        improvements, we might have achieved success in teaching a
        technique that is too cumbersome to use during clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. That is, the technique may require more time than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> will have when they enter practice.
        Further research and development of more efficient
        strategies for seeking medical evidence are needed. Haynes
        recently questioned, "Is it time to change how you seek
        best evidence" and proposed that we first seek evidence in
        resources such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UpToDate, Scientific American</ENAMEX>, or
        Clinical Evidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . These "systematic textbooks"
        contain summaries of medical evidence, are reliably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">updated</ENAMEX>, and are well-referenced with links to the
        abstracts of references. Our negative study supports this
        idea, as it may reduce the need to search for and appraise
        individual studies and systematic reviews. Thus a proposed
        strategy is to search a systematic textbook <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and then
        use an automated meta-search engine to seek evidence
        published since the literature search of the systematic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">textbook</ENAMEX>. However, research is needed to assess the
        validity of the content of systematic textbooks. In
        addition, research is needed to quantify how <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> are
        these resources.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> within one academic year and the
        use of automated searching did not increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>'
        self-report of frequency of seeking medical evidence. While
        we recognize the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' understanding how
        medical evidence is found and appraised, we are concerned
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> lack the time to search for original research
        and will have even less time when they enter medical
        practice. We encourage innovations in evidence-based
        medicine that will reduce the time needed to search for
        medical evidence.
