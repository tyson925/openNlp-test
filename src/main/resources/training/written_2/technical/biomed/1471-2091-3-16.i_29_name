        The cysteine-loop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of ligand gated ion channels
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGIC</ENAMEX>) is comprised of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with pentameric quaternary
        structure and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> ligand binding sites present at
        the subunit interfaces [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is
        characterized by the presence of a critical disulfide loop
        structure within the binding site and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an integral ion</ENAMEX>
        selective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LGIC receptors</ENAMEX> are found in both the
        peripheral and central nervous systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of this
        family include the acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , the
        γ-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butyric acid</ENAMEX> type A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (GABA 
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycine</ENAMEX> receptor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlyR</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> subunit of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R was cloned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The
        sequence of this subunit was shown to be highly homologous
        to LGIC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and thus identified the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Similar to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LGIC receptors</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> subtype has been identified. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> splice
        variants of an A subunit (long and short forms), and a
        single B subunit have been cloned [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . Both
        the long and short forms of the A subunit are capable of
        forming functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homomeric receptors</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AL <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>] although some differences between
        an agonist and partial agonist activity have been observed
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> subtype is formed by a combination of the
        A and B subunits to produce a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heteromeric</ENAMEX> receptor of
        unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Heteromeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacologically</ENAMEX> and functionally distinct from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">homomeric 5-HT</ENAMEX> 
        3AL and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Rs</ENAMEX> are distributed throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> and peripheral nervous system, playing a
        significant role in phenomenon such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>, emesis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Antagonists</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Rs</ENAMEX> are clinically efficacious in the
        treatment of chemotherapy-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and recent
        studies on human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> have suggested their potential
        application in the treatment of early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">onset alcoholism</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] .
        Hibert 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> proposed an early model for the
        antagonist pharmacophore of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . According to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> contain an aromatic
        ring, a carbonyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> or bioisosteric equivalent, and a
        basic nitrogen. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hibert</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the basic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX> is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.2A°</NUMEX> from the centre of the aromatic
        ring and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 1.7A°</NUMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the ring. The
        carbonyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and the aromatic ring are coplanar and
        separated by a distance of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.3A°</TIMEX>. Recent studies have
        expanded on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to include another lipophilic region
        and a second hydrogen bonding interaction <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> atoms away
        from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> that contains all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pharmacophoric regions was synthesized by Orjales 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . This compound
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-(phenylmethyl)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-piperizinyl benzimidazole or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lerisetron</ENAMEX>) is shown in figure 1and is a potent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R antagonist. Functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on
        this compound capable of forming interactions with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> are the distal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, a benzimidazole and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N1</NUMEX> position of the benzimidazole. While
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Lerisetron</ENAMEX> contains no carbonyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> nitrogen
        contained in the benzimidazole heterocycle could act as
        bioisostere of this functional group [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Orjales
        demonstrated the importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> by
        synthesizing several N1 substituted analogs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lerisetron</ENAMEX>.
        Removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-fold decrease
        in affinity, indicating a role for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in
        interacting with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> Other studies have supported this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> and suggest a more specific electrostatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        While structure-activity relationship studies and
        molecular modeling have led to the development of a
        detailed pharmacophore model, determining specific point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">interactions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 5-HT</TIMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> and binding site amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> has proven difficult. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutagenesis</ENAMEX> studies have
        identified the interaction of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids W89</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R91</ENAMEX> in
        the binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 23</NUMEX> ] . Studies
        conducted in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> have identified three
        additional putative binding site <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y140</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX>, and
        Y152) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . W89 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R91</ENAMEX> are present in a conserved
        region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LGIC receptors</ENAMEX> often referred to as loop <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX> are located in the
        region homologus to E loop region of nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AchR</ENAMEX>.
        In this study, we have endeavoured to identify the amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids interacting</ENAMEX> with the different functional groups
        present on the lerisetron molecule in order to develop a
        model for interaction of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> Using site directed mutagenesis in
        combination with analogs of lerisetron, we have identified
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that appear to interact selectively with the
        terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the aromatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzimidazole</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Functional activity of lerisetron
          Whole cell patch-clamp experiments were performed to
          test the functional activity of lerisetron. No response
          was observed when lerisetron was applied alone (data not
          shown). When co-applied with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lerisetron</ENAMEX> inhibited
          the absolute magnitude of the response with no apparent
          alteration of the response profile (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          combination of several identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibition</ENAMEX> experiments
          produced a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2 ± 0.03 nM</NUMEX> for
          lerisetron inhibition of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT induced response. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> correspond well with previously reported data for
          this compound [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and verify the competitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist</ENAMEX> action of lerisetron. Analogs of lerisetron
          have been shown to inhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Rs</ENAMEX> in a similar manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl and distal piperazine
          nitrogen to binding of lerisetron
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i value for lerisetron inhibition of [
          3H]-granisetron binding to wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> was
          determined to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8 ± 0.19 nM</NUMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          This value agrees with previously published data for this
          compound. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">analogs 1 and 2</TIMEX> under
          identical conditions are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 ± 3.2 nM</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> nM
          respectively (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The observed change in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i represents the decreases in binding
          energy resulting from removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl group
          (analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and the distal piperazine nitrogen (analog
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Identification of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids interacting</ENAMEX> with
          Lerisetron
          In order to determine the nature of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          interacting with the distal amino and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          lerisetron, we constructed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
          3AS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rs</ENAMEX> containing mutations at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX>,
          R91, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> inhibition of [
          3H]-granisetron binding by lerisetron on wildtype and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. For most amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, an alanine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> was constructed in order to effectively
          remove any amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> interaction with the ligand. For
          W89, an alanine substitution has been shown to prevent
          binding of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>; therefore a less severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> was constructed.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">W89F</NUMEX> mutation produces a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-fold change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-granisetron binding (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ±
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 nM</TIMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the W89Y</TIMEX> mutation produces a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8</NUMEX>-fold change in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.7 ± 0.7 nM</NUMEX>). Mutation of amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid R91</ENAMEX> to alanine produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron binding (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.9</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.7 nM</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These data agree well with previously
          reported values [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Alanine mutations at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tyrosine</ENAMEX> positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX> also produced
          minor increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron binding (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX> nM, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5 ± 0.5 nM and 7.8 ± 1.1 nM</NUMEX> respectively) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Only small changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for lerisetron were observed for the
          Y140A mutation while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y142A and Y152A</TIMEX> mutations
          produced large increases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89F</TIMEX> and
          W89Y, the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i observed for lerisetron were much
          smaller than for the alanine mutations at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142A</TIMEX> and
          Y152A, as would be expected for the less severe nature of
          these mutations. The changes were, however significant (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX> in both cases) and are similar to the changes
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d reported for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>. The
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">W89F mutant receptor</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX>
          ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX> fold and the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">W89Y receptor</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>
          fold. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R91A</NUMEX> mutant produced an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.6 ± 1.5</NUMEX> fold as compared to the
          wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. These data indicated potential
          interactions of lerisetron with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R91</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y142</ENAMEX> and
          Y152.
        
        
          Mutation of W89
          As mentioned above, the lack of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-granisetron
          binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">W89A mutant receptors</ENAMEX> necessitated the use of
          W89F and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">W89Y</ENAMEX> mutations to analyze functional group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. The effects of these mutations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for analogs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> are shown in
          figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Cand Table 1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analog</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> inhibited [
          3H]-granisetron binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">W89F receptors</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">170 ± 54 nM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 ± 3.2</NUMEX> fold
          increase, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">W89Y receptors</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81 ± 14 nM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2 ± 0.6</NUMEX> fold
          increase, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). This reflects a significant
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i and reflects a potential interaction
          of analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX>. The strength of this interaction is
          apparently similar to the strength of the interaction
          with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-granisetron and lerisetron since the magnitude
          of the change is similar in both cases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analog 2</ENAMEX> also
          showed a significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i as a result of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the W89F</TIMEX> and W89Y
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. The magnitude of the change for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89F</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.1</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> fold, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) was similar to that observed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lerisetron</ENAMEX> and analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">W89Y</NUMEX> mutation produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.8</NUMEX>
          ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> fold change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> appear to form similar interactions with
          W89.
        
        
          Mutation of R91
          Mutation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">R91</NUMEX> to alanine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R91A</NUMEX>) resulted in a
          significant, but small increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for lerisetron of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.6 ± 1.5</NUMEX> fold (p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Dshows</NUMEX> the inhibition of [
          3H]-granisetron binding by analogs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R91A</NUMEX> mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. No significant change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i was observed on these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for
          either analog 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9 ± 0.28</NUMEX> fold) or analog 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.56</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX> fold) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) as compared to the wildtype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Mutation of Y142
          Mutation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Y142</NUMEX> to alanine produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
          largest observed changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for lerisetron (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i obtained for lerisetron was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          nM, reflecting a change of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> fold compared to
          wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i value for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, in contrast,
          increased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only 6.8 ± 2.3</NUMEX> fold (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) as a result
          of this mutation (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Eand Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> showed a similar change
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 ± 0.77</NUMEX> fold (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). While these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values are significantly different
          from wildtype values for each analog, the lack of larger
          effects suggests that neither analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nor analog 2 bind
          as strongly as lerisetron to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Mutation of Y152
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y152A</NUMEX> mutation showed the most variability in its
          effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values for lerisetron, analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> 2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Fand Table 1</ENAMEX>). Lerisetron
          inhibited [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-granisetron binding with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>; an increase of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> fold compared to wildtype values. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i value for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">± 3.2 nM</NUMEX> (wildtype) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 ± 0.40 μM</NUMEX>. This change of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> fold is slightly smaller, but not significantly
          different from the relative change observed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lerisetron</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.08 μM</NUMEX> on wildtype to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 ± 4.2 μM</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152A</TIMEX> mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 ± 12</NUMEX> fold increase). The increase observed
          for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was significantly less than that observed
          for both lerisetron and analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The smaller change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          
          i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> suggests that analog 2
          binds weakly to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX> while lerisetron and analog 1 bind
          more tightly.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Functional group interactions of W89
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">W89F</NUMEX> mutation produced a significant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          
          i for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> compounds. The
          magnitude of the change was similar in all cases. In
          addition, the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i was identical to the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d that has been observed for [
          3H]granisetron binding on this mutant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alterations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i resulting from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the W89Y</TIMEX> mutation
          were slightly less, however the change was again the same
          for lerisetron, analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. These data suggest
          that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> compounds form binding site interactions
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX>. The interaction between lerisetron and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">W89</ENAMEX> is
          unlikely to be via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> since
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was also altered by
          this mutation. The same argument can be made for the
          distal piperazine nitrogen since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> also increased. The
          portion of the molecule common to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> compounds,
          the aromatic benzimidazole, is thus the most likely point
          of interaction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Functional group interactions of R91
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R91A</NUMEX> mutation increased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i value for lerisetron inhibition of [
          3H]granisetron binding by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX> fold. This is a moderately
          small change for an alanine mutation, particularly
          considering that the smallest change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for removal of a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lerisetron</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> fold. It is
          therefore likely that this interaction is either
          extremely weak or the change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i is the result of a structural change
          in the binding site. Previous studies concluded that R91
          was an important interaction for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R agonist 5-hydroxytryptamine
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-HT</ENAMEX>), since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT inhibition increased over
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> fold as a result of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R91A</NUMEX> mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . A
          change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]granisetron binding to R91A
          was also observed. In order to determine whether the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl or distal piperazine nitrogen of lerisetron was
          involved in an interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R91</TIMEX>, we tested both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">R91A mutant receptors</ENAMEX>. No change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i was observed for either compound.
          This result makes it much more difficult to assign the
          correct functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to this amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> since it
          suggests that one or both of the compounds is no longer
          binding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in precisely the same manner as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lerisetron</ENAMEX>. Considering the small change observed for
          lerisetron binding as a result of this mutation, even a
          slight reorientation of the molecule in the binding site
          could result in the loss of this interaction.
        
        
          Functional group interactions of Y142
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values for inhibition of [
          3H]granisetron binding by analogs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> were altered
          only slightly by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y142A</TIMEX> mutation. The magnitude of the
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for lerisetron, however, was
          considerably larger (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> fold) and is indicative of an
          important interaction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX>. The lack
          of a large change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for both analogs makes it difficult
          to interpret this data since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both of the compounds
          appears to be interacting differently with the binding
          site than lerisetron.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analogs 1 and 2</ENAMEX> differ from each other both in the
          functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> contained in the molecule and their
          structural similarity to lerisetron. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analog 2</ENAMEX> is most
          similar in overall structure. The substitution of oxygen
          for the distal amino nitrogen alters the potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> formed at this position, but is likely to
          have a small effect on the overall size and shape of the
          molecule. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analog 1</ENAMEX> is far less similar to lerisetron and
          more similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R antagonist granisetron. Previous
          studies have shown that the binding of granisetron is not
          affected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Y142A</TIMEX> mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analog</ENAMEX> 1 may bind
          more similar to granisetron than lerisetron and thus
          would be unaffected by mutations at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX>. This is less
          likely to be the case with analog 2.
          The strength of the putative interaction at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Y142</ENAMEX> can
          be identified by examining the change in binding of
          lerisetron as a result of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y142A</NUMEX> mutation. The Y142A
          mutation produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> fold change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i . This change reflects the binding
          energy lost as a result of the alanine substitution. The
          observed change in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ki</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wt receptors</ENAMEX> is much larger than
          that observed for removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          fold), but is similar to that observed for substitution
          of the distal amino nitrogen in analog 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> fold).
          Taken together with the close structural similarity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to lerisetron, it can be concluded that
          comparison of analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and lerisetron should provide the
          best means of identifying the interaction at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX>. No
          change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i was observed for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> as a
          result of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y142A</NUMEX> mutation indicating a lack of any
          significant interaction of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142</TIMEX>. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> support our hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y142</ENAMEX> interacts with the
          distal piperazine nitrogen of lerisetron. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> may also be involved since the change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for lerisetron binding as a result
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y142A</NUMEX> mutation was smaller than the change
          produced by substitution of the piperazine nitrogen. As
          described below, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Functional group interactions of Y152
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y152A</NUMEX> mutation produced increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> compounds although the
          magnitude of the change differed. The increases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> fold for lerisetron,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> fold for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and only 40</NUMEX> fold for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Thus,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog 1</ENAMEX> retains much of its ability to interact with
          Y152 despite the absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> interacts more weakly with this amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>.
          Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for analog 1 is increased by the
          Y152A mutation, it is unlikely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl group
          interacts with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX>. The small change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> supports a partial
          interaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX> with the distal piperazine nitrogen
          although some interaction with another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is also
          apparent. This other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would be expected to be in
          close proximity to the distal nitrogen. The most likely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> is the other nitrogen of the piperazine ring.
          Thus Y152A may form a partial interaction with both
          piperazine nitrogens.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Figure 6shows a hypothetical model of the
        lerisetron-binding site supported by our observations. The
        model illustrates the secondary structure of the region of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y140 - Y152</TIMEX> in a loop configuration. This
        structure is supported by site-directed mutagenesis data [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] as well as structural predictions obtained from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LGIC receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . The recent determination of the
        structure of a nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine binding protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
        ] that shares significant homology with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGIC</ENAMEX> family
        also supports a loop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89 through Y93</TIMEX> is shown as a β-sheet as
        has been hypothesized based on site-directed mutagenesis
        studies of this strand of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Our data indicate the
        functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of lerisetron that may interact with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX>,
        R91, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y142 and Y152</TIMEX>.
        W89 is shown interacting with the aromatic benzimidazole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of lerisetron although the precise position of W89
        relative to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is not known. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">W89</NUMEX> interaction
        with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is supported by the observed increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for lerisetron, analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and analog 2.
        Since the benzimidazole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is common to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        compounds it is the most likely point of interaction. W89
        also represents a common interaction in the binding site
        for both lerisetron and [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">granisetron</ENAMEX>.
        Y142 is shown interacting with the distal piperazine
        nitrogen possibly through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cation-π interaction</ENAMEX>. This
        orientation of an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> interacting with an aromatic
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cation-π interaction</ENAMEX> has been shown for the
        nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine receptor</ENAMEX> and has been hypothesized
        for many LGIC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30 26</NUMEX> ] . This conclusion
        is based on both the magnitude of the change observed on
        the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for removal of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400</ENAMEX>
        fold) compared to the effect of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y142A</NUMEX> mutation on
        lerisetron binding (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> fold) and the lack of any major
        change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> as a result of this
        mutation. Our data does not support an interaction of this
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> with either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl or benzimidazole
        portions of lerisetron.
        Y152 is shown positioned between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> piperazine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nitrogens</ENAMEX>. This conclusion is supported by the smaller
        increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for analog 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> fold) compared to
        that observed for lerisetron (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> fold). These results
        suggest a partial interaction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y152</TIMEX> with the distal
        piperazine nitrogen. Since some change was observed, a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> interaction is also likely. The functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in
        closest proximity to the distal piperazine nitrogen is the
        other nitrogen on the piperazine ring. Another possibility
        would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-benzyl interaction, however, since the Y152A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> also produced a large increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        i for analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, this conclusion is not
        supported by our data.
        R91 is shown as interacting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        This is a difficult conclusion to make considering the
        small effect of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R91A</NUMEX> mutation on lerisetron binding.
        The interaction is included in the model based on
        structural information obtained from the crystal structure
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The region of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homologous to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loop E</ENAMEX> and loop D of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3A receptor</ENAMEX> suggests a loop structure
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from Y140</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Y152</NUMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-residue turn containing a glycine
        at position 147 and the β-strand from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89</TIMEX> through Y93
        oriented as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The orientation of
        lerisetron between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W89 and Y142A</TIMEX> as shown would enable the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to be positioned in close proximity to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R91</TIMEX>.
        If this is the case, then a small alteration in position of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX> in the binding site could result in the loss
        of this presumably weak interaction. The apparent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in the binding site location of analog 1 would
        be consistent with this hypothesis. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX> hypothesis
        would place the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in a different position,
        interacting with another amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>; either solely or in
        concert with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R91</TIMEX>.
        Our data support a binding site for lerisetron on the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R that spans the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and E loop regions.

        L102, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R104</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">M114</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These amino
        acids form a cluster in the proposed acetylcholine binding
        domain of AChBP similar to that proposed in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Both
        loops have been identified on the complementary face of the
        binding site of the nAChR. It is unknown if lerisetron
        utilizes amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> on the principal face although none
        have been identified. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> for lerisetron binding will
        be further refined as its interactions with other binding
        site amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are investigated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 32 33</NUMEX> ] . Of
        particular interest would be potential interactions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-benzyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that would account for the decrease in
        binding affinity of analog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Additional information gained
        from comparison of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with the recent crystal
        structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> demonstrates that lerisetron can be
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> 'fit' into the binding site such that all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues</ENAMEX> line up as shown in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. While this is not
        direct evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is correct, subsequent
        molecular modeling of the data presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> may
        provide further support for our hypothesis. Our current
        model provides an initial working hypothesis that can form
        the basis of further investigation. Also, while it is
        unclear whether the information obtained in this study can
        be extended to other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R ligands, a similar approach would be
        useful in identifying functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> interactions for
        mCPBG, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT, dtC and granisetron.
