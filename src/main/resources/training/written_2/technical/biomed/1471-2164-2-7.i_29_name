        Tropomodulins are the vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that cap the
        pointed ends of filamentous actin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The first 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tropomodulin</ENAMEX> (TMOD) gene was cloned
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) from a fetal liver <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> additional family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have been identified in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMOD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> have been identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, chick, 
        Drosophila, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Expression patterns vary extensively: 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropomodulin</ENAMEX> 3 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TMOD3</NUMEX>) is ubiquitous;
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropomodulin</ENAMEX> 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TMOD1</NUMEX>) is widespread
        in heart, muscle, brain, lens, erythrocytes, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterioles</ENAMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropomodulin</ENAMEX> 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TMOD2</NUMEX>) is restricted
        to neuronal tissue; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropomodulin</ENAMEX> 4 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TMOD4</NUMEX>). is expressed
        in skeletal muscle, with a less abundant <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~7</NUMEX> kb transcript
        expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Whereas tropomodulins or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arp 2/3</ENAMEX> complex cap the
        pointed end of actin filaments, the barbed end can be
        capped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CapZ, α</ENAMEX>, β, and γ adducins as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gelsolin</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> of thin filament length is critical for
        maintaining proper sarcomere function and length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Inhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tmod1</TIMEX>'s capping activity - either by using an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end or by decreasing expression
        using an antisense 
        Tmod1 transcript - results in
        elongated thin filaments and decreased cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contractility</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . 
        Tmod1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> in rat
        cardiomyocytes causes shortening of the thin filaments and
        sarcomere disorganization, resulting in myofibril
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> overexpressing 
        TMOD1 in the heart show disrupted
        sarcomere <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with shortened thin filaments,
        leading to myofibril degeneration and dilated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiomyopathy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Littlefield</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> showed that overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Tmod1</ENAMEX> in chick
        cardiac myocytes results in shortening of thin filaments;
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> proposed that excess Tmod1 decreases the
        affinity between actin monomers and pointed ends, leading
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer dissociation</ENAMEX> and filament shortening [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
        Mutations in many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> making up the cardiac sarcomere
        have been shown to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac hypertrophy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX>
        ] :mutations in the 
        TPM1 gene, for example, cause type 3
        familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CMH3</NUMEX>), and a
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> expressing a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CMH3</NUMEX> mutation develops
        ventricular myocyte disarray and hypertrophy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Mutations in myosin heavy chain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> are estimated to account
        for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-50%</NUMEX> of the cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Given the importance of actin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, we mapped 
        TMOD2 and 
        TMOD4 and found them to localize to
        15q21.1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1q12</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . These loci overlap
        with the genomic regions containing the genes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</ENAMEX> 5 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ALS5</NUMEX>) and limb girdle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">muscular dystrophy</ENAMEX> 1B (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LGMD1B</NUMEX>), respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . We
        characterized these tropomodulin genomic loci for use in
        mutational analysis. During the course of this study, the
        gene mutated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LGMD1B</TIMEX> was identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lamin A</ENAMEX>/C [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        Our investigation, however, revealed that an unrelated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX>, intergenically spliced into 
        TMOD4 . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> is a putative
        transformation suppressor gene that localizes to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> and binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> is organized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> exons and
        produces several alternatively spliced transcripts using
        both intergenic and cryptic splicing. This relationship
        between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and 
        TMOD4 serves as yet another example
        of the complexity of genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and gene
        regulation.
      
      
        Results
        
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TMOD2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TMOD4</TIMEX>, and
          YL-1
          We determined the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron boundaries of 
          TMOD2 and 
          TMOD4 by sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          amplified from primers within adjacent exons, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX> short exon containing genomic fragments. We
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> coding exons in 
          TMOD2 and in 
          TMOD4 which are spread over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> kb
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX> kb genomic region, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
          exon/intron boundaries of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are conserved,
          except that 
          TMOD2 has more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated
          region (UTR) in coding exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and more 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 9</TIMEX> than 
          TMOD4. TMOD2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TMOD4</ENAMEX> also contain
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exons. Our reported cDNAs have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">19 bp additional sequence 5</TIMEX>' to what is contained in exon
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for each gene, respectively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . A search of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX>
          database using the 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5</ENAMEX>' end extended this sequence
          by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 bp</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AA194560</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AA192772</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AA178988</ENAMEX>). We were
          able to align this sequence and found that it lies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1006</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> from 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 1</ENAMEX> and contained a
          consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> splice site. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' rapid amplification
          of cDNA ends (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RACE</ENAMEX>) from 
          TMOD4 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 2</TIMEX>, we discovered that
          this exon was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">93 bp</NUMEX> in length and contained no consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> acceptor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' RACE from 
          TMOD4 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 2</TIMEX> extended our reported
          cDNA by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 9</NUMEX> bp, bringing the entire length of
          the 
          TMOD4 transcript to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.267</NUMEX> kb
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genbank Accession# AF393374</ENAMEX>).
          Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the 
          TMOD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>, we searched the high
          throughput genomic sequences (HTGS) database and
          identified a sequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NT 010204</ENAMEX>, that contained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          identity to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> basepairs of 
          TMOD2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> and contained a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consensus GT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> splice site. The distance from this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exon to coding exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.6</NUMEX> kb, but the sequence is
          not completely ordered. Using nomenclature from previous
          tropomodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> we designated these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exons as E0
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          We sought to determine the genomic structure of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> when we discovered that it
          lies next to and intergenically splices into 
          TMOD4 (see below). Using the same
          methods described above, we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> coding exons
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> spanning <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14.2 kb</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
          distance from the last exon of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> to E0 
          TMOD4 is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291 bp.</ENAMEX> We sequenced the
          entire genomic region encompassing 
          TMOD4 from the end of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1 exon 6</ENAMEX> through 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 9</ENAMEX> and deposited it in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Accession No. AF393375</ENAMEX>). The sizes of the exons
          and introns as well as the boundary sequences for 
          TMOD2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TMOD4</TIMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> are provided (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Consensus splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were identified for all 
          Tropomodulin exons, but 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">exon</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> contained a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splice</ENAMEX> site instead of the more common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice site.
          This splice site also conforms well to other nonconsensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice sites as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
          at the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+5</NUMEX> positions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . We used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the very 3</TIMEX>'
          end of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> cDNA to look for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">additional 3</TIMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AA128103</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AW627363</TIMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AI591193</ENAMEX>) that were identical at the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end and extended the reported
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 150</NUMEX> bp.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutational Analysis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMOD2</ENAMEX> in ALS5
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> controls from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with an
          autosomal recessive form of familial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALS</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ALS5</NUMEX>) were
          analyzed for mutations in 
          TMOD2. We amplified coding exons
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-9</ENAMEX> using primers flanking each exon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were sequenced to identify any potential
          point mutations or small deletions. We did not detect any
          mutations or polymorphisms in any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or
          controls.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX> genic splicing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> into TMOD4
          During our analysis of 
          TMOD4's genomic structure we
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">identified EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AI763406</TIMEX>, which contains 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 9</ENAMEX> and part of the coding
          region of another unrelated gene known as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX>. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' RACE we were able to
          confirm the presence of this transcript and identify
          other unique intergenic RACE products. Figure 2summarizes
          our findings. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main intergenic products,
          each of which was represented multiple times in our RACE
          clones. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intergenic splice products (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RACE #9-11</ENAMEX>,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-15</NUMEX>) are similar to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AI763406</TIMEX>. These variants
          consist of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-5</ENAMEX>, and 
          TMOD4 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 9</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> of this
          splice variant keeps the reading frame of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> but changes the 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endogenous</ENAMEX> reading frame to
          make the reading frame of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> completely open.
          Translation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> would theoretically produce a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 271</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> containing the amino
          terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> but a unique carboxy terminus.
          If, however, we extend the sequence to include intronic
          sequence downstream of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, we discover that the frame
          is kept open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional 45 bp</TIMEX>, making this theoretical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein 286</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length. Using primers to exon
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of 
          TMOD4, we confirmed the presence of
          this intergenic product by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> on human heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
          RACE product <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#12</NUMEX> was similar to RACE products <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-15</NUMEX> except that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> splices from exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 8</ENAMEX> which then splices to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> 9 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This produces an ORF coding for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">252</NUMEX>
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX> that changes the frame of 
          TMOD4, adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 16</NUMEX> additional
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> before encountering a stop codon. Another set
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RACE products</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RACE # 1-5</ENAMEX>) consists of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX> and 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-9</ENAMEX>, except that exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          uses an internal consensus cryptic splice site. Using the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> endogenous frame we find that
          this ORF terminates in 
          TMOD4 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1</TIMEX>. If we assume an ORF
          including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> along with the
          isolated RACE product, then it would theoretically
          produce a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. We used the
          translated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> from these intergenic ORFs
          and analyzed them using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro Scan</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EXPASY</ENAMEX>. No
          additional sequence motifs or domains were identified.
          Another type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RACE product</ENAMEX> we identified (RACE<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 26-31</NUMEX>)
          is the incompletely spliced products of 
          TMOD4. In no case did we observe
          the inclusion of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1 exon 6</ENAMEX> or the use of the
          normal splice acceptor of 
          TMOD4 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exon 2</NUMEX> - the cryptic splice
          acceptor was always present in intergenic RACE products.
          Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1</ENAMEX> alpha helical domain, which is
          thought to contain the DNA binding domain, is maintained
          in all intergenic splice products contained within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> intraexonic spliced transcripts and expression
          pattern
          To better understand the nature of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX>'s intergenic splicing, we
          searched <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> database for other alternative and
          intergenic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> transcripts. Using either the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> or 
          TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> in a BLAST search of
          the human <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> database, we were unable to identify any
          additional intergenic transcripts, but we did uncover
          several 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1 ESTs</ENAMEX> that had apparently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spliced</ENAMEX> within exons in such a way as to not use the
          canonical consensus splice acceptors or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, the rarer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> or AT donor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX> acceptor site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AI560960</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AI369608</ENAMEX> were identical and contained 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> but splice
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 2</TIMEX> at position 276 (position is in bp relative
          to Genbank sequence D43642) to position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1107</TIMEX> (internal to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 6</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Translation of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> would produce a
          truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 121</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> AI560960
          was obtained from the IMAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> and sequenced. It
          is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">476 bp</NUMEX> in length and contains 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1 exons 1</ENAMEX> and up to position 276
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 2</TIMEX> at which it splices internal to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> at
          position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1107</TIMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> splice product was represented by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AI366716</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AW005187</ENAMEX>, in which the sequence appears
          to splice from position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> at
          position 936 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This would produce another
          truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length.
          Another unusual splice product was represented by ESTs
          AA443950 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AA653180</TIMEX>. These ESTs demonstrate splicing
          within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> itself, from position
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">936 to 1062</TIMEX> (skipping over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~126 bp</NUMEX>), changing the frame
          and making it open past the endogenous stop codon (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AA443950</TIMEX> was obtained from the image consortium
          and sequenced. It contained a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1199</TIMEX> bp insert which
          contained all of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-5</ENAMEX> and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> as
          described above and encodes an ORF for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">358</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. However, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AA653180</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional six</NUMEX> base
          pairs at the splice junction site coding for leucine and
          proline, suggesting that either the site produces <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX>
          different splice variants or there is some type of
          intermediate stage of splicing at this site. In either
          case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> produced from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> (if AA653180
          contains the rest of the intact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> transcript) would be 360 amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. This truncates the reported 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1 protein</ENAMEX> only by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro Scan</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EXPASY</ENAMEX>, we determined that
          these few amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> do not produce any potential
          phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> or motifs. Two
          of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> splice variants use the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">936</NUMEX> position for
          splicing as a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case and as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptor</ENAMEX> in the other. We cannot explain this finding,
          but it may suggest that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> undergoes a great degree of
          intraexonic splicing. This high degree of splicing
          together with the lack of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> site in the last
          exon, and the close proximity of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and 
          TMOD4, may account for the
          intergenic splicing between these genes.
          We also wanted to determine whether the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> expression pattern overlapped
          with 
          TMOD4. A human multiple tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern blot</ENAMEX> was probed with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1 RT-PCR</ENAMEX> product revealing a
          single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> kb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in all lanes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This is
          consistent with the reported ubiquitous expression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> PCR fragments and genomic subclones from
        phage artificial chromosomes (PACs) and bacterial
        artificial chromosomes (BACs) that 
        contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TMOD2</ENAMEX> and 
        TMOD4 allowed us to determine the
        genomic structure of these two 
        Tropomodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Although
        mutational analysis of the coding region of 
        TMOD2 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALS5</TIMEX> and 
        TMOD4 in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LGMD1B</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> failed to
        reveal any point mutations, small deletions, or
        polymorphisms, we did find that 
        TMOD2 and 
        TMOD4 consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> coding exons
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated exon (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E0</NUMEX>).
        This is identical to the genomic structure reported for 
        TMOD1 and 
        Tmod1 by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conley et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 41</NUMEX> ] . In addition, they identified an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">86 bp 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exon which was expressed in a tissue-specific
        manner. We performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' RACE for 
        TMOD4 and identified only a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp 5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exon (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E0</NUMEX>) which lies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1006</TIMEX> bp from coding exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        We did not examine whether the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E0</NUMEX> exons of 
        TMOD2 and 
        TMOD4 were expressed in a
        tissue-specific manner. In addition, the 
        TMOD2 transcript is approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kb in length and our reported cDNA only accounts for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kb</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, there are additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exons
        or sequence that we have not identified in this study. This
        may not be the case for 
        TMOD4, because our reported cDNA in
        addition to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">93</TIMEX> base pairs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E0</TIMEX> sequence and the
        additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 bp</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end produces a transcript of
        the same size as the major transcript seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>.
        However, the larger transcripts (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4 and 3.0 kb</NUMEX>) seen on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> may contain additional sequence that we were
        unable to identify in this study, or may represent
        incompletely spliced transcripts.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> database searches in conjunction with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> genomic structure allowed us to
        identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> unique intraexonic splicing events. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> events theoretically would produce truncated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with little similarity to the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        These splicing events do not use the canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> and GT
        splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, nor do they use the rarer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>, AT, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
        splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. This may represent yet another form of
        splicing for the creation of unique transcripts and, or
        gene regulation.
        We also identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intergenic transcripts between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and 
        TMOD4, both of which theoretically
        would code for truncated versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX>. Intergenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX> appears to be a rare event: apparently there have
        been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> other cases reported in mammals. Fears 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) reported that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myelodysplasia</ENAMEX> syndrome 1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MDS1</NUMEX>) gene
        spliced into exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the adjacent 
        Ecotropic viral integration site
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EVI1</NUMEX>) gene, producing a unique transcript containing
        an ORF that produces a GATA-binding transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . The human 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Galactose-1-phosphate uridylytransferase</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GALT</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> produces an intergenic transcript by
        skipping its last exon and splicing into exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of 
        Interleukin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> receptor α-chain
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-11Rα</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . This produces an intergenic
        transcript that keeps the endogenous frame of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
        thereby coding for a theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with domains from
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A long terminal repeat from a human
        endogenous retrovirus (HERV) was shown to drive the
        expression of an intergenic transcript from an unknown gene
        named 
        HERV-HLTR associating 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HHLA1</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> 
        otoconin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">OC90</NUMEX>) to produce a
        transcript that is highly expressed in teratocarcinoma
        cells but not in normal human tissues or cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
        . In the mouse, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prion</ENAMEX>-like downstream gene named 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doppel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dpl</ENAMEX>) was found to have an
        intergenic transcript that is upregulated in
        Prion-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The deletion of the Prion
        gene in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> removes the splice acceptor site of exon
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, causing the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prion</ENAMEX> transcript to skip the deleted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> and inadvertently upregulate the normally
        low-abundance intergenic transcript by forcing it to splice
        more often to the 
        doppel gene. The human cytochrome
        P450 2C gene cluster maps to chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10q24</NUMEX> and consists
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genes which are composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> exons with
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX>/intron boundaries, and have been shown to
        produce intergenic transcripts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . These
        transcripts have been identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> for both
        neighboring genes such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CYP2C18 and CYP2C19</TIMEX>, as well as
        CYP2C <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> separated by another gene, such as CYP2C18
        and CYP2C8 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . The latter was shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> to
        include exons from both genes consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> and
        therefore could code for a chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CYP2C protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        Recently, the 
        Translin-associated factor <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> gene
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAX</ENAMEX>) was demonstrated to intergenically splice into 
        Disrupted in schizophrenia gene 1
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISCI</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Several intergenic transcripts were
        described, the majority of which contain intervening
        non-coding exons that contain multiple stop codons.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least half</NUMEX> of the reported cases of intergenic
        splicing result from skipping the last exon of the upstream
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> exon of the downstream gene [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 39</NUMEX> ]
        . This is thought to be due to the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and
        acceptor splice sites in these exons, respectively. For 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> there is no GT donor site
        at the end of the exon, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E0</NUMEX> exon of 
        TMOD4 contains no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> acceptor. Thus
        the same pattern seen in the other reported intergenic
        splicing events is born out in our studies. This idea is
        supported by the fact that we never identified any part of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E0</NUMEX> exon in our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RACE products</ENAMEX> screened using the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>. However, we did discover
        this product when we rescreened our RACE products using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TMOD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. Of the previously
        reported cases, the closest distance between adjacent genes
        is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and 
        TMOD4 are separated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">291 bp</TIMEX>. Since
        this genomic region is so small, it raises the question as
        to the location of the 
        TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is
        that it lies within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1006 bp between the E0</TIMEX> exon and
        coding exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, or even within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 291 bp</TIMEX> between the E0
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1 exon 6</ENAMEX>. A more intriguing
        possibility is that the 
        TMOD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> lies further upstream,
        possibly within the intronic structure of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX>, or as a shared <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX>. 
        Whether these intergenic splice products are
        biologically relevant is unclear. Due to the fact that the
        size of the transcripts for 
        TMOD4 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> overlap (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> kb), we
        cannot demonstrate the co-existence of these intergenic
        variants by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis. The only reported case
        in which an intergenic transcript has been shown to produce
        a functional protein 
        in vivo is the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MDS1/EVI1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        ] . In all other cases, the intergenic transcript or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">theoretical protein</ENAMEX> produced from such transcripts has been
        difficult to demonstrate by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis, and
        none have been shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> analysis in normal tissues.
        However, all of these transcripts have been identified by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and some by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RNase</ENAMEX> protection assays. Thus, further
        analysis will be needed to determine if any of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YL-1/TMOD4</ENAMEX> intergenic transcripts
        play an important biological role either at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Through our genomic analysis we were able to determine
        that 
        TMOD2 and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, like 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TMOD1/Tmod1</ENAMEX>, share conserved genomic
        structures consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> coding exons and a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> exon (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E0</NUMEX>). Using primers flanking the coding exons of 
        TMOD2 we performed mutational
        analysis on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ALS5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. No mutations or polymorphisms
        were detected, but our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> pairs and reaction conditions
        may prove useful for future mutational analyses. We
        determined that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YL-1</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> exons, and its
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last exon</TIMEX> lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">291 bp</NUMEX> from 
        TMOD4. We also identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> ESTs
        that show nonconventional splicing. Intergenic splice
        products between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and 
        TMOD4 were identified in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' RACE, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. Although we did not
        determine whether this relationship between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and 
        TMOD4 is conserved in the mouse, it
        may be an important possibility to consider when devising
        strategies for targeted deletion not only of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> or 
        TMOD4 but any gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in which
        intergenic splicing occurs. This is clearly illustrated by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Prion deficient mice</ENAMEX> produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sakaguchi et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1996) and Moore</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). In these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and its
        splice acceptor were deleted, causing a rare intergenic
        transcript between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prion</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doppel</ENAMEX> to be highly upregulated and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormally</ENAMEX> expressed in the brain, leading to late-onset
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ataxia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Purkinje</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> degeneration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        The recent completion of the human genome by Ventner 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) has led to the new
        prediction that the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only ~</NUMEX>30,000
        genes, significantly lower than previous estimates of
        ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . This estimate does not, however,
        include the possibility of additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by
        alternative or intergenic transcripts. The genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX> and 
        TMOD4 clearly raises the possibility
        of additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> being produced from intergenic
        transcripts. In addition, it highlights the difficulties
        that may arise when trying to understand gene regulation
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that lie extremely close to one another or that
        form intergenic transcripts. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YL-1</ENAMEX>'s intraexonic splicing
        illustrates yet another level of genomic complexity in that
        alternative transcripts could be produced from the use of
        non-canonical splice sites that lie even within an
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>. This, in conjunction with intergenic
        splicing, may significantly increase the number of
        predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> and will
        certainly pose a challenge for anyone trying to decipher
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and regulation.

          The genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of each gene was determined
          using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> involved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification
          from either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> 61J10 (for 
          TMOD2 ) or BAC HB342I3 (for 
          TMOD4 and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> to amplify the exon and the intervening intron and
          use it as a substrate for sequencing the exon-intron
          boundaries. We also digested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> 61J10 (from the RPCI-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC library</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roswell Park Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>) and BAC

          fragments into pZero <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX> according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          instructions. We screened <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> by hybridization using
          the cDNA for each gene as a probe. All labeling reactions
          for all procedures were performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megaprime</ENAMEX> DNA
          labeling system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia Biotech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piscataway</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). Positive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were isolated and sequenced using
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle</ENAMEX> sequencing kit and an ABI
