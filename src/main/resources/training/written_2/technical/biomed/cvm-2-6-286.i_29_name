        plaque debris and thrombus, complicate percutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coronary</ENAMEX> and peripheral interventions more often than had
        been recognized until recently. This often results in
        diminished blood flow to the distal vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bed and</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with periprocedural end-organ ischemia and
        infarction, as demonstrated by perfusion defects and serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac enzyme elevation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Periprocedural myocardial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarction</ENAMEX> (MI) is associated with a worse prognosis,
        particularly when it is large, which is most clearly
        demonstrated in saphenous vein bypass graft interventions.
        This was demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">et al.</ENAMEX> who studied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1056</TIMEX> consecutive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with angiographically successful percutaneous
        coronary intervention of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1693</TIMEX> SVG <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One-year</ENAMEX>
        mortality was significantly increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">periprocedural creatine kinase-MB</ENAMEX> elevation, even among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without any apparent procedure or in-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        complication.
        Distal embolization of large particles at the time of
        balloon inflation or stent deployment may obstruct large,
        epicardial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, but the scope of the problem includes
        microvascular obstruction due to very small particles, as
        little as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-100</NUMEX> microns, that may result in microinfarcts
        and left ventricular dysfunction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. It is likely that
        mechanical microvascular obstruction is commonly aggravated
        by secondary spasm and edema due to release of humoral
        agonists by platelets, and endothelial injury and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX>. Limited therapeutic success has been reported
        from observational studies involving the use of calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> blockers, adenosine, and sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitroprusside</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        However, the success of these medical interventions is most
        commonly defined by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">angiographic</TIMEX> resolution of the
        "no-reflow" phenomenon (an acute reduction in coronary flow
        less than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrombolysis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myocardial Infarction</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIMI</ENAMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in
        the absence of dissection, thrombus, spasm, or high-grade
        residual stenosis at the original target lesion). A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effect on hard clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">endpoints</ENAMEX> has been more
        difficult to prove.

        coronary intervention
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glycoprotein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> reduce not only
        procedural infarctions, but also major adverse clinical
        events in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing percutaneous coronary
        intervention. The benefit is thought to be, in part, due to
        a reduction in the incidence of ischemic complications,
        which is likely to be secondary to prevention of platelet
        aggregation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thrombus</ENAMEX> formation, and distal embolization,
        in native coronary arteries [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. These benefits, however,
        have been apparent in subset analyses of clinical trials,
        or in observational studies designed to specifically assess
        their efficacy in saphenous vein graft interventions.
        Despite suggestion of benefit as measured by surrogate
        angiographic endpoints, there is no evidence of a
        consistent and sustained meaningful clinical benefit [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. The likely explanation for this apparent lack of
        benefit in vein graft interventions, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> clearly reduce procedural infarctions by
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX>, is the difference in the composition of
        the embolic material. Distal embolization during saphenous
        vein graft intervention is predominantly due to soft
        acellular atheromatous material typically found under the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrous</ENAMEX> cap (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol clefts</ENAMEX>, lipid-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX>,
        and fibrin material) that occurs in ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of
        interventions on vein grafts that are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three years</TIMEX>
        old [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predictors</ENAMEX> of distal embolization
        include diffuse degeneration and large plaque volume rather
        than thrombus, and angioscopy studies have found that vein
        graft friability, rather than thrombus, was a stronger
        predictor of distal embolization and 'no-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reflow</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>].
        The relative contribution of platelet aggregates or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atheromatous</ENAMEX> material to distal embolization and vessel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occlusion</ENAMEX> in native coronary arteries is unclear. Despite
        these aforementioned beneficial effects of aggressive
        platelet inhibition during percutaneous coronary
        intervention, however, further reductions in distal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embolization</ENAMEX> remains an important goal, particularly in the
        acute coronary syndromes.
      
      
        Percutaneous carotid interventions
        Percutaneous carotid interventions are frequently
        complicated by embolization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> and others have demonstrated
        that there is Doppler evidence of microembolization during
        almost all carotid stenting procedures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The precise
        clinical significance of this phenomenon remains unclear,
        since the brain appears to have a surprising tolerance for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microembolization</ENAMEX> in the acute setting. No one has yet
        linked these emboli to adverse clinical events. However,
        even small plaque fragments <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 200</NUMEX> microns may cause
        neuronal ischemia at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points, and periprocedural
        microemboli may be responsible for both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and more
        subtle neurologic dysfunction in late follow-up [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>].
        Carotid angioplasty and stenting is associated with a
        perioperative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> rate exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> in most series,
        largely due to emboli. Additionally, this embolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complication</ENAMEX> continues to limit the applicability of
        percutaneous revascularization in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are suitable
        for surgical carotid endarterectomy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Balloon occlusion devices: PercuSurge
        GuardWire
        A number of distal protection devices that aim to reduce
        or eliminate distal embolization during percutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coronary</ENAMEX> and carotid interventions are under development
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> such device has already been approved for use
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PercuSurge GuardWire</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medtronic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Rosa</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
        is an occlusion thrombectomy device that consists of a wire
        containing a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lumen</ENAMEX> that communicates with a
        low-pressure distal occlusion balloon incorporated into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tip</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The wire serves as both the angioplasty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidewire</ENAMEX> and provides protection from distal embolization.
        An inflation device allows controlled expansion and sizing
        of the occlusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX> in the treated vessel. An
        aspiration catheter is used to remove the debris from the
        treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX> is deflated and antegrade
        flow in the treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> is restored.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saphenous Vein Graft Angioplasty Free</ENAMEX> of Emboli
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAFE</ENAMEX>) study evaluated the safety and feasibility of this
        device [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Initial encouraging results in the European
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">registries</ENAMEX> were confirmed in the Saphenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vein Graft Angioplasty Free of Emboli, Randomized</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAFER</ENAMEX>)
        trial conducted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAFER</ENAMEX>
        trial was conducted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and enrolled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">659</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        undergoing saphenous vein graft percutaneous coronary
        intervention. Inclusion criteria were stenoses of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-99%</NUMEX> in
        saphenous vein grafts <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mm</ENAMEX> in diameter, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5</NUMEX> mm
        from the ostium and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mm from the distal anastamosis, and
        at least <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TIMI 1</NUMEX> flow at baseline. Exclusion criteria
        included acute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, ejection fraction <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, creatinine
        ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dL (unless on hemodialysis), and planned use of
        an atherectomy device. The primary endpoint was the
        occurrence of major adverse clinical events at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX>,
        including death, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, emergency bypass surgery, and repeat
        target vessel revascularization.
        Pre-specified secondary endpoints were the frequency
        with which <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TIMI 3</NUMEX> flow was achieved, and clinically
        apparent no-flow occurred. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GuardWire</ENAMEX> was superior to
        'standard care' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2and 3</ENAMEX>). There was a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> relative
        reduction in cumulative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> major adverse cardiac events
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.8% to 9.0%</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> relative reduction
        in mortality (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8% to 0.9%</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX>), and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> relative
        reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.3% to 8.8%</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>). The trial was stopped
        early by the data safety monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX> promptly secured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval.
        Interestingly, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were used
        in ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, predominantly before
        intervention, major adverse clinical events were more
        common amongst those receiving the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. Since this was a
        non randomized, retrospective analysis, no conclusions
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a potentially beneficial (or deleterious) affect can
        be made. However, it is apparent that the reduction in
        major adverse clinical events in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GuardWire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> was
        independent of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>.
        Similarly, the feasibility and safety of carotid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angioplasty</ENAMEX> and stenting using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">PercuSurge</ENAMEX> GuardWire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> has been determined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Technical success was
        reported in a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, mean

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stenoses</ENAMEX>. Mean cerebral flow occlusion time was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">346</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> during predilation and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">303</NUMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">143 seconds</TIMEX> during

          AngioGuardâ„¢
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> 'class' of distal protection devices under
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and currently undergoing clinical
          investigation are the filter devices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AngioGuard</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cordis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) is an example of such a
          device that has recently received approval for marketing
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AngioGuard</ENAMEX>'s technology incorporates an
          angioplasty guidewire with a filter that expands to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm
          and is placed distal to the target lesion to capture and
          retrieve embolic debris (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). At the end of the
          procedure, the filter is collapsed, trapping the
          particulate matter and facilitating removal from the
          artery.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AngioGuard</ENAMEX> filter has multiple, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> micron,
          laser-drilled holes that allow perfusion during device
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deployment</ENAMEX>. It has been proposed that this is a major
          advantage of filter devices. In contrast, the balloon
          occlusion devices result in complete cessation of
          antegrade flow for as long as it takes to treat the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessel</ENAMEX> and aspirate the debris (typically <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-3 minutes</TIMEX> in
          the hands of experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 15</ENAMEX>]. This is a
          critical clinical consideration in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with reduced
          left ventricular function or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in whom the
          treated artery supplies a large amount of myocardium.
          Conversely, it has been proposed that incomplete vessel
          occlusion with the filter devices allows passage of
          debris through the holes of the filter devices. Indeed,
          analysis of debris retrieved by the balloon occlusion
          thrombectomy device in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAFE</ENAMEX> trial device found that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the particulate matter was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 100</NUMEX> microns
          in diameter. The clinical significance of such small
          embolic particles is unclear, and difficult to resolve
          since the completeness of debris entrapment by any distal
          protection device is impossible to determine in clinical
          practice.
          The initial experience with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AngioGuard</ENAMEX> filter
          device is promising. A phase I trial in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">33 consecutive</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> (in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) of the internal carotid artery
          documented successful deployment of the filter in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. Debris that might have been expected to
          result in distal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel occlusion</ENAMEX> was collected in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of
          cases. This technology is currently under investigation
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> for both carotid and coronary percutaneous
          interventions in appropriately sized trials.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study of Angioplasty</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection</ENAMEX> in Patients
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Risk for Endarterectomy</ENAMEX> (SAPPHIRE) is examining
          the benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AngioGuard</ENAMEX> device among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">720</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          undergoing carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery stenting</ENAMEX> in a randomized trial
          versus 'standard care' (no distal protection device) [

          this device in a study population analogous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAFER</ENAMEX>
          trial. The appropriateness of continuing such trials with
          a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> without distal protection has been a source
          of controversy. The use of the distal protection device
          reduces adverse events by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PercuSurge</ENAMEX> device) and
          is approved for use and currently available. As a result,
          the control <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> of these trials are now being
          reconsidered.

          is another filter device currently under clinical
          investigation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AngioGuard</ENAMEX>, it is
          a low-profile (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><3.5 French</NUMEX>) filter mounted on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.014</NUMEX>
          inch angioplasty wire with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pore</NUMEX> holes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> microns that
          permit antegrade blood flow while providing distal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX>. The filter design is characterized by an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">off-center</ENAMEX> position and 'fish-mouth' opening, and can be
          retracted into any standard angioplasty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX>. A
          radiopaque nitinol framework provides filter support and
          facilitates fluoroscopic visualization. Initial corporate
          reports of feasibility, safety, and clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX> are
          promising. A complication rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> was reported during

          a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.014 inch guidewire</NUMEX>, and its use requires both a
          delivery catheter and a retrieval catheter. The filter
          contains a pre-shaped nitinol expansion system that
          facilitates fluoroscopic visualization, accurate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deployment</ENAMEX>, and wall apposition. The filter guidewire is
          placed within the delivery catheter and is passed through
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> stenosis, the delivery catheter is withdrawn,
          the filter is deployed, and after completion of the
          vascular intervention (angioplasty, stenting, etc.) the
          retrieval catheter is used to envelop the filter. Then,
          the entire device and its embolic contents are
          withdrawn.

        catheter with an occlusion balloon attached at its distal
        end (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The PAES establishes protection by reversing
        blood flow in the target vessel [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. In the carotid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arteries</ENAMEX>, the system works by occluding the common carotid,
        which creates a negative pressure gradient distal to the
        balloon occlusion and establishes retrograde flow in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>. The external carotid is also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occluded</ENAMEX> to avoid flow traveling from the external one back
        up the internal one. This system establishes protection
        without the risk of disruption of the target lesion,
        thereby reducing the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">embolic stroke</ENAMEX> during device
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deployment</ENAMEX> prior to percutaneous intervention.

        Conclusion
        There remains great controversy about the clinical
        significance of the procedural infarctions that occur in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of percutaneous interventions in the
        native coronary arteries, and particularly the small
        subclinical infarctions that occur during otherwise
        successful procedures. There is nothing controversial or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subtle</ENAMEX>, however, about a great many of the embolic
        infarctions that occur during vein graft or carotid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. Neither the approved device nor the devices
        under investigation are, at present, perfect. Doubtless all
        will undergo improvements in the future, and offer hope for
        further increasing the safety of high-risk percutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>.
