        The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell
        motility, movement and morphology. The ability of soluble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monomeric G-actin</ENAMEX> to polymerize into filamentous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin in
        a reversible manner is central to the cellular function of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Rearrangement of actin is promoted rapidly
        by extracellular stimuli, and is facilitated by sets of
        actin-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, one of which is profilin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        It is now appreciated that a large number of cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX> co-opt actin for their gene expression and
        replication in the host cell [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Due to its primary
        role in pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory disease</ENAMEX>, and the enormous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and economic toll it exacts throughout the world, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory syncytial</ENAMEX> virus (RSV) and its interaction with
        the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> have received serious attention. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the 
        Pneumovirus genus in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paramyxoviridae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and contains
        a nonsegmented negative-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> genome of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 15</NUMEX> kb
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The minimal viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-dependent RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX>) consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> virally encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protein L</ENAMEX> and the phosphoprotein P [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M2-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22K</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contributes RNA</ENAMEX> antitermination
        function and optimal processivity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In addition to
        these viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RdRP</ENAMEX> also requires cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actin</ENAMEX>. Biochemical reconstitution studies using purified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> actin 
        in vitro and studies in RSV-infected
        cells ( 
        ex vivo ) demonstrated that actin
        functions as a viral transcription factor in both monomeric
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) and filamentous (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) forms, whereas the filamentous form
        appeared to be particularly important for viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Subsequent studies showed that at
        saturating actin concentration, profilin stimulated viral
        transcription even further, whereas profilin by itself had
        no transcriptional activity in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">actin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        . These results suggested that the interaction of profilin
        with actin may be important for optimal activity of the RSV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX>. It remained unknown whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">profilin</ENAMEX> plays a
        similar role 
        in vivo .
        Fusion of the infected cells is a hallmark of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramyxoviruses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ; the fused mass of cells is called
        "syncytium", from which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> derives its middle name.
        Although multiple viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may be required for
        optimal syncytium induction, the fusion protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> is the
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of the process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Syncytium most
        likely provides an efficient mechanism of cell-to-cell
        spread of the virus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 14</NUMEX> ] ; however, its exact role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">productive RSV</ENAMEX> infection or in the pathology of the disease
        has remained unclear. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection of HEp-2
        cells also led to the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">actin stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and
        activation of the small cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase RhoA</ENAMEX>, a modulator
        of actin filamentation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Inhibition of RhoA
        or its interaction with F resulted in the inhibition of
        syncytium as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> formation and the second
        cycle of infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Recombinant F</ENAMEX> also activated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> in the absence of any other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Based on these results, it was inferred that stress fiber
        formation might be important in some aspects of RSV
        infection, such as virus spread, elaboration of cytokines
        from infected cells, and contraction of airway muscles that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">promotes asthma</ENAMEX>.
        The epithelial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells of alveolar carcinoma origin
        exhibit many properties characteristic of the type II
        cells, such as the ability to produce surfactants. In cell
        culture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A549</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">monolayer</ENAMEX> also faithfully exhibits various
        aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection and RSV-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> interaction,
        including robust virus growth, formation of syncytia,
        activation of NF-kappa B (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF-κB</ENAMEX>), and elaboration of a
        battery of cytokines in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . In this paper we have, therefore, continued
        the use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells to elucidate the mechanism of
        RSV-actin interactions, and in particular, test the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> in the pathways that are likely to involve such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Viral partners</ENAMEX> of cellular profilin
          The minimal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of a nonsegmented
          negative-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viral RdRP</ENAMEX> are the viral large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protein L</ENAMEX> and the phosphoprotein P [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . While the L
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is believed to possess the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
          function, the P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> serves as its transcription
          factor. Together these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> transcribe the genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> wrapped with nucleocapsid protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> It is only the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and not the naked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, that serves as the
          functional template for the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RdRP</ENAMEX>. Because profilin,
          like P, also acts to stimulate viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          , we first tested if these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> interact directly
          in a purified system. Recombinant His-tagged P protein
          was immobilized on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni-NTA</ENAMEX> column and purified
          recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">profilin</ENAMEX> was passed through it. Results
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) showed that profilin indeed bound to P, and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were identified by staining as well as
          immunoblot analysis. No profilin bound to a control
          column lacking P. When an extract of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A549 cells</ENAMEX> was
          passed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> column, a few additional bands of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-34</NUMEX> kDa size range besides the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> kDa profilin were
          found to associate to the column. The identity of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bands</ENAMEX> was not determined, but we have previously shown
          that the catalytic subunit of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP2A</ENAMEX>, which has a
          similar size, binds to P [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The specific affinity
          of all of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for the P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the column
          was ascertained by the demonstration that pre-incubation
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> extract with excess purified P abolished
          their binding to the column. The reciprocal affinity
          experiment was not performed because we did not have a
          suitable matrix to immobilize profilin.
          We then tested whether profilin interacts with viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the RSV-infected cell. An extract of the
          RSV-infected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells was first subjected to
          immunoprecipitation by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti</ENAMEX>-P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precipitated proteins</ENAMEX> probed in immunoblot with profilin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) showed that profilin was
          indeed present in association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (lane
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A reciprocal immunoprecipitation of the infected cell
          extract was carried out using anti-profilin; the
          precipitate was found to contain P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) as
          well as profilin (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Interestingly, when this
          precipitate was probed with a mixture of antibodies
          against all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RSV proteins</ENAMEX>, in addition to P, the
          nucleocapsid protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> was detected (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). To further
          test the specificity of the interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N and P</ENAMEX> with
          profilin, another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, specific for the viral fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, was used to probe the profilin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitate</ENAMEX>; however, no F was detected (lane
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
          As components of the functional viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RdRP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and P
          bind each other [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . It was, therefore, important to
          ask whether they need each other (or other viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>) in order to interact with profilin, or whether
          they are individually capable of binding profilin. To
          answer this question, we expressed recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and P
          proteins individually by transient transfection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uninfected A549</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , and studied their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with profilin by co-immunoprecipitation.
          Results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) clearly demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N and P</ENAMEX> can
          each bind profilin, independent of each other and in the
          absence of any other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          To investigate the role of profilin in host-virus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> in intact cells, we sought to develop a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profilin</ENAMEX> knock-down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> by using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference
          targeted against profilin mRNA as described under
          Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> is now an
          established tool in knocking down specific intracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> in mammalian cell culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and our
          laboratory has pioneered its use in virus-infected cells
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Results presented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A) show
          that cells were substantially depleted of profilin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          nM siRNA. In our routine experiments, therefore, we have
          used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">400</ENAMEX> nM siRNA to achieve an essentially profilin-null
          cell. These cells were infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>, and the
          infected cell lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation
          studies. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the anti-P immunoprecipitate
          obtained from these cells, while containing appreciable
          quantities of the P <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), did not contain any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          We note here that no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> or syncytium was
          observed in cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N and P</ENAMEX> (data not shown),
          which is consistent with the notion that these proteins
          are primarily involved in viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA synthesis</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Profilin</ENAMEX> plays a minor role in viral gene
          expression
          Because profilin stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> transcription 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and associated with
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcriptional proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N and P</ENAMEX>, the obvious next
          question was to ask how important profilin was for viral
          gene expression in the intact RSV-infected cell. Our
          ability to knock down profilin now provided us with an
          opportunity to answer this question. The
          profilin-depleted cells were, therefore, infected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were quantified
          by appropriate techniques. In the very first experiment
          of this series, we sought to optimize the amount of
          siRNA, and tested their effects on profilin and viral P
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in infected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, a
          progressive loss of profilin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A) was not
          accompanied by any pronounced effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B),
          suggesting that profilin may not have a major role in
          viral gene expression. We then extended these studies to
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different cell lines and other viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Use of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> mixture allowed us to detect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viral G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N, P</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (panels C, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). In A549
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C) there was a small reduction in
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15% to 10%</NUMEX> reduction at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200-400</ENAMEX> nM siRNA); in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> L2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D) a somewhat
          greater reduction (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30-40%</NUMEX>) was observed. To test if
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> had a role in viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA synthesis</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">representative N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> mRNAs as well as the
          negative-stranded viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic RNA</ENAMEX> were quantitated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">real-time RT-PCR</ENAMEX> as described under <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          Methods. Results presented graphically (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> E)
          show that even at the highest siRNA concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM</ENAMEX>), at which essentially all the profilin was knocked
          down (data not shown), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60-80%</NUMEX> of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> synthesis
          continued in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells, whereas in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L2</NUMEX> cells the effect
          was slightly more severe, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-50%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> synthesis
          remaining. We conclude that profilin has only a minor
          role, if any, in the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> macromolecules in
          the infected cell, although it is impossible to rule out
          that small amounts of profilin survived the knock-down
          and sufficed for viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">actin stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> is
          cell-specific and profilin-dependent
          As discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, RSV-infection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2 cells</ENAMEX> was
          shown to rapidly induce the formation of actin stress
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and this process required an interaction between
          viral fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RhoA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          ] . To initiate studies of its mechanism, we first tested
          the universality of this finding. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> kinds of
          established epithelial cells of lung origin - namely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX> (rat) - were infected
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> at various multiplicities of infection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>),
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were probed for at various times by
          staining as described under <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods</ENAMEX>.
          Representative pictures clearly show that RSV-infection
          evoked stress fiber response in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2 cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>;
          compare uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A with infected cells
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B), confirming previous findings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . A
          particularly robust induction of stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> was also
          observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> L2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B). In
          contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were completely absent in
          RSV-infected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), suggesting that the
          signaling pathway that leads to stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> formation is
          missing or nonfunctional in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells.
          In order to investigate whether the formation of actin
          stress fibers requires profilin, we knocked down profilin
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells where stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were seen, namely,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX>. Upon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">RSV</ENAMEX> infection, the profilin-depleted
          cells failed to produce stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX> in Figs.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5, 6</ENAMEX>), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> formation is a
          profilin-dependent process. However, the loss of profilin
          had no detectable effect on intracellular RSV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>, as determined by immunostaining of the cells
          with anti-RSV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. It also did not have any
          detrimental effect on growth or morphology of the host
          cells e.g., (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Panel D</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Figs. 5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 70</NUMEX>
          hrs of cell culture.
          As <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber induction</ENAMEX> is a relatively early event
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection, one might wonder whether it plays an
          important role in intracellular virus growth, especially
          in the late phases. However, the results of Western blot,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">real-time PCR</ENAMEX>, and immunostaining clearly revealed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> replicated equally well inside all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cells,
          despite the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HEp-2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2</TIMEX>)
          evoked stress fibers whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A549</NUMEX>) failed to
          do so. Moreover, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> cell lines elaborated very
          similar titers of infectious progeny virus in the range
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3 × 10 7pfu /ml</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Combining all these
          results with the previous ones [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , we
          conclude that profilin is important for stress fiber
          formation, which is triggered by an interaction between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">viral F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX>. However, neither

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> nor stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> may be essential for the
          intracellular replication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Profilin</ENAMEX> is essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation and
          virion maturation
          As stated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the syncytium has been considered
          important for virus spread and pathology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Because
          profilin was obviously important in bringing about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeletal</ENAMEX> changes, it was logical to ask whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> also contributes to the fusion of cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX>. To answer this question, we knocked down
          profilin by siRNA as before, infected the cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX>,
          and looked for syncytia at various time points.
          Representative results at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hr post-infection are
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, showing that while syncytia occurred
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> control cells untreated with the siRNA,
          there were no syncytia in the profilin-depleted cells.
          However, the infected cells still exhibited a general
          cytopathic effect because, as we had shown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> (e.g.,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), the intracellular growth of the virus occurred
          at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 85-90%</NUMEX> efficiency in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX>.
          The next obvious question was whether profilin is
          required for the final steps of the viral life cycle,
          namely virus maturation and egress. To answer this, we
          measured the titer of infectious virions liberated from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> kinds of profilin-depleted cells infected after
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 hr</TIMEX> of siRNA-treatment. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of results
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) show that such cells produced nearly a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX>-fold less infectious virion. Longer
          pre-treatment with siRNA prior to the addition of the
          virus did not lead to further reduction of progeny yield,
          suggesting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> hr of siRNA-treatment was sufficient
          to achieve maximal reduction. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Virus titers</ENAMEX> were not
          affected in control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with siRNA against
          luciferase mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          To examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> profile of the extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virions</ENAMEX> released from profilin-depleted and undepleted
          cells, the culture media of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells were collected
          and the virions were concentrated by sedimentation at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110,000</NUMEX> × g. As expected, a much larger volume of the
          profilin-depleted cell media was needed to produce a
          comparable amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus pellet</ENAMEX>. However, when equal
          amounts (by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein assay</ENAMEX>) of virus were analyzed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western blot</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of virions exhibited an
          identical profile of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown). In contrast, while the virions from untreated
          cells contained substantial amounts of profilin,
          confirming our previous finding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , those from
          profilin-depleted cells were found to be essentially
          devoid of profilin (data not shown). Thus, it appeared
          that the small number of profilin-free virus particles
          that were released from profilin-depleted cells retained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infectivity</ENAMEX>. Clearly, a more detailed and quantitative
          analysis will be needed to determine the relationship
          between the profilin content and infectivity of a virus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particle</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, we can conclude that profilin
          plays an essential role in the optimal yield of mature
          virions from all cells tested.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Results in this communication point to the existence of
        a number of potential cellular and viral interactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> in which profilin may play a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> role. In
        fact, profilin was found to be essential for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        effects tested: viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maturation</ENAMEX>, cell fusion, and stress
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> formation. Based on our findings and relevant
        published data, we present a working model in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. For
        the sake of simplicity, we have depicted profilin as
        functioning through actin in all these pathways. This is
        certainly true for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber induction</ENAMEX>, as the stress
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are physically made of filamentous actin. For
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation and viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maturation</ENAMEX>, however, we could
        not rule out the possibility that profilin might also have
        a direct role. Knock-down of actin completely destroyed the
        cell's architecture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , and therefore, was not a
        meaningful approach in these studies. Similarly, although
        the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is depicted as an important trigger for
        many pathways in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        and many cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> may act as important mediators
        at various steps. In the following sections we discuss
        these biochemical pathways in some detail.
        The membrane microdomains shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9have recently
        received much attention as gateways of trafficking and
        signaling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . Also called membrane rafts or lipid
        rafts, they are specific membrane sites, rich in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and sphingolipids. These microdomains recruit
        an impressively large number of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
        regulatory molecules such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rho</ENAMEX>, profilin, actin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">caveolin-1, CD44</ENAMEX>, and phosphotidylinositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>-biphosphate
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PIP2</NUMEX>), and have been shown to be important in a variety of
        cellular functions in health and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] .
        Recently, a number of pathogens have been shown to hijack
        these sites for their entry, exit, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>; such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> include many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">measles</ENAMEX> virus,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> virus, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . In a very
        recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , filamentous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> was confirmed to exit
        through membrane microdomains, and immunological analysis
        placed RSV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> F, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, and P at these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Combining
        these findings, we propose that the activated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RhoA</ENAMEX> utilizes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> to bring about a net polymerization of actin in
        the RSV-infected cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). The actin filaments may
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anchor</ENAMEX> to specific membrane microdomains, and together,
        both of them make important contributions to RSV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-RSV signaling.
        The cellular role or significance of stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> has remained uncertain. In fact, stress fibers
        could very well be artifacts of adherent growth on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> or
        plastic surfaces, as they are rarely found in cells in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. As we stated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the absence of stress fibers
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> cell suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> per se are not
        essential for RSV growth either, and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> steps
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F) → RhoA</ENAMEX> → profilin → actin signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> is perhaps missing or nonfunctional in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX>. We
        have not found any obvious difference in the expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RSV proteins</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, between the stress-fiber
        responsive and unresponsive cells (for example, compare the
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">0</ENAMEX>" siRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX> and D in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in this pathway are also evolutionarily conserved,
        and indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells express comparable amounts
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX>, profilin, and actin (data not shown). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionality of the RhoA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A549 cells</ENAMEX> is substantiated by
        a number of previous studies, such as the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> in
        bradykinin-mediated activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-kappa B</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , and
        the abrogation of H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -mediated activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNK</ENAMEX> by RhoA
        antisense oligonucleotide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Profilin purified from
        A549 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> is also indistinguishable from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2</ENAMEX> cell
        profilin, in terms its molecular weight, pI, affinity for
        poly-proline, and ability to stimulate actin-dependent
        transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> genome 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the inability
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells to elicit actin stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> is likely due
        to an as yet unidentified factor or pathway that may be
        altered or missing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A549</TIMEX> cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, a detailed
        analysis of the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> and HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells
        promises to shed light on this difference and lead to the
        identification of the missing function.
        Regarding the syncytium, it is well established that the
        F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> plays an active role in its formation. Based on
        the premise described above, it is conceivable that the
        membrane microdomains may serve as nucleation points for
        the initial mixing of the membrane lipids with help from F,
        and this process may then travel through the membrane,
        eventually producing a completely fused cell mass
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">syncytium</NUMEX>). In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we have shown an importance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> in this process. If this function of profilin is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mediated</ENAMEX> through actin, results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells suggest
        that the actin filaments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-actin</ENAMEX>) involved in syncytium
        must be smaller that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and not discernible by
        light microscopy. It is possible that short <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymers</ENAMEX>, anchored at the microdomains, trigger syncytium.
        This is so proposed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>.
        Although syncytium is a common and one of the most
        visible morphological outcomes of infection by many
        viruses, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramyxoviruses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , its relevance
        in virus replication has remained speculative. Extrinsic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> blockers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> inhibited the very first
        step in infection, i.e., attachment of the virus to the
        cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , suggesting an important role of F in this
        step. In another study, a different approach was taken to
        inhibit the intracellular function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX> The domain of RhoA
        that binds to F was mapped to RhoA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77-95</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture, a peptide of this sequence inhibited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syncytium</ENAMEX> and cell-to-cell spread of the virus, suggesting
        that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> might be related, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation
        required signaling through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The same peptide,
        however, also inhibited human parainfluenza virus type 3
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPIV-3</ENAMEX>), the reason for which was not obvious. Moreover,
        it remained unclear whether the signals that eventually led
        to syncytia had any effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intracellular</ENAMEX> virus
        replication or maturation. To answer these questions, we
        have taken yet another approach in this paper by targeting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX>. However, we observed profilin-dependence of viral
        maturation even in sub-confluent monolayers where the cells
        were well separated, as well as in single-burst experiments
        (data not shown). Thus, we suggest that profilin has a
        direct role in virus maturation independent of its role in
        cell fusion. We would like to believe that syncytium is an
        outcome of viral infection, and as such, is unimportant for
        viral maturation in single cells. We do not rule out,
        however, that cell fusion may accelerate virus spread
        through closely packed cells such as in an infected tissue.
        Again, it is quite possible that the microdomain-anchored
        short actin filaments, proposed above, may allow the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">docking</ENAMEX> and assembly of subviral particles inside the
        infected cell. Perhaps the observed interaction of profilin
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N and P</ENAMEX> facilitates the transfer of the viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribonucleoprotein</ENAMEX> to these filaments. In the final phase of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus replication</ENAMEX>, these same short <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actins may also
        assist in virus locomotion and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> through the cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. As mentioned, recent studies have indeed shown
        that budding of progeny RS virions occurs primarily through
        the membrane microdomains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        To sum up, profilin can act as a major liaison between
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and actin, and articulate multiple outcomes
        for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and the virus, involving signal
        transduction as well as cytoskeletal changes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
        Studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> indicated that profilin is
        generally nonessential for cellular viability, although
        profilin mutants have phenotypes. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, profilin null
        mutations result in cells that are viable at permissive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, but grow more slowly, are larger than wild
        type, and are often multinucleate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chickadee</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chic</ENAMEX> ) gene encodes 
        Drosophila profilin and 
        chic mutations produce sterile female
        flies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, profilin mutations
        resulted in defects in actin polymerization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39 40</NUMEX> ] .
        In addition to regulating actin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo evidence suggests a role for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> in signal transduction, mainly involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PIP2</ENAMEX>, a
        major second <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> that strongly binds to profilin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
        ] and localizes to the membrane microdomains described
        earlier. Thus, in addition to the actin pathway, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C → PIP2</ENAMEX> pathway may also be involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX>'s role in host-RSV interaction. In either case,
        the relative nonessentiality of profilin in cellular
        viability makes it an attractive drug target for the
        intervention of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogenesis</ENAMEX> over a short window of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. It should be noted that besides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">profilin</ENAMEX>, there are
        many other cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to modulate actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filamentation</ENAMEX> and cytoskeletal dynamics, and profilin
        itself binds to a large number <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, many with
        poly-proline sequences [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] . Clearly, identification
        of the various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the cytoskeletal signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> will constitute an important step in understanding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-RSV interaction, and may lead to additional targets
        for pathological intervention. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we provide
        proof-of-concept that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> can be a major tool
        in dissecting the pathways of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-virus interaction.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference using sequence-specific siRNA can be
        successfully used to knock down profilin, a major
        actin-modulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Detailed
        studies of infection of such cells by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> reveals that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> is needed for cell fusion, which is a universal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">response RSV</ENAMEX> infection in all cell lines tested. Profilin
        is also essential for the final stages of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maturation</ENAMEX>,
        as profilin-depleted cells fail to release infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">progeny</ENAMEX> virus. Profilin binds to viral transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N and P</ENAMEX>, but makes only a small contribution in
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX>; perhaps these interactions allow
        docking of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> to the actin filaments. In
        contrast, RSV-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actin</ENAMEX> stress fibers form only in some
        cells but not in others, suggesting a nonessential role of
        stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and an involvement of cell-specific signaling
        molecules in this pathway. Thus, profilin is involved in
        virus-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syncytium</ENAMEX> formation and stress fiber
        induction, and in viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>. It remains to be
        seen whether these are due to profilin's ability to
        reorganize the cytoskeleton, or due to a direct
        participation of profilin in these processes. The
        determination of the various interactive domains of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profilin</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in these pathways may allow one
        to design anti-RSV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that will disrupt specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-virus interactions without extensive cytotoxicity.

          antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV proteins G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> were purchased
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemicon International</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temecula</ENAMEX>, CA) and the

          cloned in this vector. In transient transfection
          experiments, optimal amounts of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were
          transfected into monolayers-grown cells using the Fugene
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 reagent</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Diagnostics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, IN). All RSV
          infections were carried out at an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> using RSV
          Long grown on HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells and purified as described

          corresponded to nucleotide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">348</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366</NUMEX> of human profilin I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accession No. NM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">005022</ENAMEX>). Transfection of monolayer
          cells with the siRNA and subsequent infection of the
          cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSV</ENAMEX> were carried out essentially as described
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, after designing the siRNA and
          successfully using it to knock down profilin in rat
          cells, we realized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> profilin sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Accession No. X96967</ENAMEX>) differs from the human sequence by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nucleotide; the underlined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> of human is A in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>.
          The serendipitous success of the human siRNA against rat
          profilin suggested that small mismatch(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">es</ENAMEX>) may be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference, the details of which will
          be published elsewhere. Substantial tolerance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nucleotide mismatch in siRNA-mediated silencing of
          human coagulation trigger tissue factor mRNA has been
          reported recently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . When siRNA transfected cells
