        The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily of enzymes
        consists of a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>)-dependent enzymes which can
        oxidize a structurally diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of endogenous and
        exogenous aldehyde substrates. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seventeen</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH genes</ENAMEX> have been identified in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> and have been classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> based on amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence identities
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . High levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX> activity can protect human
        and murine cells from the toxicity of the alkylating agent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclophosphamide</ENAMEX> and its oxazaphosphorine analogs. Indeed
        it was hypothesized that the high expression of ALDH1A1
        (formerly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class 1</ENAMEX> ALDH) was responsible for the
        successful use of cyclophosphamide in tumor cell purging
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow transplantation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The
        detection of elevated ALDH1A1 activity in the most
        primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ]
        has provided evidence in support of this hypothesis.
        However, no physiologic role for this enzyme in the
        hematopoietic stem cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has been identified.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Vitamin A</ENAMEX> (retinol) is the prototype of a class of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natural</ENAMEX> and synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical compounds</ENAMEX> named the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinoids</ENAMEX>. Retinoids are found in a variety of chemical
        oxidation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, aldehyde, ester, and
        carboxylic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid functionalities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid form</ENAMEX>, retinoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, is a pleiotropic hormone which regulates gene
        expression in embryonic development, epithelial cell
        differentiation, hematopoeisis, and tumor cell
        formation.
        Several enzymes, including isoforms of alcohol
        dehydrogenase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALDH</ENAMEX>, and cytochrome <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P450</TIMEX> (CYP), recently
        have been shown to be involved in the formation of retinoic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> from retinol and retinal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The purification,
        cloning, and characterization of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALDH</ENAMEX> enzymes which
        efficiently catalyze the oxidation of retinal (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>)
        has suggested that regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> formation
        could be a key physiologic role for these enzymes. The
        report of the crystal structure of the homotetrameric
        ALDH1A1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> liver revealed a substrate tunnel
        capable of binding retinal which was absent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH2</TIMEX> and
        ALDH3A1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Likewise, the crystal structure
        reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> ALDH1A2 revealed a substrate channel
        which could provide specificity for retinal and exclude
        short-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> aliphatic aldehydes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        The specific role of each enzyme in the regulation of
        retinoid signalling may depend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, cell type,
        and developmental status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. 
        In vitro, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purified</ENAMEX> mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ,
        human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ALDH1A1 can
        efficiently oxidize 
        all-trans retinal to 
        all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX>. 
        In vivo , the introduction of ALDH1A1
        mRNA into 
        Xenopus embryos induces early
        synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX>, while ALDH1A1 expression is
        detected during the tail bud stages of 
        Xenopus embryogenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        ALDH1A2 in the mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] has shown even
        greater specificity and catalytic efficiency for retinal as
        a substrate. Immuno-histochemical analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> embryos
        shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> expression occurs primarily in cranial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, while ALDH1A2 expression occurs primarily in trunk
        tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In addition, the targeted knockout of the 
        ALDH1A2 gene in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> results in a
        significant decrease in retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid biosynthesis</ENAMEX> and
        early embryo death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> which can target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual ALDH</ENAMEX> enzymes provides one approach for
        addressing the role of a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALDH</ENAMEX> enzyme in the
        oxidation of retinal to retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in a given cell type.
        We have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dipropylamino</ENAMEX>)benzaldehyde
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-diethylamino</ENAMEX>) benzaldehyde
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX>) as potent, selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX>, but not
        ALDH2 or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH3</TIMEX>, with the dipropyl analog exhibiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold
        greater efficacy for inhibition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . The effect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A2</TIMEX> has not been reported.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> was first used to sensitize the mouse leukemic cell
        line L1210<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/CPA</ENAMEX>, which is resistant to
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-HC</ENAMEX>) by virtue of its
        overexpression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX>. Treatment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1210</TIMEX>/CPA cells 
        in vitro with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX> DEAB abolished
        the tumor cells' resistance to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> also
        exhibited 
        in vivo efficacy as a ALDH1A1
        inhibitor, as demonstrated by the toxicity to the
        intestinal crypt cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> receiving co-injections of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> and cyclophosphamide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> has
        been used to demonstrate that overexpression of human
        ALDH1A1 in transfected cell lines is sufficient to cause
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> to the oxazaphosphorines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-HC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> has also been an effective reagent in
        fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) techniques to
        isolate human hematopoietic stem cells based on the
        expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX> activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . In contrast to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX>, daidzin - a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> isolated from 
        Pueraria lobata (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kudzu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>) -
        shows specificity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">inhibiting ALDH2</TIMEX> at concentrations
        similar to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DPAB</ENAMEX> used to inhibit ALDH1A1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        An inhibitor specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A2</TIMEX> has not yet been
        reported.
        In normal hematopoiesis, terminally differentiated cells
        are generated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> from a limited number of pluripotent
        stem cells. The stem cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> must be exquisitely
        regulated to ensure sufficient self-renewal as well as
        commitment to progenitor cells which can give rise to
        mature erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, granulocytes,
        and macrophages. Retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> appears to elicit a complex
        response of cell proliferation and/or commitment to a more
        differentiated cell type, depending on the differentiation
        state of the cell receiving the signal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] .
        The HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> human promyelocytic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> cell line
        responds in culture to sub-micromolar concentrations of
        retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">all-trans</ENAMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13-cis</NUMEX> ) by undergoing terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> to a granulocytic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> with the ability to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phagocytose</ENAMEX> and reduce nitroblue tetrazolium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The
        response to retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells is dependent on
        the expression of the retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptor RAR Î±</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        The use of 
        all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> in
        differentiation therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute
        promyelocytic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> has resulted in prolonged, complete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remissions</ENAMEX> when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and
        may provide complete, long-term remissions as a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        However, the enzyme or enzymes responsible for the
        formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the HL60</TIMEX> cells have not been
        identified. In one report, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1 protein</ENAMEX> was not detected
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western blot</ENAMEX>, but enzyme activity was detected using
        flow cytometry and a fluorescent aldehyde substrate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1 protein</ENAMEX> was detected using an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> assay and activity was detected using aldophosphamide
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . In these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies, designed to
        look at the relationship of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX> activity to antitumor
        drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, the levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX> were low in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        compared to other cell types, corresponding to the
        sensitivity of HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells to oxazaphosphorines. ALDH
        activity has been reported in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells using
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-hydroxynonenal as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . However, since this
        molecule is such a poor substrate with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1</TIMEX> compared to
        ALDH3, the measured activity likely represents only ALDH3
        activity. ALDH3 does not oxidize 
        all trans retinal. Expression of
        ALDH1A2 activity in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells has not been reported.
        Therefore, we chose the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> cell line to assess the role
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> in the oxidation of retinal.
        The collection of results demonstrating that retinal is
        an excellent substrate for ALDH1A1 
        in vitro , that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> is
        responsible for the synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> in the
        cranial tissues of the mouse embryo, and that hematopoietic
        stem cells are characterized by high expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX>,
        have led to the hypothesis that the oxidation of retinal to
        retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is a key physiologic role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX> in
        hematopoietic stem cells. Our long-term goal is to use DPAB
        to investigate the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> in retinoic acid
        biosynthesis at different stages of hematopoiesis. In this
        paper we show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> is a potent inhibitor of retinal
        oxidation by murine and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> only
        weakly inhibits the retinal-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> of
        HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> is not the operative
        retinal oxidizing enzyme in these cells.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> is a potent inhibitor of retinal oxidation with IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.11 and 0.13 Î</NUMEX>¼M for
        purified <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        These IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold lower than the
        retinal concentrations used in the assay. The IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values for mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> are between
        the values observed with propanal (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.040 Î¼M</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylacetaldehyde</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.36 Î¼M</NUMEX>) as substrates, with the human
        ALDH1A1 showing the same inhibition with retinal or
        propanal as substrate. The IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values reported were initially
        obtained from spectrophotometric assays, and repeated with
        an HPLC assay. We were concerned with using a
        spectrophotometric assay for these inhibition studies due
        to the presence of several absorbing species at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> nm,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX>, retinal, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX>. Thus, we
        modified an HPLC assay in order to directly measure the
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid product</ENAMEX> formed. Previous reports of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> assays for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALDH</ENAMEX> reactions with tissue extracts used a
        single time point at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX> to measure accumulation of
        product, after documenting that retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> formation was
        still linear in time course experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In our
        hands, the reaction with purified enzyme was only linear
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> formation up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-15 minutes</TIMEX>.
        Following continuous exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> for
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 hours</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 40%</NUMEX> of cells have differentiated to
        granulocytes, as seen by the positive NBT staining.
        Exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M 
        all-trans retinal for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 hours</TIMEX>
        induced differentiation equivalent to exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
        Î¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX>. With co-exposures to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M retinal and up
        to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX> DEAB or DPAB, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> was inhibited
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 30%</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">144 hours</TIMEX> of exposure, compared with
        cells exposed to retinal alone (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> did not
        alter the induction of differentiation by retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>,
        nor did it affect cell viability up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">144 hours</TIMEX>. Since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX>'s inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX> in cells exposed
        to retinal was so low, we needed to demonstrate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> oxidation or any serum enzymatic oxidation of
        retinal to retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was not occuring under our culture
        conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> dishes containing media and retinal
        were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">144 hours</TIMEX>, with aliquots removed every
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> and analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 6</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> of
        the retinal was oxidized to retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, suggesting that
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzymatic</ENAMEX> formation or serum-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mediated</ENAMEX> formation of
        retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was not responsible for the observed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> in cells exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> or DPAB.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> is a more potent inhibitor of human
        ALDH1A1 than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX>, we were concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> was not
        remaining in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX> in the culture media.
        However, the observation that the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX>, a much
        more soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>, resulted in the same percent
        inhibition, suggested that solubility was not a factor.
        Thus, artifacts due to solubility of inhibitor and
        extracellular oxidation of retinal do not appear to
        contribute to the observed response of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> on retinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidation</ENAMEX>.
        In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX>-dependent oxidation of propanal or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retinal</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.05</NUMEX> nmoles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX> formed<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/min-10</ENAMEX> 7cells
        in spectrophotometric assays using HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell extracts</ENAMEX>,
        even in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAB</ENAMEX> or DPAB. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX>-dependent
        oxidation of these aldehydes was not reproducibly detected
        above background in spectrofluorometric assays. Therefore,
        though low levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX> activity have been reported in
        HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells in previous studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 31</ENAMEX> ] , it appears that
        the differentiation observed in cells exposed to retinal
        alone or retinal plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> was not mediated by ALDH1A1
        oxidation of retinal to retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is
        that a cytochrome <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P450</TIMEX> (CYP) enzyme is catalyzing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raner et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chen et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] have
        described the formation of all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retinal</ENAMEX> and retinol by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CYP1</TIMEX> and CYP3A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. In addition, expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CYP1A1 and CYP3A4</TIMEX> mRNA
        has been reported in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The contribution
        of ALDH1A2 also can't be ruled out. However, its activity
        should be detected by the spectrophotometric or
        fluorometric assays.
        Although ALDH1A2 appears only to catalyze the oxidation
        of 
        all-trans retinal to 
        all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX>, both ALDH1A1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CYP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CYP3A</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> are capable of oxidizing 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-cis retinal to 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-cis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid receptors</ENAMEX> includes those that bind only 
        all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> (RAR Î±,Î²,Î³
        and those that bind either 
        all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> or 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-cis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> (RXR Î±,Î²,Î³ Since
        the transcriptional regulation of the retinoic acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ligand/</ENAMEX>receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> appears to involve the binding of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor heterodimers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR/RXR</ENAMEX>), the specific cellular
        response may depend on the ratio of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">all-trans</ENAMEX> to 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-cis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> formed, as well
        as the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subtypes</ENAMEX>.
        Our results suggest an intriguing possibility that
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> formation in the HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells,
        and the subsequent terminal differentiation to
        granulocytes, could be mediated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> enzymatic acitivy,
        e.g. a CYP-mediated oxidation of retinal, whereas
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> formation in the hematopoietic
        stem cells, and the subsequent maintenance of the
        self-renewal capacity of the hematopoietic stem cells, is
        mediated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALDH1A1</TIMEX> oxidation of retinal (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> can be tested by using global or specific CYP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> in the presence of retinal in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells and by
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> in the presence of retinal in an hematopoietic
        stem cell assay system. We are attempting to assess the
        ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> to block retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> formation in
        cultured, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> hematopoietic stem cells.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPAB</ENAMEX> can serve as a potent inhibitor
        of purified human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> and should be a useful
        molecule to assess the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> in retinal oxidation
        in a cell system. In addition, our results indicate that in
        HL60 cells, the prototype cell line for studying retinoic
        acid induced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALDH1A1</ENAMEX> is not the
        operative oxidizing enzyme for retinal.
