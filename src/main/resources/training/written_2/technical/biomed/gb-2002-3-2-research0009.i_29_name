        The pattern of genes expressed in a cell can provide
        important information about the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
        technology can measure the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes
        in a biological sample. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have been
        increasingly used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> and have the
        potential to help advance our biological knowledge at a
        genomic scale [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. In analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data, a major role has been played by
        various cluster-analysis techniques, most notably by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hierarchical clustering</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-means clustering [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and
        self-organizing maps [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. These clustering techniques
        contribute significantly to our understanding of the
        underlying biological phenomena. A recent review of various
        methods is provided by Tibshirani 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. However, many methods,
        including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mentioned above, have some
        restrictions, one of which is their inability to determine
        the number of clusters. The difficulty may be related to
        the fact that in many methods there is no clear definition
        of what a cluster is in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. Furthermore, their
        clustering results may not be stable [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]. An important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clustering</ENAMEX> technique that improves on and/or provides
        alternative solutions to these issues is model-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> (see, for example, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]). It has a clear
        definition that a cluster is a subpopulation with a certain
        distribution, and several statistical methods can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to estimate the number of clusters. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        have considered its application to cluster gene-expression
        patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>].
        Here we consider the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based clustering in
        the context of detecting differentially expressed genes,
        which is to identify all the genes with altered expression
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experimental conditions (for example, normal
        cells versus cancer cells). We note that the goal here is
        different from that of clustering gene-expression patterns,
        as done by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in using model-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX>. In modeling differential expression levels of
        genes, it is natural to assume that genes are from two
        subpopulations, one with constant and another with changed
        expression levels. Hence, a two-component mixture is a
        reasonable model. This is the approach proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], where it is assumed
        that each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components has a normal (in the
        statistical sense) distribution. However, in general, each
        component does not necessarily have a normal distribution.
        It is well known that many distributions can be well
        approximated by a finite mixture of normal distributions.
        Hence, the normal mixture model-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clustering</ENAMEX> can be
        regarded as a more general and flexible approach along
        these lines and we pursue this approach here. In
        particular, we summarize a possible change of expression of
        a gene using a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistic, which automatically
        accounts for differential variations of expression levels
        across genes. Then we apply model-based clustering to these
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics to exploit which genes
        have differential expression levels. The methodology is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> with an application to a dataset containing the
        expression levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,176</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of normal rats and those
        with pneumococcal middle-ear infection.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> and preprocessing
          Pneumococcal otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> is one of the most common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> experiences <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> episode of acute otitis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 5 years</TIMEX>. To understand the
          pathogenesis of otitis media, it is important to identify
          genes involved in response to pneumococcal middle-ear
          infection and to study their roles in otitis media. A
          study was recently carried out at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, applying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radioactively</ENAMEX> labeled cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] to the mRNA analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,176</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
          middle-ear mucosa of rats with and without subacute
          pneumococcal middle-ear infection. It consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          experiments: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cDNA microarrays were run with controls
          while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> were run with pneumococcal middle-ear
          infection. We first take a natural logarithm
          transformation for all the observed gene-expression
          levels so that they are more likely to have a normal
          distribution, which will reduce the number of clusters
          found in a model-based clustering. The histograms of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels before and after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">log-</ENAMEX>transformation for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiment are shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. It can be seen that the log-transformation
          reduces the skewness of the distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels.
          After taking log-transformation, for each experiment
          we then standardize the transformed gene-expression
          levels by subtracting their median value. The above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardization</ENAMEX> is based on the assumption that most
          genes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least a half</NUMEX>, will not be expressed. The median
          is used because it is more robust against outliers than
          is the more commonly used mean. We use 
          x 
          
            ij 
           to denote the resulting expression level of gene 
          i from experiment 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> . Note that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          experiments (that is, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>) were conducted using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> rats whereas the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> (that is, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j = 3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>) using infected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Some scatterplots showing comparisons between
          experiments are presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. It can be seen
          that, in general, there is a good agreement as well as
          some variation between the experiments under the same
          condition, that is, either within the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or
          within the infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. It appears that expression of
          some genes are altered with pneumococcal infection.
          On the basis of the above observation, we calculate
          the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistic for each gene as its
          measure of possible differential expression:
          
          where:
          
          for 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, ...<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1176</NUMEX>. The numerator of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           is the difference of average gene-expression levels
          under the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions (infected versus control),
          whereas the denominator is the sample standard error of
          the numerator and serves to standardize the observed
          difference by penalizing those with large (and thus less
          reliable) variations. Previous studies have found
          evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may have differential variability of
          expression levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. Note that although the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistic is constructed, we
          shall not conduct 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests because there is no
          evidence to support the questionable normality assumption
          required by the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test. We also do not carry out
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permutation</ENAMEX> or other nonparametric tests [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] because of
          the small sample size (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This is also
          related with the fact that there exists the problem of
          multiple comparisons if we test gene by gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Our
          goal here is to apply model-based cluster analysis to the
          preprocessed relative gene-expression levels 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           , 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, ..., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1176</TIMEX>, and see which
          genes will have relative levels far away from the
          majority.
        
        
          Model-based clustering
          Finite mixtures of distributions provide a flexible as
          well as rigorous approach to modeling various random
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX> (for example, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]). For continuous data, such
          as gene-expression data, the use of normal components in
          the mixture distribution is natural. With a normal
          mixture model-based approach to clustering, it is assumed
          that the data to be clustered are from several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subpopulations</ENAMEX> (or clusters or components) with
          distinguished normal distributions. That is, each data
          point 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> is taken to be a realization from
          a normal mixture distribution with the probability
          density function:
          
          where φ ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">y ;μ</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           , 
          V 
          
            i 
           ) denotes the normal density function with mean μ 
          
            i 
           and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>)variance matrix 
          V 
          
            i 
           , and π 
          
            i 
           's are mixing proportions. We use Φ 
          
            g 
           to represent all unknown parameters (π 
          
            i 
           , μ 
          
            i 
           , V 
          
            i 
           ): 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, ... 
          g in a 
          g -component (or 
          g -cluster) mixture model.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based clustering, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the above mixture
          model is fitted to the data and obtain the maximum
          likelihood estimate 
          
            g 
           . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the posterior probabilities of each data
          point belonging to each of the 
          g normal components can be
          calculated. Finally, each data point is assigned to the
          component with the largest posterior probability. We
          review the major steps in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX>.
          The mixture <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is typically fitted by maximum
          likelihood using the expectation-maximization (EM)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Given 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> observations 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , ..., 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
           , we want to maximize the log-likelihood
          
          to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate 
          
            g 
           . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> algorithm computes 
          
            g 
           by iterating the following steps.
          Suppose that at the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k th</ENAMEX> iteration, the parameter
          estimates are π 
          
            i 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> )'s, μ 
          
            i 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> )'s and 
          V 
          
            i 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> )'s. Then in the ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)th iteration, the estimates
          are updated by
          
          for 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, ..., 
          g where
          
          is the posterior probability that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           belongs to the 
          i th component of the mixture,
          using the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parameter</ENAMEX> estimate for Φ 
          
            g 
           , for 
          i = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, ..., 
          g and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j = 1</ENAMEX>, ..., 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> .
          At convergence, we obtain 
          
            g 
           = as the maximum likelihood estimate. As local
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">maxima</ENAMEX> can be found by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> algorithm, it is desirable
          to run the algorithm multiple times with various starting
          values and choose the estimate as the one resulting in
          the largest log-likelihood.
          One interesting but difficult problem in cluster
          analysis is to determine the number of components 
          g . In contrast to many other
          approaches that fail to accomplish this goal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> provides several useful and objective
          selection criteria, which have been used in other model
          selection problems. The best known are the Akaike
          Information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Criterion</ENAMEX> (AIC) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and the Bayesian
          Information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Criterion</ENAMEX> (BIC) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]:
          
          where 
          v 
          
            g 
           is the number of independent parameters in Φ 
          
            g 
           . In using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIC</ENAMEX> or BIC, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> fits series of
          models with various values of 
          g , then one picks up the 
          g with the smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIC</ENAMEX> or BIC.
          In many studies related to model selection, it is
          found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIC</ENAMEX> may select too large a model whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX>
          may select too small a model. This phenomenon appears to
          hold in selecting 
          g in the mixture analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
          Some other criteria have been studied but there does not
          seem to be a clear winner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banfield</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raftery</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>] proposed using approximate weight of evidence as an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">approximate Bayesian</ENAMEX> model selection criterion. Some
          empirical studies seem to favor the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. We
          feel that a combined use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX> is helpful, at
          least in providing a range of reasonable values of 
          g .
          A different approach to selecting 
          g is through hypothesis testing.
          This could be done through the use of the log-likelihood
          ratio test (LRT) to test for the null hypothesis 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 :</TIMEX> 
          g = 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> against the alternative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 :</TIMEX> 
          g = 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 +1</NUMEX> for any given positive integer 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRT</ENAMEX> statistic is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ( 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 +1</NUMEX>) - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> log 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ( 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ), which, however, does not have the
          usual asymptotically chi-squared distribution as a result
          of violation of required regularity conditions (for
          example, the maximum likelihood estimate may lie in the
          boundary of its parameter space). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLachlan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]
          proposed using the bootstrap to approximate the
          distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRT</ENAMEX> statistic under the null
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. On the basis of the resulting

          Implementation
          McLachlan 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] have implemented
          model-based clustering in a stand-alone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortran</ENAMEX> program
          called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMMIX</ENAMEX>, which is freely available from the web [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>]. It supports all the functions we described above,
          including multiple start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> algorithm using random
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partition</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> -mean clustering, calculation of
          the model selection criteria <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIC</ENAMEX>, and the use of
          the bootstrap to test a given number of components 
          g 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . We will use EMMIX to analyze the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>.
          The MCLUST software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], implementing model-based
          clustering, is also freely available [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. It is
          designed to interface with the commercial statistical
          package S<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-Plus</NUMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> familiar with S<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-Plus</NUMEX>, it is
          convenient to take advantage of the power and flexibility
          of S<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-Plus</NUMEX>. However, at the same time, it can have some
          serious restrictions on the size of the data being
          analyzed because of the overhead on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CPU</ENAMEX> speed and memory
          induced by S<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-Plus</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Application
          We fitted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mixture models</ENAMEX> with 
          g ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 5</TIMEX>. Table
          1summarizes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the model</TIMEX> fitting results. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIC</ENAMEX> or BIC,
          we would select 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> respectively. Also, from the
          log-likelihood values, there is a dramatic change when 
          g is increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          However, from 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> log 
          L increases very slowly. Hence,
          both 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> appear reasonable. To
          determine which one is better, we applied the bootstrap
          method (also implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMMIX</ENAMEX>) to test 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 :</TIMEX> 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 :</TIMEX> 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> bootstrap
          resamples, we were unable to reject 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> as the resulting 
          p value is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>, larger than the
          usual <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05 nominal</NUMEX> level. In contrast, if we test 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 :</TIMEX> 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 :</TIMEX> 
          g = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, then we will reject 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> with a small 
          p value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>. Therefore, we choose
          to fit a three-component normal mixture model.
          The fitted mixture <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is
          
          f ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y ;</ENAMEX> ) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.042</NUMEX> x 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.74</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77.07</NUMEX>) + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.510</NUMEX> × 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.88</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.56</NUMEX>) + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.448</NUMEX> × 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.15</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 95%</NUMEX> of data points fall into the two
          clusters with means <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to 0</NUMEX>. That means there is
          either no or little change in gene-expression levels for
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> classified into
          the first cluster seem to have a change in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels. This can be verified from Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, which shows the profiles of gene-expression levels
          across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> experiments for each cluster.
          In addition to determining the number of clusters,
          model-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clustering</ENAMEX> has another advantage in providing
          posterior probabilities of observations belonging to each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>. The posterior probabilities are calculated using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>), and are presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
          Recall that a gene is classified to a cluster if its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> probability of being in the cluster is the
          largest. From Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, it can be seen that if a gene's 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistic has a large absolute
          value, then it will be classified into cluster 1.
          Specifically, if a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistic, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          
            i 
           , is smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-6.54</NUMEX> or larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.39</NUMEX>, then
          the corresponding gene 
          i is judged to be from cluster 1.
          Hence, cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> consists of genes with large absolute
          values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -statistics, implying that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cluster 1</ENAMEX> corresponds to genes with large changes of
          expression levels (after standardization by the variation
          of expression levels).
          Furthermore, the posterior probability can serve as a
          quantitative measurement of the strength of each gene
          being classified into each cluster. For instance, among
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> classified into the first cluster, there are
          respectively <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 20</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with a posterior
          probability of being in the first cluster greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.90</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>. Hence, those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 or 18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          are likely to have expression levels significantly
          different from those of other majority genes. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> probability might also provide information
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> possible misclassifications. In addition to those
          classified into cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, there might be other
          observations classified into the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters but
          nevertheless with not too small probabilities of being
          classified into cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The lower right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of
          Figure 4shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> such observations, all belonging to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cluster 2</ENAMEX> but with probabilities of being in cluster 1
          ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.48</NUMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> show somewhat
          differential gene-expression levels, but the evidence is
          not strong and more experiments may be needed to verify
          this.
          We hope we have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clustering</ENAMEX> is a
          powerful method that is useful in analyzing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression data. It is flexible as well as
          intuitively understandable. However, it does have some
          limitations. Although it provides posterior probabilities
          for classification results, in the context of detecting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes its use is more in the
          line of exploratory data analyses. For instance, in our
          example, we treat cluster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> as representing genes with
          changed expression whereas clusters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX> consist of
          genes without expression changes. Although this treatment
          is reasonable, it is somewhat subjective and is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">debatable</ENAMEX>. Some new statistical approaches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32, 33</TIMEX>]
          are interesting alternatives that provide a more
          quantitative answer to detecting genes with altered
          expression, but they require replicates of spots or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. Model-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clustering</ENAMEX> is less restrictive and
          can be applied to data without replicates and to cluster
          (relative) gene-expression levels directly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Materials and methods
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogen</ENAMEX>-free Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were
        inoculated with pneumococcus in phosphate-buffered saline
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) and served as the pneumococcus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats inoculated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> served as controls. All animals
        were sacrificed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 42</TIMEX> after inoculation. The bullae
        from each of the pneumococcus- or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>-inoculated groups
        were pooled and submitted for mRNA purification. Purified
        mRNAs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">[α - 32P</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dATP</ENAMEX>, dNTP mix and reverse transcriptase
        were incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 min</TIMEX> for the synthesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radioactively</ENAMEX> labeled cDNA probes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlas</ENAMEX> cDNA array
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> 1.2 array, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clontech</ENAMEX>, CA) were
        hybridized with the cDNA probes and nonspecific binding
        washed away. Specific binding of cDNA probes with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> was scanned into a computer and the radioactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensities of specific binding were quantitated
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OptiQant</ENAMEX> software (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DeltaPackard</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) and presented in digitalized light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (DLU).
        The intensity level in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLU</ENAMEX> is the observed gene-expression
        level. As described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the log-transformation was
        conducted on the intensity level in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLU</ENAMEX>, and the centering
        and scaling procedures were followed using the
        log-transformed data. The original data representing the
        intensity level (in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLU</ENAMEX>) for each gene from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        experiments are available from our website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
