          Health-environment relationships
          Knowledge about possible relationships between human
          health and the environment is garnered in several ways.
          Laboratory studies explore how and whether toxic
          compounds cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> at the organismic level.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies seek to identify whether 
          risk factors , such as diet,
          socio-economic status and occupation, are associated with
          specific outcomes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, in human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. With the advent of more detailed
          environmental data from remote sensing, toxic release
          inventories, and monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, the possibility of
          undertaking studies that relate geographic patterns in
          health outcomes to geographic patterns in environmental
          factors is now possible. Such studies seek to identify
          clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and to relate the locations of those
          clusters to geographic patterns in environmental factors
          that might have caused the disease. Like other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies, pattern analysis cannot
          establish causality. It can determine whether and where
          there is a statistical excess (or deficit) of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,
          and whether locations of elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> are
          geographically associated with areas where plausible risk
          factors also are high. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susser</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] call for
          an integration of several levels of research, from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecular</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, to the societal, because
          factors on each of these levels often interact to cause
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic disease</ENAMEX>.
          Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is to
          illustrate how geographic pattern analysis can increase
          our understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>, lung and colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. Critical to this understanding
          is an appreciation of the assumptions, caveats, and
          limitations of the geographical approach and of this
          study in particular. While presented last, these
          considerations should be kept firmly in mind when making
          any kind of inference or decision from this study's
          results.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geographic Pattern Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Pattern recognition plays an important role in data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">summarization</ENAMEX> and description by identifying salient
          features and structure in the data. By asking a carefully
          crafted series of pattern analysis questions it is
          possible to evaluate specific hypotheses regarding the
          geographic patterns of disease in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
          These hypotheses correspond to questions regarding 
          value , 
          change and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> .
          • 
          Value questions have to do with the
          values of the variables surveyed, and how they are
          arranged in geographic space. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Disease clustering</ENAMEX> is
          principally concerned with value questions such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is</ENAMEX>
          there an excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>?" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Where</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> rates
          significantly high?"
          • 
          Change questions have to do with
          how values vary through geographic space and through
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Change questions include "Where do <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> rates
          change rapidly?" and "Where do air toxics change rapidly
          in geographic space?"
          • 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> questions relate
          spatial pattern in one variable or set of variables to
          the pattern in another set of variables.
          Example association questions include "Is spatial
          pattern in health outcomes associated with:
          • The environment? (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental</ENAMEX>, occupational, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">food-borne</ENAMEX> exposures),
          • Population? (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demography</ENAMEX>, marriage, birth, ethnicity)
          and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">• Individual</ENAMEX>? (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics</ENAMEX>, behavior, individual risk
          factors)?"
          In this set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies we address <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> questions
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> breast, lung and colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Where are the statistically significant excesses
          and deficits of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>? This value question is answered
          using disease clustering techniques in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Where are the zones of rapid change (boundaries) in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer incidence</ENAMEX>? This change question is answered using
          geographic boundary analysis.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Is geographic pattern in cancer incidence related
          to geographic patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen concentrations</ENAMEX> as
          modeled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Air Toxics Assessment</ENAMEX> program?
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> question is evaluated using boundary
          overlap analysis.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer Incidence</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York State Department of Health</ENAMEX> (NYSDOH)
            published the cancer incidence data online as part of
            their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancer Surveillance Improvement Initiative</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>health.state.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ny.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">us/nysdoh/cancer/csii/nyscsii.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm.</ENAMEX>
            These data represent newly diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases in
            the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993-7</TIMEX> assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s residence
            at diagnosis, and they are calculated as the number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> for each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. When
            we began this study (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSDOH</ENAMEX> had
            released data on three <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> (female only),
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colorectal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and male), and lung (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> and
            male) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>.
            To protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> privacy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSDOH</ENAMEX> data provided
            case counts referenced to ZIP codes rather than
            individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX>. While ZIP codes are somewhat
            arbitrary spatial units of analysis with respect to
            potential health and environmental factors, they
            provide a convenient way to group the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and
            preserve confidentiality. We combined this dataset with
            ZIP code boundary files, reflecting the geography in
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX>. We purchased the boundary files from
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Claritas Corporation http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">claritas</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. While the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSDOH</ENAMEX> provides information on the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, we
            focus on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">214</NUMEX> ZIP codes within <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nassau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> move between ZIP codes and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> latency
            (the time between causative exposures and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> onset)
            is long, so the ZIP code where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was
            diagnosed may not be the location where the cancer
            developed nor where causative exposures occurred. We do
            not include any adjustments for migration or changes in
            any demographic patterns within the study area.
            While the observed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis data did adjust
            for different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations-at-risk</ENAMEX> in the different ZIP
            codes, we also used <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX>'s adjustment for
            different age patterns as well. Because cancer
            incidence is related to age, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYSDOH</ENAMEX> calculated the
            expected cancer incidence for each ZIP code using the
            ZIP code's age structure and the average incidence by
            age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX>. We calculated a
            standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) by dividing the
            observed value by the age-adjusted expected incidence.
            An SMR value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> indicates that the observed
            incidence is the same as expected, lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
            indicates that fewer than expected cases of cancer
            occurred, and greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> indicates that more than
            expected occurred.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Air Toxics Assessment</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA National Air Toxics Assessment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">epa.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/ttn/atw/nata/</ENAMEX>) combines information
            on point and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonpoint</ENAMEX> emissions of air toxics and
            weather information into an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment System</ENAMEX> for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population Exposure Nationwide</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPEN</ENAMEX>). We obtained
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPEN</ENAMEX> model <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> base-year data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Feb 2001</ENAMEX> run). The
            exposure data is approximately concurrent with the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> study period, thereby precluding any
            cause-and-effect interpretation, as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> developed
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> could not have been caused by air toxics in
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. Because of the latency in the development of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, it would not even be plausible to say that the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1996</ENAMEX> data could explain only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> diagnoses. Yet, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1996</ENAMEX> data may be representative of the air toxics prior
            to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> such a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> geographic exposure model was available
            from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>. As this is an opportunistic analysis,
            we took the data available. We thereby assume the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are reasonable representations of air pollution in
            the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">preceding decade</TIMEX> during which causative exposures
            might have occurred. This assumption seems reasonable
            for air pollution <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that have been in operation
            since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, and whose dispersal is mediated by
            transport mechanisms (e.g. prevailing winds) that
            haven't changed a great deal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 10-20 years</TIMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASPEN</ENAMEX> model estimates the average annual
            concentration of a series of known air toxics for all
            census tracts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. We used concentrations of
            only those air toxics thought to be potential
            carcinogens for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>). This
            list by no means constitutes an exhaustive list of
            potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carcinogens</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>. For the purposes
            of this study, the compounds in this list were deemed
            the most plausible carcinogens and exposure to these
            compounds was combined into a single risk measure, the
            overall predicted risk (OPR), defined below (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equation</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
            As exposure to each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> has a different risk,
            we standardized the exposure by multiplying the
            estimated average annual concentration of each compound
            by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unit Risk Estimate</ENAMEX> (URE) as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Equation</ENAMEX> 1.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URE</ENAMEX> is the lifetime risk of excess <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases
            predicted to come from continuous exposure to a
            compound at a concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 μg/m 3in</ENAMEX> the air (for
            more information see definition on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX> website,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">epa.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/ttn/atw/nata/gloss1.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX> may
            under- or over-estimate the actual risk of exposure to
            these compounds, as the predictions are extrapolations
            from tests in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and/or the effects of low doses.
            All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX> are from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Draft USEPA NATA</ENAMEX> report [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ,
            except that for diesel particulate matter. The USEPA
            has not yet defined a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URE</ENAMEX> for diesel and so we used the
            midpoint of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URE</ENAMEX> range from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California EPA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
            . To calculate exposure for each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> we used the
            following formula:
            
            Exposure × 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URE</ENAMEX> = 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CancerRisk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 1</ENAMEX>)
            We obtained the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> estimated exposure from the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX> dataset, and used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URE</ENAMEX> values from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 7to
            obtain estimates of excess <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases due to that
            exposure. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URE</ENAMEX> is a risk estimate for all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
            rather than a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-specific figure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> for each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is likely an overestimate of risk for an
            individual <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
            The use of a national-scale assessment to predict
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk based on air toxics is subject to caveats
            that have been identified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>:
            "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX> used in the national-scale assessment are
            subject to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major areas of variability and
            uncertainty. First, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> were
            classified as probable carcinogens because data were
            not sufficient to prove causality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. It is
            possible that some of these pollutants do not cause
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> at environmentally relevant doses, and that true
            risk associated with these air toxics is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
            all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX> in this study were based on linear
            extrapolation from high to low doses. It is possible
            that the true dose response relationships for some
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pollutants</ENAMEX> may be less than linear, resulting in an
            overestimate of risk. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, most UREs in this study
            were developed from animal data using conservative
            methods to extrapolate between species. Human responses
            may differ from the predicted ones. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are comprised entirely of uncertainty. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>,
            most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX> in this study were based on statistical upper
            confidence limits, though some were based on
            statistical best fits. (While this does not affect
            overall uncertainty, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX> based on best fits should be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unbiased</ENAMEX>, while those based on upper confidence limits
            should be biased high.) This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> element represents
            a combination of variability (i.e., based on variation
            responses of different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>) and
            uncertainty (i.e., potential errors in the measurement
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> and response). Because of the aggregate
            treatment all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of variability and
            uncertainty described above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> considers all its UREs
            to be upper-bound estimates."

            Regarding the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX>, one should note that the
            methods employed are sensitive to the relative, rather
            than absolute value, of the risk estimates. By focusing
            on boundaries, we are able to identify spatial
            structure and geographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> so long as the
            relative values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPRs</ENAMEX> are correct. Hence the
            methods employed will yield the same results for a
            biased risk estimator - provided the bias on average is
            the same for all observed values. We also note the UREs
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7are</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> combined, and not for
            site-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. Our analysis identified
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compounds</ENAMEX> thought to be carcinogens for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
            site-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> we considered, and then
            calculated a site-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">URE</ENAMEX> based on the values in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>. Ideally, one should use site-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UREs</ENAMEX>,
            but these are not yet available from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>.
            We calculated an overall predicted risk from air
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxics</ENAMEX> (OPR) for each <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by summing up the excess
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases for each of the relevant compounds as
            shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Equation</ENAMEX> 2.
            Σ 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CancerRisk</ENAMEX> = 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 2</ENAMEX>)
            Summing up the excess <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases for all of the
            relevant compounds assumes an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> relationship -
            that particular compounds do not interact in a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synergistic</ENAMEX> or threshold-related manner to influence
            dose-response relationships. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> is currently using
            an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> model for assessing dose and response to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple compounds</ENAMEX>, but further research needs to be
            done to confirm the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> model or else replace it
            with a more appropriate model. Again, pattern
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> approaches are useful under this kind of
            uncertainty since they are relatively robust provided
            the rank order of the estimates is "about right."
          
        
        
          Local <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Boundary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subboundary Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Borders where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> change a great deal may indicate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> where causative exposures change through geographic
          space, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> are unstable, and/or where local
          populations differing in cancer incidence abut. The
          identification of such borders may provide insight into
          the causes, correlates and uncertainties in cancer
          incidence. To detect local boundaries we used the Womble
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wombling</ENAMEX> identifies those locations with
          the highest local rates of change (measured by squared
          Euclidean distance between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> values in adjacent ZIP
          codes). We used a gradient value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>, so the
          top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of all local rates of change in the dataset were
          called boundaries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wombling</ENAMEX> has been applied to raster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] and point data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . It was extended
          to polygon data by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Maruca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Jacquez</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BoundarySeer</ENAMEX> software
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terraseer</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/boundaryseer.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. To our
          knowledge, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> application of
          this new wombling approach.
          Because choosing a boundary threshold value is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjective</ENAMEX>, we evaluated the boundaries detected
          statistically through subboundary analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . For
          each defined set of boundaries we calculated the number
          of singletons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ns</ENAMEX>, mean boundary length <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lmean</ENAMEX>, mean
          maximum boundary length <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lmax</ENAMEX>, mean boundary diameter, and
          mean maximum boundary diameter. We will report <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns, Lmean</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lmax</ENAMEX>. We then evaluated the probability of the
          observed value of each subboundary statistic against the
          null hypothesis of no spatial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the underlying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> (either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SMR</ENAMEX> or OPR) through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomizations</ENAMEX>. In these randomizations, the observed SMR
          values were randomized across the ZIP codes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>. With equations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 & 4</NUMEX>, these statistics can be
          evaluated as excessively high (significant upper tail
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P↑</ENAMEX>, when the observed value is significantly
          higher than those in the reference distribution) or as
          excessively low (significant lower tail p-value or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P↓</ENAMEX>,
          when the observed value is significantly lower than those
          in the reference distribution). Thus the statistics can
          be interpreted to identify statistical evidence of
          boundary cohesiveness (longer boundaries than expected by
          chance high <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lmean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lmax</ENAMEX> and low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX>) or fragmentation
          (shorter boundaries than expected by chance low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lmean</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lmax</ENAMEX> and low <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ns - P↑</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boundary Overlap Analysis</ENAMEX>
          To assess the association between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boundaries</ENAMEX> (e.g. cancer incidence (SMR) boundaries and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk (OPR) boundaries) we used boundary overlap
          statistics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . We evaluated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> statistics of
          boundary overlap based on the average minimum distance
          from boundaries in one variable (e.g. SMR) to the nearest
          boundary in the other variable (e.g. OPR). They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Os</ENAMEX>,
          Og, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ogh</ENAMEX>, and Oh. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Os</ENAMEX> is the count of the number of
          boundary locations that are included in both sets of
          boundaries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Og</ENAMEX> is the mean distance from the boundaries
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> variable (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) to the nearest boundary location in
          another boundary set (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>). Oh is the mean distance from h
          to the nearest point in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g. Ogh</ENAMEX> is the mean distance from
          locations in either boundary to the nearest location in
          the other
          We obtained a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value through equations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 & 4</NUMEX> for
          the observed overlap by comparing the observed values of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> statistics to those generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomizations</ENAMEX>. BoundarySeer randomized the variables
          considered (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> and/or OPR), recalculated the
          boundaries, and then recalculated the overlap statistics.
          The null hypothesis for this randomization approach is
          that boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> are independent (not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX>) with boundaries in cancer risk. Like the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subboundary</ENAMEX> statistics, these overlap statistics can be
          evaluated as significantly closer (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">high Os</ENAMEX>, low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Og</ENAMEX>, Oh,
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogh</ENAMEX>) or significantly farther than expected by chance
          (low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Os</ENAMEX>, high <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Og</ENAMEX>, Oh, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogh</ENAMEX>).
          Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> data were assigned to
          different geographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (ZIP codes and census tracts,
          respectively) we would almost never expect overlap of SMR
          boundaries and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> boundaries to result in significantly
          high Os, as Os depends on the exact location of the
          boundaries. The other statistics are minimum distances,
          and so are more reasonable measures of coincidence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          sets of boundaries detected on different geographic units
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">e.g.</TIMEX> census tracts vs. ZIP codes).
        
        
          Calculating p-values
          Upper and lower p-values provide a sense of how
          extreme the observed values of the subboundary and
          overlap statistics are compared to the reference
          distribution of values obtained by randomization. The
          formulae for calculating these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values are:
          
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nruns</ENAMEX> is the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGE</ENAMEX> is the number of simulations greater
          than or equal to the observed value of the statistic, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLE</ENAMEX> is the number of simulations less than or equal to
          the observed value of the statistic.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX>
            Boundaries in female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> are shown in
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Our analysis identified those ZIP code edges
            where cancer incidence changes the most. In general,
            the boundaries in female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> circumscribe
            or partially surround only one ZIP code. This pattern
            is consistent with the smaller-scale clustering found
            for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females relative</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> under the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX>
            test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . For example, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> clusters of
            female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, each comprised of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 3 to 4</TIMEX>
            ZIP codes [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>], vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> clusters of male
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, each comprised of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 3 to 7</TIMEX> ZIP
            codes [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>]. These smaller clusters indicate
            that geographic clustering of female colorectal cancer
            occurs at a smaller spatial scale than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. This
            finding is further substantiated by subboundary
            analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), which found the boundaries in
            female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> to be significantly
            fragmented. There are significantly more singleton
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boundaries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX> larger than expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.032</NUMEX>), while
            the boundaries are shorter (significantly low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lmean</ENAMEX>, P↓
            = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.032</NUMEX>) than is expected under this null
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Males
            Boundaries in male colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> are shown in
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and identify margins of ZIP codes that differ
            substantially in cancer incidence from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>.
            These indicate not only the zones of high variation in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer incidence</ENAMEX> that are expected at the margins of
            the significant clusters occurring under the local
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , but also highly local boundaries
            indicative of spatial variation in incidence at small
            spatial scales. Several boundaries appear to be long,
            and connect several ZIP codes; others are quite short
            and are comprised only of part of the margin of a ZIP
            code. Under subboundary analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the
            boundaries, as a whole, were found to be neither
            significantly long nor significantly fragmented. We
            believe this result is consistent with an overall
            pattern of boundary fragmentation in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>, and cohesive boundaries around the large-scale
            clusters occurring on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-</TIMEX> to eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>. This
            finding suggests that the determinants of colorectal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> operate on increasingly larger spatial scales as
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> moves from west to east.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
            Colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> has both dietary and genetic
            determinants, in addition to other risk factors such as
            age and smoking. Because diet is strongly influenced by
            the family environment, one might expect the incidence
            of male and female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> to covary. To
            explore this expectation we generated bivariate plots
            of male vs. female <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), and
            also conducted a boundary overlap analysis. The scatter
            plot suggests little, if any, association between male
            and female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer incidence</ENAMEX>.
            Now consider the map of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female colorectal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boundaries</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> areas the female
            colorectal boundaries (yellow) overlap the male
            colorectal boundaries (orange) exactly, displayed as a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow</ENAMEX> line with orange margins. These boundaries have
            significant exact overlap (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Os P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.012</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
            Further, the average minimum distance between the male
            and female colorectal boundaries was significantly
            smaller than expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogh P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.016</NUMEX>). While the
            locations of male boundaries in colorectal cancer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tended</ENAMEX>, on average, to occur near boundaries in female
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Og P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.024</NUMEX>) boundaries in female
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were not necessarily near boundaries
            in male colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (Oh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.152</NUMEX>). These
            results are indicative of the ability of overlap
            statistics to detect common spatial variation patterns
            even when the observed correlation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            variables is weak. Despite the substantial 'noise' in
            the plot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> vs. female colorectal cancer incidence
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), overlap analysis revealed the geographic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> expected given common exposures among males
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> or attributable to similar diet and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX> within family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.

            Subboundary analysis
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6is</NUMEX> the map of boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> for
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, overlaid with boundaries in
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk (OPR) and boundaries in the
            incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The
            boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> are significant and cohesive, being
            longer and having fewer singletons than expected under
            the null hypothesis. The number of subboundaries were
            significantly fewer than expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The boundaries were significantly long (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lmean P↑</ENAMEX> =
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lmax P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). In total, these results
            indicate boundaries that are significantly longer and
            more cohesive than is expected by chance, and suggests
            that spatial variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> for colorectal cancer
            occurs on relatively large spatial scales. This outcome
            is consistent with the model used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> that
            incorporates both point- and area-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> into the air
            quality model.
          
          
            Overlap analysis
            Boundary overlap analysis determined whether zones
            of rapid change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> are significantly associated
            with boundaries in colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR. If the air
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">toxics</ENAMEX> modeled in the NATA database are indeed strongly
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with colorectal cancer risk, then we would
            expect boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> to be significantly close to
            boundaries in colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR. Accordingly, an
            overlap analysis was undertaken for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and
            female colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. For female colorectal cancer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SMR</ENAMEX> we found overlap avoidance: boundaries in female
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence are further from boundaries
            in colorectal OPR than is expected by chance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
            Taking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> as a whole, the average minimum
            distance from a boundary in female colorectal cancer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> to the nearest boundary in colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> is
            significantly larger (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Og P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>) than its expected
            value. The same result obtains for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, where the
            average minimum distance from a boundary in male
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR to the nearest boundary in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colorectal</ENAMEX> is significantly larger (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Og P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>) than
            its expected value.
            When considering these statistical results with the
            maps in Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2</ENAMEX>, the source of overlap avoidance
            is apparent. The majority of boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> are
            found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Long Island</ENAMEX>, in urban areas,
            suggesting that a greater number of point source
            emissions are causing greater spatial variation in OPR
            in more urban areas. In fact, the eastern-most boundary
            in colorectal OPR occurs in the vicinity of Greenlawn
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ZIP 11740</ENAMEX>), while boundaries in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female
            colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR are found as far east as
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wainscott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fishers Island</ENAMEX>. Thus while overlap
            avoidance occurs on the scale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> as a
            whole, further investigation is needed to evaluate
            whether overlap occurs specifically in urban areas
            where there is a great deal of local scale variation in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colorectal OPR</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breast Cancer</ENAMEX>
          We conducted a local boundary analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) to
          identify the edges of ZIP codes where female breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence changes rapidly. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR subboundaries are not statistically
          remarkable. The number of subboundaries is near its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.800</NUMEX>). These subboundaries have
          lengths near what would be expected by chance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lmean P↑</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.800</NUMEX>,).
          We found spatial pattern in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          distinct spatial scales. The first scale is at the level
          of the individual ZIP code, resulting in the spatial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX> described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> scale
          occurs across adjacent ZIP codes, resulting in clusters
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more ZIP codes found under the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX>
          test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The spatial scale of the pattern gives us
          some insights into the likely spatial scale of the
          generating process. For example, it seems unlikely that
          spatial outliers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> would result from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogen</ENAMEX>,
          such as an airborne toxic, dispersed over a large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> area. At the same time, we wouldn't expect a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> to result from a highly
          localized exposure. Thus, if we are to use spatial
          pattern in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR as a clue to underlying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causative</ENAMEX> exposures, we will need to consider exposure
          mechanisms that operate at both small (sub ZIP code) and
          local (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bridging 3-7 ZIP codes</ENAMEX>) spatial scales.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subboundary Analysis</ENAMEX>
            The boundaries in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> OPR are significant
            and cohesive, being longer and having fewer singleton
            boundaries than expected by chance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
            number of subboundaries is significantly fewer than
            expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). Both the mean and maximum
            boundary length were longer, on average, than expected
            by chance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lmean P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lmax P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). These
            results indicate boundaries that are significantly
            longer and more cohesive than is expected by
            chance.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overlap Analysis</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Comparing Figure 9to Figure 3in</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , we located
            several areas of high OPR for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> near the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of low breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence identified in
            the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX> analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . We also note the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of high breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR found on southeastern
            Long <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX> is in an area of low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OPR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Based on
            map inspection, overall there appears to be a negative
            relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence so
            that clusters of high breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence occur
            where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> is low, and clusters of low incidence occur
            where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> is high. This result based on visual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspection</ENAMEX> is supported by the statistical analysis of
            boundary overlap (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">below</NUMEX>).
            Boundary overlap analysis was used to determine
            whether boundaries in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> OPR were closer to
            boundaries in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR than one would expect
            were these variables independent. If breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR
            indeed is increased in those locations where the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airborne toxics</ENAMEX> underlying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
            are elevated, then we should expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> and breast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer SMR</ENAMEX> to have similar spatial patterns, and their
            boundaries should be significantly close to one
            another. We undertook a boundary overlap analysis to
            evaluate this hypothesis. Taking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> as a
            whole, the boundaries in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR are further
            away from boundaries in OPR than one would expect by
            chance (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The observed average
            minimum distance from a boundary in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR
            to a boundary in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> was significantly higher than
            expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Og P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). Thus boundaries in breast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> avoided boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OPR</ENAMEX> such that one tends to
            find boundaries in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in locations where
            there aren't boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX>. This finding is
            consistent with the observed locations for the larger,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple ZIP code breast cancer</ENAMEX> SMR clusters found
            under with the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX> test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and the
            singleton clusters found by the local boundary
            analysis. There thus appears to be boundary avoidance,
            so that zones of rapid change in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
            incidence aren't found near zones of rapid change in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX>; and an inverse relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX>,
            so that high values of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> incidence tend not
            to be found where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> is high.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lung Cancer</ENAMEX>
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX>
            Boundaries in female lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR are shown in
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. These boundaries are the margins of abutting
            ZIP codes with very different lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR values.
            When we consider <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX> as a whole, these
            boundaries are neither significantly fragmented nor
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX>. Indeed each of the subboundary statistics
            we examined - the number of singleton boundaries (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns</ENAMEX>)
            and boundary mean and minimum length (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lmean, Lmax</ENAMEX>) -
            were not significantly different from the values
            expected under the null hypothesis of a random
            geographic distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> values (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). This
            implies that when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX> is considered as a whole,
            spatial processes that lead to boundary generation or
            to boundary fragmentation are either absent or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">countervailing</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Males
            Boundaries in male lung cancer incidence are shown
            in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. These are expected to indicate not only
            the margins of the clusters identified under the local
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> test [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , but also the margins of singleton
            ZIP codes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> values that differ substantially
            from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. It is interesting to observe the
            high singleton ZIP codes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockaways, Brightwaters</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX>) are along the southern shore.
            Like female lung cancer incidence, the boundaries in
            male lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> appear to be a mixture of long
            boundaries demarcating the large-scale clusters
            identified under the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX> test, and
            smaller-scale boundaries circumscribing singleton ZIP
            codes whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> differ substantially from their
            immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. Not surprisingly, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX>
            is considered in its entirety the boundaries in lung
            male cancer incidence are neither significantly long
            nor significantly fragmented under subboundary analysis
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). Because both spatial outliers ZIP codes as
            well as large-scale clusters were found, this result
            suggests that boundary-generating processes are acting
            at both local (within ZIP codes) and large (across
            several ZIP codes) geographic scales.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX> and males
            It is known that smoking is a major determinant of
            lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and that smoking as a behavior tends to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and is associated with certain
            socio-demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. In addition, even when only
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household member</ENAMEX> smokes, the risk for lung cancer
            is elevated among other household <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> through
            "second hand" smoking. We thus might expect to find a
            correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female lung cancer
            incidence. This was explored via a scatter <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> and by
            boundary overlap analysis. The scatter <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>)
            suggests a weak but positive correlation between male
            and female lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR.
            Boundary overlap (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>) revealed that there is
            some overlap in male and female lung cancer boundaries,
            especially in the central portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX>, but
            this amount of overlap was not statistically
            significant under boundary overlap analysis when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX> is considered as a whole (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). This
            indicates that the geographic distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and
            female lung cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> differ and are possessed of
            boundaries whose placement appears independent. This
            implies the geographic determinants of lung cancer
            differ for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.

            Figure 14shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>, overlaid with
            boundaries in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> OPR. The boundaries in lung
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> OPR are significantly long and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). There are fewer boundaries composed of only one
            boundary element than is expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ns P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>) under
            the null hypothesis of no spatial pattern in lung
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> OPR values. The boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> also have a
            longer mean and maximum length than expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lmean</ENAMEX> P↑
            = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lmax P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>). This indicates that zones of
            rapid change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> values are long and contiguous.
            This result is consistent with the map of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> that
            shows a broad area of elevated risk in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overlap Analysis</ENAMEX>
            If the air toxics modeled in the NATA database were
            indeed associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>, then we would
            expect boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> to overlap boundaries in lung
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>). We found statistically significant
            overlap between boundaries in female lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). The average minimum distance from a
            boundary in female <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SMR</ENAMEX> to the nearest boundary in OPR
            is significantly smaller (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Og P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.044</NUMEX>) than the
            average minimum distance expected under a null
            hypothesis of no spatial pattern in both cancer
            incidence and overall predicted risk. While boundaries
            in female lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR were significantly close to
            boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX>, boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> are further from
            boundaries in female lung cancer incidence than is
            expected by chance (Oh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>). This result
            indicates that while boundaries in female lung cancer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> are most likely to occur near boundaries in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX> air toxics, boundaries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX> air toxics do
            not always occur near boundaries in female cancer
            incidence. This pattern of results is consistent with a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">causal</ENAMEX> model where female lung cancer depends on the
            overall predicted risk from the air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> modeled
            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX> dataset. However, it is not a demonstration
            of causality.
            A similar result obtains for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>), where
            the average minimum distance from a boundary in male
            lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR to the nearest boundary in lung cancer
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> is significantly smaller than its expected value
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Og P↓</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.044</NUMEX>). While boundaries in male lung cancer
            incidence are significantly near boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX>, the
            boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> are significantly farther from
            boundaries in male lung cancer incidence than is
            expected by chance (Oh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P↑</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>). As for female lung
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, this is consistent with a causal model where
            male lung cancer incidence depends on the overall
            predicted risk as estimated by the NATA database.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        To summarize, this geographic study found little or no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between the incidence of colorectal and breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> and the overall predicted risks from air toxics as
        modeled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Air Toxics Assessment Program</ENAMEX>. This
        study did find association between geographic patterns in
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and the overall
        predicted risks for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was found
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> levels by different statistical methods. First,
        clusters of statistically significant high and low lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer incidences</ENAMEX> were identified separately for both males
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> demonstrated a
        large cluster of high lung cancer incidence in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX>
        Island that corresponded approximately, in both geographic
        extent and location, to a broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of high overall lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk as predicted by the air toxics estimates.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the appearance of an association on maps is of
        course subjective when only the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> is employed, and
        we further assessed statistical validity of map pattern
        using geographic boundary analysis. Boundary analysis found
        that boundaries in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female lung cancer
        incidence are significantly near to boundaries in overall
        predicted risk, and that, while boundaries in lung cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX> tend to always be near boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX>, boundaries in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> are not necessarily near to boundaries in cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SMR</ENAMEX>.
        This is consistent with a causal model where geographic
        pattern in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is determined, at least in part, by
        geographic pattern in the overall predicted risk due to air
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxics</ENAMEX>.
        Demonstration of a causal relationship between exposure
        to the modeled air toxics and lung cancer incidence clearly
        is beyond the inferential ability of this study. While
        consistent with a causal relationship between air toxics
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>, these results do not demonstrate the
        existence of a causal relationship. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX> air
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dataset models</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> exposure, while the cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dataset</ENAMEX> covers the period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993-7</TIMEX>. We cannot argue that
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> modeled exposure caused 1993 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. However, if the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1996</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is consistent with geographic variation in
        exposures to air toxics in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> (a time
        period that includes the latency of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>), a
        causal relationship cannot be precluded. This is an
        opportunistic analysis, taking advantage of existing
        publicly available historical data, and for which the ideal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> do not exist. Now that geographic variation has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX>, additional explanatory variables such as
        smoking incidence, socioeconomic status, education,
        occupation and ethnicity (each of which is known to be an
        important determinant of lung cancer incidence and/or
        smoking behavior) can be incorporated into the analysis. We
        also note that examination of spatial outliers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> for
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> found that these outliers were not necessarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with elevated lung cancer risk.
        The results from this study can be used to guide further
        investigation, especially to identify areas where the
        associations between boundaries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> and in lung cancer
        incidence are strongest. By map inspection (refer to Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>) these areas of strong boundary overlap include the
        vicinities of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Locust Valley</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11560</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mill Neck</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11765</ENAMEX>);
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11716</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Islip Terrace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11752</ENAMEX>); and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mastic Beach</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11951</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11967</ENAMEX>). Each of these is a "zone of
        rapid change" where both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer morbidity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPR</ENAMEX> change
        dramatically over a relatively short distance. By focusing
        future inquiry on locations where boundaries in both cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and the putative exposure overlap, we should be
        able to better identify the local- as well as large-scale
        determinants of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        
          Ecologic fallacy, location uncertainty and the use
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> as an exposure surrogate
          This study demonstrated the existence of statistically
          significant clusters of both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> excess and deficit [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . The evaluation of geographic clusters must include
          consideration of potentially misleading aspects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecologic</ENAMEX> studies. ZIP codes and census tracts are a
          coarse spatial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> for aggregating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases and for
          estimating individual exposure to air toxics. The ZIP
          codes and census tracts also are measured at different
          spatial scales, although this is controlled for in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> tests by employing randomization procedures
          based on ZIP code and census tract geography. In the long
          term, other spatial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> may be more appropriate for
          estimating environmental exposure - watersheds, aquifers,
          or local public water systems for water-borne <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>,
          or "windsheds" for airborne <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. Yet, because of
          privacy concerns for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the limitations on
          existing environmental data, we used the available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
          Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ZIP code</ENAMEX> of residence at diagnosis is an
          inadequate descriptor of an individual's location during
          the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ZIP code</ENAMEX> of
          residence assumes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> lived within that ZIP code
          area during the period of time required to develop cancer
          following exposure to an environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> that
          influenced cancer risk. Hence the degree of exposure to
          the potential risk factors over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a multi-year period</TIMEX> has
          been estimated for each study subject based on their
          place of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, aggregated at the census tract level.
          This assumption is clearly tenuous given the mobility of
          the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> may have
          worked and spent a great deal of time in another area.
          The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> as a surrogate for exposure clearly
          is invalid whenever causative exposures largely occur
          outside of the home - for this study "outside of the
          home" means in a different ZIP code zone.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confounders</ENAMEX> and covariates
          This study accounted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> but ignored other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounders</ENAMEX> and covariates such as socioeconomic status,
          occupation, risk behaviors (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX> and diet) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethnicity</ENAMEX>. No attempt was made to account for genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predispositions</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> that are known to be associated
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s heritage. Thus the spatial patterns we
          observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> SMR's could be caused by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> variation in these confounders and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariates</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer latency</ENAMEX> and migration
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> explored are known to have long latencies
          on the order of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 to 20 years</TIMEX>, depending on the
          causative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> and the subject's genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposition</ENAMEX>. Over such a time span the average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> moves several times, tending to obscure whatever
          geographic relationships may exist between environmental
          exposure and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer incidence</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Higher-order interactions
          We used boundary overlap analysis to assess potential
          bivariate association between risk estimates and cancer
          incidence. Especially for complex relationships (such as
          those between environment and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>), apparent bivariate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> may be driven by multivariate interactions
          that are not directly quantified by the two variables
          under scrutiny. For example, elevated air pollution may
          lead to lower housing prices, which in turn attracts
          poorer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> with higher smoking rates. In this
          instance, an observed bivariate correlation between air
          pollution and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> would not be indicative of the
          underlying causal mechanism.
