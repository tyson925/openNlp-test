        Renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> are at high risk for
        post-transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>. However, information on
        the incidence and risk factors for diabetic ketoacidosis
        (diabetic ketoacidosis) after solid organ transplantation
        has been limited to single-center reports. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ]
        There are even fewer reports on hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX>, previously
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nonketotic hyperosomolar coma</ENAMEX>) after renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] Recently, post-transplant diabetes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mellitus</ENAMEX> has been associated with tacrolimus use in renal
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody positivity</ENAMEX>,
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] although this experience is not universal. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] Only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> report of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tacrolimus</ENAMEX> use in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> without a prior history of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes</ENAMEX> has so far been reported. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tacrolimus</ENAMEX> was
        approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> for use in kidney transplantation in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. We therefore performed a historical cohort study of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Renal Data System</ENAMEX> (USRDS) Renal
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Our objectives were to determine the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX>, risk factors, and mortality associated with
        hospitalizations for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> (primary
        hospitalization discharge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ICD9</TIMEX> code 250.1x) and
        hyperglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ICD9</TIMEX> code 250.2x)
        occurring after renal transplantation.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patient Population</ENAMEX>
          This study used data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Renal Data</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System</ENAMEX> (USRDS), using standard analysis files (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>'s) as
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2000</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX>, indirectly mandated by federal
          law, incorporates baseline and follow-up demographic and
          clinical data on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving end stage renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (ESRD) therapy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. ESRD therapy
          includes hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>. Because patient entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> is
          linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> reimbursement, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> services are
          expensive, very few transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are not
          represented in the database. The variables included in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> standard analysis files (SAF), as well as data
          collection methods and validation studies, are listed at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> website, under 'Researcher's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX> to the USRDS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Database'</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section E</ENAMEX>, 'Contents of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>'s,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">usrds</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organd</ENAMEX> published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX>. The
          demographics of the renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> have been
          previously described (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> USRDS report). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TXUNOS</ENAMEX> was
          used as the primary dataset, and merged with variables
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOSP</ENAMEX> for hospitalization data, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PATIENTS</ENAMEX>
          for dates and causes of death as well as causes of renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, as previously reported. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] Patient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and treatment factors were those at the
          date of transplant. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Recipients</ENAMEX> of organs other than
          kidneys were excluded.
        
        
          Outcome Definition
          We conducted a historical cohort study of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX>, risk factors and associated patient survival
          for hospitalized cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> (based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Diseases-9th Modification</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diagnosis Codes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ICD9</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> discharge for diabetic
          ketoacidosis, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250.1x</TIMEX>, and hyperosmotic hyperosmolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> (also known as non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma),
          ICD9 code <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250.2x</TIMEX>, as a primary discharge diagnosis in
          renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. The first hospitalization
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> after the first solitary renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transplant</ENAMEX> (thus excluding kidney-pancreas or other
          multiple transplants) for a given individual occurring on
          or after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 July 1994</TIMEX> and before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 July 1998</TIMEX> (which
          included repeat transplants), with follow-up time
          truncated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> was counted in analysis.
          Hospitalizations were chosen because they were more
          accessible in the database and less subject to
          interpretation than outpatient cases of diabetic
          ketoacidosis, especially since the USRDS database has no
          information on confirmatory studies. Hospitalization data
          for transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> may be unreliable after the
          patient has survived <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â‰¥</ENAMEX> 3 years post transplant, when
          hospitalization reporting to Medicare for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> or younger is no longer required. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
          reporting starts immediately after transplant, regardless
          of preceding dialysis status. All hospitalizations with a
          primary discharge diagnosis for diabetic ketoacidosis
          were extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAF</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOSP</ENAMEX>, merged with the transplant
          file using unique identifiers, and hospitalizations
          outside the range of the study period were excluded.
          Hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis occurring at
          any time after renal transplant, including after graft
          failure (censored for patient death), were counted in
          analysis.
        
        
          Variables used in analysis
          The independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> factors
          and hospitalizations for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> were
          examined using multivariate analysis with stepwise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
          Regression including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, recipient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>, gender, weight, pretransplant dialysis (yes/no),
          duration of dialysis prior to transplantation, total
          follow-up time, recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C serology, donor
          cytomegalovirus serology, pre-transplant dialysis
          (yes/no), rejection (either treatment or diagnosis)
          occurring at any time in the study period, induction
          antibody therapy, maintenance immunosuppressive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of discharge after transplant
          surgery, graft loss, and cause of end stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal disease</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX>, either <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> or other causes). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX> does
          not reliably distinguish between type I and type II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have used the occurrence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX> as a
          surrogate for type I <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13</NUMEX>) However, given the
          growing frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II diabetes</ENAMEX> in younger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX>) we did not think this assumption would be
          valid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more recent years</TIMEX> of the database. We therefore
          chose to group all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESRD</ENAMEX> due to diabetes
          together. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes</ENAMEX> as a comorbid condition at the time of
          listing for transplant was also used as a variable,
          although information on this variable was missing or
          unknown for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.3%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>).
          Information on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> dependence was missing for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, however, and was not considered reliable for
          analysis. Episodes of rejection were not restricted to
          those occurring in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX>, in contrast to studies
          of allograft function, since there is no evidence that
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late</TIMEX> (vs. early) rejection has a different impact on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> ketoacidosis. However, only episodes of diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome
          occurring after the approximate date of rejection were
          used in assessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of rejection with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. The total cumulative dose of prednisone was not
          available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNOS</ENAMEX> tracks the numbers of days
          of prednisone administered prior to initial hospital
          discharge; however, values were missing for ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in both databases and could not be used as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariate</ENAMEX> in the above analyses. Maintenance
          immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use, in particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> and tacrolimus, at the time of discharge
          after transplantation was also analyzed as a preexisting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariate</ENAMEX>. Information on use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (other than
          immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, tobacco, or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiologic</ENAMEX> procedures was not available. Dialysis
          modality was obtained from the file Sdiabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>.RXHIST60. The initial dialysis modality a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 60 days</TIMEX> after presentation to
          end stage <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal disease</ENAMEX> and prior to renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX> was utilized in intention to treat
          fashion.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Survival Times</ENAMEX>
          For time to diabetic ketoacidosis, survival time was
          defined as the time from <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> renal transplant until
          hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>, with patients
          censored at death, loss to follow-up, or end of the
          study. Since the most recent hospitalization date was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December, 1999</TIMEX>, this was considered the end of the study
          period for this measurement. Survival time was defined as
          the time from the date of transplant until the date of
          death, censored for loss to follow-up or the end of the
          study. The end of the study period was considered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> for this measurement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> survival
          probabilities were estimated by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Tables</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan Meier</ENAMEX> method.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          All analyses were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>). Files were merged and converted to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> files using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBMS/Copy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conceptual Software</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>). Univariate analysis was performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX>
          testing for categorical variables (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test
          was used for violations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cochran</ENAMEX>'s assumptions) and
          Student's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided t-test for continuous variables (the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> signed rank test was used for variables without
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> regression analysis was
          used to assess trends over time, with adjusted residuals
          inspected to verify the appropriateness of the regression
          technique. Variables with p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.10</NUMEX> in univariate
          analysis for a relationship with development of
          hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> were entered
          into multivariate analysis as covariates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX>
          analysis was used to construct survival plots of time to
          hospitalized diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> after renal transplantation.
          Log-log plots were inspected to assess for
          proportionality of hazards over time at the mean of each
          significant covariate. Because the majority of patients
          were censored (did not experience the primary outcome)
          during the study period, stepwise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox Regression</ENAMEX>
          (likelihood ratio method) was used to model factors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with time to hospitalized diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX>,
          controlling for covariates listed above. For all risk
          factor analysis reported in the present study, only the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> or
          hyperglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX>, respectively,
          occurring during the study period was analyzed (one
          hospitalization per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          hospitalized diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> was assessed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
          non-proportional hazards regression, with times after
          hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis coded as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> and
          all other times as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, as previously reported. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          Tacrolimus was introduced into clinical practice more
          recently than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX>. This could have resulted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> due to the shorter potential follow-up for patients
          taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX>, leading to unequal counting of more
          recent hospitalizations for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who used tacrolimus. In addition, since the rate
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> may have changed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more recent years</TIMEX> of the
          study, temporal bias could have arisen despite adjustment
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of transplant. Therefore, additional analysis
          was performed limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were transplanted
          on or after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 January, 1996</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,096</NUMEX> solitary renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Renal Data System</ENAMEX> transplanted from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1994 to 30 June 1998</TIMEX>, of whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,628</NUMEX> had data complete
        enough to calculate survival times. The most recent
        hospitalization date was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 1999</TIMEX>. The most recent
        date of death was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2000</TIMEX>. Mean follow-up was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.89</NUMEX> Â±
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.15 years</TIMEX> (median, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.91 years</TIMEX>). Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">428</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>
        were hospitalized with a primary discharge diagnosis of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> were hospitalized with a primary discharge
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX>
        total hospitalizations. The most common secondary discharge
        diagnosis for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> and hyperglycemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> was kidney replaced by transplant,
        and secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diagnoses</ENAMEX> did not reveal a preponderance of
        conditions suggesting an underlying condition leading to
        hospitalization. Rates of diabetic ketoacidosis by history
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> at the time of listing are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        Characteristics of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, as well as risk

        noteworthy temporal trends during the time of the study,
        although none were statistically significant. As shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, there was an increase in the rate of both all

        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Regression</ENAMEX> analysis, factors that were positively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with total rates of hospitalized diabetic
        ketoacidosis were younger age, graft loss, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>, more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent year</TIMEX> of transplant, lower body mass
        index, and female gender. There were no significant
        interactions between race, gender, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C status, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tacrolimus</ENAMEX> use. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">de novo diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>, gender
        and graft loss were not significant, and cadaver <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> was
        significant. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Recipients</ENAMEX> who used maintenance tacrolimus
        (adjusted hazard ratio, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.27</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval,

        ketoacidosis, compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> who used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX>.
        Significance persisted even in analysis limited to patients

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> violated the proportional hazards assumption, since
        there was a substantially greater risk of de novo diabetic
        ketoacidosis among tacrolimus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> starting at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
        after transplant, coinciding with the introduction of

        mortality after hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis
        was fairly constant over time. Hospitalized diabetic
        ketoacidosis was independently associated with increased

        analysis, adjusted hazard ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.44</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.10</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.85</NUMEX>,

        Similar to the linear risk of mortality after diabetic

        Discussion
        The present study showed that renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> had a rate of diabetic ketoacidosis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.2/1000</NUMEX>
        person <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recipients</ENAMEX> a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> as a
        comorbid condition and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9/1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> years in patients
        without a prior history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (measured as total
        hospitalizations for comparison with other reports). In
        contrast, the estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> incidence of diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> episodes
        per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> diabetic subjects. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] In the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> episodes as a
        primary hospitalization diagnosis was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3/1000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        and the rate of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome
        episodes was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.04/1000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> (rates stratified for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> were not available). [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] Although
        statistical comparison could not be performed due to the
        much higher rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> among renal transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> than in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the rates of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> in renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> appear to be
        substantially higher than for either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic patients</ENAMEX> or
        for the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, after excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        combined kidney-pancreas transplants.
        Certain risk factors were common to both the total risk
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> and the risk of de novo diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> (diabetic ketoacidosis occurring in patients
        without a prior known history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>). Consistent with
        the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> were at higher
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> than non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> was only introduced into the database
        recently). [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] The higher risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> was independent of other factors in the database,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, graft loss, rejection episodes or
        employment status. Despite adjustment for these factors,
        socioeconomic factors could certainly not be excluded, and
        have been implicated in prior studies. Similarly, low body
        mass index was associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> in
        either situation (in contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body mass</ENAMEX> with the increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II diabetes</ENAMEX>). [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] However, differences in gender and graft loss were not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">de novo diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>. Each of
        these may reflect risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> type and use of maintenance
        tacrolimus were only associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">de novo diabetic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>. The increased risk of cadaver donor type
        could be related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use. The relatively high
        rate of "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">de novo" diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> (diabetic
        ketoacidosis occurring in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not have a known
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> at the time of transplant) could
        represent drug-associated diabetic ketoacidosis, which has
        infrequently been reported with the use of both tacrolimus
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] Previous case series did not have
        sufficient sample size to determine competing risks between
        calcineurin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, but the present study would suggest
        the risk is greater with tacrolimus. Because of rapid
        changes in the use of tacrolimus during the study period,
        as indicated above, conclusions should be limited. We would
        certainly caution any interpretation of tacrolimus use
        since there were substantial temporal trends during the
        study, and tacrolimus was not approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> for use
        in kidney transplantation until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. As indicated, in our
        analysis limited to that time span, tacrolimus was not
        significantly associated with increased risk of diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>.
        Almost all reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">post-transplant diabetes</ENAMEX> mellitus
        in the medical literature have either concerned type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> or have not specified by type. Therefore, reported
        risk factors such as obesity, cumulative prednisone use,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C status would not be expected to affect the
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>, consistent with reports in
        the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This is in contrast to
        hyperglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX>, which would be
        expected to occur disproportionately in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II diabetes</ENAMEX>. While older age and higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> were
        significant in univariate analysis, they were not
        significant in multivariate analysis, while the
        significance of positive recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C serology
        persisted. Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> as an aggregate outcome,
        combining either both type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II diabetes</ENAMEX>, or
        combining diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX>, might obscure the relationship with
        certain risk factors if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were in different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX> (as is the case with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, for
        example: low body mass index being associated with type I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass being associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>). Use of such aggregate outcomes might also have
        missed an association between hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C. The present study thus provides
        more indirect evidence that the post-transplant diabetes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis C</ENAMEX> infection is predominantly type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II diabetes</ENAMEX>, as suggested in other reports. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] This
        is in contrast to a lack of association between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seropositivity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> as a cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX>, as
        we have previously reported. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        Nevertheless, the increasing rate of diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> noted during the study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, more
        marked for total diabetic ketoacidosis than de novo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> ketoacidosis) is in contrast to the decreasing
        rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">de novo diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> and stable rate of
        total diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> noted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of tacrolimus
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). While this information is necessarily
        preliminary, it suggests the possibility that factors other
        than tacrolimus use may be responsible for the increasing
        rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> noted during the study, which
        was independent of all other factors assessed. We did not
        find an association between diabetic ketoacidosis and viral
        infections other than <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytomegalovirus</ENAMEX>,
        nor did we find an association between diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> induction therapy, which would be
        expected to decrease immunity but might also allow for a
        greater propensity to viral infections. We can only point
        to another recent report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhalla et al</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] which
        found that "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">de novo</ENAMEX>" post-transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> mellitus
        (confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal biopsy</ENAMEX>) was much more common and much
        more rapid in onset than previously suspected, and could
        not be explained by usual clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">predictors</ENAMEX>, which is
        quite similar to our findings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> implicated
        "novel mechanisms" as the reason for this rapid increase.
        Whether this represents a relationship with newly
        appreciated viral infections, such as polyomavirus, or
        other factors is presently unknown.
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> and hyperglycemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> were associated with an increased
        risk of mortality among renal transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>,
        consistent with reports in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX>
        ] If anything, the relative risk associated with diabetic
        ketoacidosis was greater than that for hyperglycemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX>, somewhat in contrast to the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. However, previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> based reports have
        not adjusted for the difference in age of presentation for
        this differing conditions. Given the limitations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, causes of death were primarily cardiovascular and
        not infectious, also consistent with the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        There are several limitations to this retrospective
        study. Findings are associative, not causative, and risk
        cannot be assigned without the ability to control for other
        variables prospectively during the course of the study. We
        could not assess the causes for hospitalization for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, or how they were treated, including the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>. This study could not independently verify the type
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. We could not assess certain important risk
        factors, such as nutritional status, the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or
        infection, with hospitalized diabetic ketoacidosis or
        hyperglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICD-9</ENAMEX> coding
        for determining rates of medical conditions has been used
        in other published studies, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] as well as the National
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Health Statistics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cdc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/nchsThe</ENAMEX>
        current study's limitation to hospitalized cases of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> would tend to underestimate the frequency of these
        conditions in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. However, these conditions
        are almost universally managed by hospitalization in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. Another limitation of the study is the
        inability to track whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were subsequently
        switched from tacrolimus or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> during the course
        of the present study. However, reports of conversion from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> to tacrolimus, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] which are most
        commonly employed as a rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for refractory acute or
        chronic rejection or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> toxicity, suggest that
        this number is very small. Similarly, conversion from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tacrolimus</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX>, most commonly due to tacrolimus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">induced diabetes</ENAMEX>, by published report appears to be even
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rarer</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] The short followup duration of the study may
        also be a limitation. Strengths of the present analysis
        include its large size and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, and
        relatively complete capture and followup.
        In conclusion, rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> and
        hyperglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> after renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX> were substantially higher than reported for
        the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, whether in diabetic or non-diabetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. These rates appear to be increasing
        significantly over time, particularly for diabetic
        ketoacidosis, even as the risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with tacrolimus is decreasing
        significantly. In addition, we identified high-risk groups
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX>, de novo diabetic ketoacidosis
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome</ENAMEX> after renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>, and confirmed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
        syndrome with increased mortality after renal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transplantation</ENAMEX>.
