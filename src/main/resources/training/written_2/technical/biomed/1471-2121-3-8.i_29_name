        Transforming growth factor beta (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF-Î²</ENAMEX>) family proteins
        are multifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokines</ENAMEX> capable of regulating cell
        growth, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, and immune
        cell functions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyaluronidase</ENAMEX> is an extracellular

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . Previously we have shown that bovine testicular
        hyaluronidase, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX>, increases the
        susceptibility of various cancer cells to tumor necrosis
        factor (TNF or TNF-Î±) cytotoxicity [ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , review]. PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        induces the expression of proapoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and WOX1
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WW</ENAMEX> domain-containing oxidoreductase; also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWOX</ENAMEX> or
        FOR) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , which contributes to the increased TNF

        with the enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TGF-Î²</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX>,<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²2 and Î²3</NUMEX>, induce
        TNF-resistance and suppress the PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> effect of increasing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity in murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L929 fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 11</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> induces a novel extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix protein</ENAMEX> that
        prevents TNF-mediated cell death and blocks the activation

        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p42/44</NUMEX> mitogen-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p42/44</NUMEX> MAPK) in
        L929 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12</ENAMEX> ] . Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> induces the
        expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TIAF1</TIMEX> (TGF-Î²-induced antiapoptotic factor) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TIF2</TIMEX> (TGF-Î²-induced factor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] that inhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity. Whether these TGF-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced proteins
        restrict the ability of PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity
        is unknown.
        PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> blocks <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-mediated growth suppression of
        epithelial cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 15</ENAMEX> ] . Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX> rapidly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activates ERK</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> reduces the

        synergistically increases PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-mediated inhibition of
        staurosporine apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">physiological</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> for only certain cellular
        responses.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyaluronidases</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> play a critical role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> invasion and metastasis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , although
        inactivation of 
        HYAL1 gene has been shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and
        neck squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinomas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, also known
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Luca-1</ENAMEX>, is a lysosomal enzyme that is secreted from
        cells. Hyal-1 is a candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 18</ENAMEX> ] ,
        although it enhances extravasation and metastasis of
        prostate cancer cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Also, mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyal</ENAMEX>-1 may
        contribute to the pathogenesis of a lysosomal disorder,
        mucopolysaccharidosis <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Hyal-2 is a lysosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is active at low pH [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
        also known to be a glycosylphosphatidylinositol

        Testicular hyaluronidase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX> counteracts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced TNF-resistance in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The
        goal of the present study was to examine whether lysosomal
        Hyal-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxic function and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counteract TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-mediated</NUMEX> TNF-resistance in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells. It
        was determined that stable expression of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> in
        L929 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> increased their sensitivity to TNF-mediated
        death, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> was somewhat less effective. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>
        blocked this increased sensitivity. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> did not enhance L929 cell death by anticancer drugs
        such as daunorubicin, actinomycin D, staurosporine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camptothecin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overexpressed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> induced the
        expression of proapoptotic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WOX1</TIMEX>, but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, suggesting a
        role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WOX1</ENAMEX> in the increased cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity. Additional mechanisms that are associated
        with the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity were also
        investigated.
      
      
        Results
        As summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX> induces the expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proapoptotic p53</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WOX1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] and downregulates
        antiapoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix inter-Î±-inhibitor</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , thereby
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancing TNF</ENAMEX> susceptibility in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells. Also, PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        rapidly activates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> and c-Jun

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . Whether these signaling events lead to induction of
        p53 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WOX1</ENAMEX> is unknown.
        In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> protects L929 cells from TNF
        cytotoxicity by upregulating the expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiapoptotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIAF1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIF2</ENAMEX> and a novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> blocks PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-increased TNF

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced TNF-resistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> suppresses

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> is not related with PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-increased TNF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Whether the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiapoptotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIAF1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIF2</ENAMEX> is not known. In this study,
        experiments were designed to determine whether lysosomal
        Hyal-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxic function and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counteract TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-mediated</NUMEX> TNF-resistance in L929
        cells.
        The full-length murine hyaluronidase 
        Hyal1 and 
        Hyal2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNAs</ENAMEX> were found in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AA688635 and BF139787</TIMEX>,
        respectively) and the determined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> have been
        deposited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> ( 
        Hyal1 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF422176</TIMEX>; 
        Hyal2 , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF422177</TIMEX>). The 
        Hyal1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">463</NUMEX>-amino-acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.1%</NUMEX> identity to a reported murine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF011567</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Differences in the protein
        sequences are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gly-247</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gly-284</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cys-450</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hyal</ENAMEX>-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg-247</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu-284</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Arg-450</ENAMEX> in
        AF011567. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transitions</ENAMEX> in these amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> are
        non-conservative.
        The murine 
        Hyal2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF422177</NUMEX>) encodes a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">473</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid protein</ENAMEX>. The deduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> is
        identical to a reported murine sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF302844</NUMEX>), but has
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ile-355</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Val-355</ENAMEX> transition compared to another clone
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF302843</NUMEX>). Variation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> is also found
        in a murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homologue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">034619</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , which
        possesses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> unique <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-, 5-</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> segments,
        not identical to the above <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        L929 cells were engineered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stably</ENAMEX> express GFP-Hyal-1
        or GFP-Hyal-2 fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The presence of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was demonstrated in Western
        blotting using anti-GFP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        Exogenous bovine testicular hyaluronidase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX> stimulates
        rapid activation of c-Jun 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -terminal kinases (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JNK1 and JNK2</TIMEX>)
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, the stably expressed
        Hyal-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> could not mediate constitutive activation
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">JNK1 and JNK2</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells (data not shown).
        Exposure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2-expressing L929</ENAMEX> cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hr</ENAMEX> resulted in increased cell death by ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60-110%</NUMEX>,
        compared to the control GFP-expressing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        These results are similar to the bovine testicular
        PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">L929 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In
        contrast, there were no significant differences in the
        extent of cell death when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> and control
        GFP-expressing cells were exposed to staurosporine,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">actinomycin</TIMEX> D, daunorubicin, or camptothecin for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-24</NUMEX> hr
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        There was also an increased susceptibility to TNF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1-expressing L929</ENAMEX> cells
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20-90%</NUMEX> increase; also see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), compared
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> control cells. However, there were no
        significant differences among these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the extent of
        death caused by staurosporine, actinomycin D, daunorubicin
        and camptothecin (data not shown).
        In similar experiments, the effect of transient
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> on cellular sensitivity to
        anticancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> was examined. L929 cells were
        electroporated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> construct,
        cultured for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hr and then exposed to actinomycin D,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daunorubicin</ENAMEX> or camptothecin for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hr.</TIMEX> There were no
        differences in cell death in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and
        Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-expressing cells, compared to control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (data
        not shown). These findings are consistent with the results
        for stable transfectants presented above (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Bovine testicular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX> enhances TNF sensitivity in L929
        cells by increasing the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proapoptotic p53</ENAMEX> and
        WOX1 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . The ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> to induce
        the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53 and WOX1</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells was examined.
        L929 cells were electroporated with nothing (null), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> and cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hr.</TIMEX>
        Transient expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> in L929
        cells induced WOX1 expression, whereas no WOX1 expression
        was observed in non-transfected cells or control
        GFP-expressing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length WOX1</ENAMEX>, while the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> is a degraded WOX1
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . No detectable p53 expression was observed in these
        cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A).
        In comparison, the cytosolic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WOX1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46 kDa</NUMEX>) was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> expressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L929</TIMEX> cells stably
        transfected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> construct, while TNF
        reduced WOX1 expression in a time-dependent manner (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        3B). This reduction is probably due to TNF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mediated</NUMEX> WOX1
        nuclear translocation from the mitochondria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In
        contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WOX1</TIMEX> was not expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells stably
        transfected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-1</ENAMEX> construct, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> induced
        WOX1 expression in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 min</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> did not induce
        WOX1 expression in the control GFP-expressing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        3B).
        Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> enhances the apoptosis-inducing function
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">WOX1</ENAMEX> was determined. In transient transfection
        experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells were electroporated with GFP-Hyal-2
        and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WOX1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> enhanced WOX1-mediated
        L929 cell death, as determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> hr post-transfection
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">violet staining</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). In contrast,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-1</ENAMEX> did not enhance WOX1-mediated cell death (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        3C). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> alone did not mediate cell
        death (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C).
        Next, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-mediated IÎ</ENAMEX>ºBÎ± degradation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX> was examined in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-1 and Hyal</ENAMEX>-2
        cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> stable transfectants
        and control cells were exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> for various times.
        IÎºBÎ± degradation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translocation</ENAMEX>) were observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 to 60</NUMEX> min in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyal</ENAMEX>-2
        cells post TNF stimulation, but at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 20 min time</TIMEX> point in
        both control and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyal</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        To further understand how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hyal</ENAMEX>-2 participates in the
        apoptosis pathway, the translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> to the
        mitochondria was examined during cell death. Transient
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COS7</TIMEX> fibroblasts showed the
        localization of the expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the lysosome but
        not in the mitochondria, as determined by staining the
        cells using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LysoTracker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitotracker Red</ENAMEX> (data not
        shown). These observations are consistent with other
        reports [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 20</ENAMEX> ] . COS7 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are TNF-resistant. The
        reasons for using this cell type are its large size (which
        provides better resolution under fluorescence microscopy)
        and the ease of transfection and gene expression using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">liposome</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reagents</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FuGene 6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneFector</ENAMEX>.
        Exposure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2-expressing COS7</ENAMEX> cells to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staurosporine</ENAMEX> (for inducing apoptosis) resulted in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-related increase in co-localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> with
        the mitochondria (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), suggesting that a portion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Hyal-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">migrates</ENAMEX> to the mitochondria during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
        Next, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> antagonizes the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyal</ENAMEX>-1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> in growth regulation was examined. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>
        inhibits epithelial cell growth but promotes fibroblast
        growth [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> inhibition of epithelial cell growth
        is blocked by bovine testicular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PH-20</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In agreement
        with our previous observations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> promoted
        L929 cell growth by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-48 hr</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> did not promote the growth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells
        stably expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        Finally, the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonism</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> and
        Hyal-1 or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> in regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF</ENAMEX> susceptibility in L929
        cells was examined. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> stable
        transfectants were pretreated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr and then
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyal</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>- and
        Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity were suppressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-50%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> blocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity
        of the GFP-expressing control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to a greater extent
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-70%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, the novel function of the lysosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyaluronidases</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> in increasing cellular
        sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity is reported. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">counteracted Hyal-1- and Hyal-2-</ENAMEX>increased TNF killing of
        L929 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> increased L929 growth, while
        Hyal-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> blocked this enhancement of cell growth.
        These observations are consistent with our previous finding
        that exogenous bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhances TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity in various cancer cells, and that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> blocks the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 15</ENAMEX> ] . As
        summarized in the Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, the underlying mechanisms
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">whereby Hyal-2</ENAMEX> induces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> appear to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> induction of the proapoptotic
        WOX1, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Hyal-2 migration to the mitochondria during
        apoptosis, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the prolonged period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºBÎ± degradation
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> activation in TNF-treated Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-expressing
        cells.
        Upregulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53 and WOX1</TIMEX> contributes, in part, to
        the PH-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-enhanced cytotoxic function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 23</ENAMEX> ] .
        WOX1 is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Ectopic expression of both
        p53 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WOX1</ENAMEX> cDNA constructs results in colocalization of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the mitochondria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> and complex formation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between p53 and WOX1</TIMEX> in the
        cytoplasm are observed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apoptosis</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Both p53
        and WOX1 mediate apoptosis synergistically. Overexpressed
        WOX1 alone mediates apoptosis independently of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> apoptosis requires the participation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">WOX1</TIMEX>.
        Blocking WOX1 expression with antisense mRNA abolishes
        p53-mediated cell death, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WOX1</ENAMEX> is a
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> in apoptosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 23</NUMEX> ] .
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2 induced WOX1</ENAMEX> expression when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells. However, only Hyal-2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">induced WOX1</ENAMEX> expression following stable transfection of
        L929 cells. This correlates with the greater extent of
        Hyal-2 enhancement of TNF killing compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX>. WOX1
        expression was induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> stable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfectant</ENAMEX>. In transient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transfection</ENAMEX> experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyal</ENAMEX>-2
        enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">WOX1-mediated L929</ENAMEX> cell death, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> had no
        effect. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> alone failed to induce cell
        death. Thus, induction of WOX1 expression contributes, in
        part, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1- and Hyal-2-</ENAMEX>increased TNF sensitivity in
        L929 cells.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TNF</ENAMEX> rapidly induces phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎºBÎ±</ENAMEX>, which
        normally peaks at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-10 min</TIMEX>, followed by
        proteasome-dependent degradation (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-20 min</TIMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 24</NUMEX> ] .
        IÎºBÎ± degradation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> activation occurred, as
        determined <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> after exposure of control and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyal</ENAMEX>-1
        cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>. However, there was an extended period of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-mediated IÎ</ENAMEX>ºBÎ± degradation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> activation in
        Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-60</NUMEX> min. It is unclear whether
        this extend ed period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºBÎ± degradation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> directly contributes to the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> to
        enhance TNF-mediated apoptosis. IÎºBÎ± is a physiological
        inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX>; IÎºBÎ± <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-ÎºB
        and prevents its translocation to the nucleus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 24</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB activation</ENAMEX> is believed to induce antiapoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to block cell death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, in several
        studies activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> cannot protect cells from apoptosis
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> appears to be essential in the
        p53-mediated apoptosis in tested cell lines [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        The mitochondrion is a reservoir of proapoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and plays a key role in apoptosis [ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] ;
        reviews]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the pathways that leads to the release of
        proapoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the mitochondria has been
        determined. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF/TNF</ENAMEX> receptor-signaling
        complex activates caspase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, which leads to the activation
        and cleavage of Bid, a proapoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bcl</ENAMEX>-2
        family. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Activated or truncated Bid</ENAMEX> (tBid) in turn activates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bax</ENAMEX>. Bak migrates to the mitochondrial outer
        membrane where it generates transmembrane pores; Bax
        induces the opening of the mitochondrial permeability
        transition pores. Cytochrome c is then released from the
        mitochondria into the cytosol, where it interacts with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">downstream proapoptotic proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Apaf-1</ENAMEX> and caspase
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Activation of these proteins further activates
        nucleases, such as caspase-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNase</ENAMEX> (CAD), which
        cause DNA fragmentation.
        During staurosporine-mediated apoptosis, a portion of
        the lysosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">migrates</ENAMEX> to the mitochondria. Whether
        Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mitochondrial</ENAMEX> membrane damage is unknown.
        Presumably, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> interacts with a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> target
        on the mitochondrial surface that changes the membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeability</ENAMEX>. This notion is supported by our recent
        screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid interactions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> , unpublished)
        The functional property of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> in degrading
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hyaluronic acid</ENAMEX> is controversial. Hyal-2 is found in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysosome</ENAMEX> and is active under conditions of low pH [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Hyal-2 is also found on the cell surface as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</ENAMEX> (GPI)-anchored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for
        jaagsiekte <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep retrovirus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Nonetheless, the
        enzymatic activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> has not been detected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Whether the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells caused
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> is associated with their enzymatic
        activities is being studied in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> effects could
        be abolished by cycloheximide or actinomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> (data not
        shown). That is, inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> or gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> reduced the inhibitory effect of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> in
        the prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1-</ENAMEX> or Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-increased TNF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>. Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-induced antiapoptotic proteins
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIAF1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIF2</ENAMEX> inhibit the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyal-2</ENAMEX> remains to be determined.
      
      
        Conclusions

        suppressed the induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> sensitivity. Furthermore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1-mediated L929</ENAMEX> cell proliferation was blocked by
        Hyal-1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-2</ENAMEX>. These data indicate that there is a
        functional antagonism between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hyal-1</ENAMEX> or Hyal-2.
        Hyal-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> susceptibility in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L929</NUMEX> cells appears
