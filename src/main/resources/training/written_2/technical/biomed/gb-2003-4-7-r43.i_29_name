        All organisms have evolved intricate signaling networks
        that sense and respond to their environment. At a cellular
        level, the activation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more signaling networks
        often leads to coordinated changes in gene expression, via
        the regulated activity and binding of transcription factors
        to transcription control regions (TCRs) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (for
        example, enhancers and upstream activating sequences). In
        yeast and most other eukaryotes, the transcriptional
        regulation of individual genes is often multifactorial, as
        multiple transcription factors may bind to a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . Multifactorial regulation encompasses several
        distinct biochemical mechanisms. In some cases,
        transcription factors may bind cooperatively to adjacent
        DNA sites via direct physical interaction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . In
        other cases, multiple transcription factors that bind
        independently may recruit a common co-activator [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , or
        may act independently of one another to alter gene
        expression in response to distinct cellular cues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Recent studies have also suggested that nearby
        transcription factors may collaboratively compete with
        nucleosomes, thus enhancing the binding of individual
        transcription factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . Many experiments in yeast
        have shown that specific pairs of factors must be bound
        near each other for multifactorial regulation to occur [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] , and it is on these spatial constraints that we
        focus here.
        The challenges in understanding how regulatory
        information is encoded in genomes include both the
        identification of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> and the
        elucidation of sequence constraints on productive
        multifactorial regulation. Previous computational work has
        been devoted to identifying putative binding sites for
        transcription factors. A plethora of computational methods
        has been developed to find over-represented sequences in a
        subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> believed to contain a common transcription
        factor binding site (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ). The rapid pace
        of genome sequencing has enabled a complementary approach -
        phylogenetic footprinting (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] ) - which
        recognizes that the conservation of sequences across
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> often reflects evolutionary selection for
        their presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithms</ENAMEX> have been
        developed to perform systematic phylogenetic footprinting
        analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        After compiling a collection of putative binding sites,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> can be made between various binding site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assortments</ENAMEX> and gene expression. Some recent approaches
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> logic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , regression methods [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] , spatial clustering [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and multiple binding
        site matrix classifiers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spatial</ENAMEX> information
        on the relative locations of binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is ignored in
        all but the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of approaches.
        The primary aim of this work was to incorporate
        positional information and phylogenetic footprinting in
        methods of identifying sequence motifs that may regulate
        gene expression. Consequently, we expanded the focus of
        phylogenetic footprinting from the conservation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contiguous</ENAMEX> sequences to higher-order features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>,
        namely the spatial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of individual binding
        sites. Because transcription factors participating in
        multifactorial regulation may require binding sites in
        physical proximity to each other, we searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        conserved sequences that were more closely spaced in TCRs
        than expected. We refer to these spatially organized
        sequences as conserved 'word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">templates</ENAMEX>'. As a proof of
        principle, we started with the simplest example of such
        templates: pairs of conserved words of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> base-pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX> was assessed using the genome sequences of 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae and three
        closely related 
        Saccharomyces <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, which had been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> to identify conserved regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        . To exploit this comparative genomic data, we have devised
        a method that systematically tested sequence pairs for
        joint conservation across genomes and close spacing within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual TCRs</ENAMEX>. As genes regulated by the same set of
        transcription factors often display similar gene-expression
        patterns in certain experimental conditions, we identified
        pairs of conserved word templates whose gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with common changes in gene expression. We
        adopted a group-by-sequence approach to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> identify
        genes that contained the word-pair templates and then to
        test for significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with expression levels of
        the identified genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Significant associations
        between conserved word-pair templates and specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes and the prevalence of known
        transcription factor binding sites suggest that conserved
        word-pair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">templates</ENAMEX> comprise sequences important for
        multifactorial regulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. In addition, conserved
        word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair templates</ENAMEX> represent more specific predictors of
        gene expression than individual words or word pairs in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae .

          Identification of conserved word-pair
          templates
          Multiple genome sequences provide additional power to
          studies of gene regulation. Because of natural selection,
          mutations accumulate more rapidly in non-functional DNA
          regions than in functionally constrained bases. Given a
          multiple sequence alignment of orthologous sequences from
          closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, the aligned and invariant
          regions should be enriched for functionally important
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Additional 
          Saccharomyces genomes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> to ensure sufficient sequence similarity to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae such that orthologous
          regions could be reliably aligned, yet enough sequence
          divergence that functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> would be much more
          conserved than nonfunctional sequences [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 28</NUMEX> ] . To
          confirm that regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were found in conserved
          regions, we tested a database of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> known, nonredundant
          regulatory motifs and found that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35</TIMEX> show conservation
          ratios that were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> standard deviations
          above that expected by chance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 29</NUMEX> ] .
          We present a method to find conserved higher-order
          sequence templates from related 
          Saccharomyces genomes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Our method incorporates sequential statistical tests,
          with each step focusing on a distinct property of
          conserved sequence templates. The simplest instances of
          sequence templates involve word pairs and their relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spacing</ENAMEX>. As described in detail below, pairs of words
          that were conserved in the same intergenic regions of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> 
          Saccharomyces genomes were
          identified using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test for independence.
          Next, a permutation test was used to select word pairs
          whose physical proximity was closer than that expected by
          chance. Finally, to evaluate the transcriptional
          information contained in conserved word pairs with close
          spacing, the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> templates
          was compared to the rest of the genome. We initialized
          our word list using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 2,080</NUMEX> words of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, treating
          a given word and its reverse complement as identical. For
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> (consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 600 bp</NUMEX> upstream of an open
          reading frame), a word was labeled conserved if all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          bases were identical in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> 
          Saccharomyces genomes, on the basis
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> alignment of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>.
          To test systematically whether words were conserved
          more often in the same intergenic regions of the 
          Saccharomyces genomes than expected
          by independent conservation, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test was
          performed on all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pairwise</ENAMEX> combinations of words
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Pairs of words that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlapped</ENAMEX> each other by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> were
          excluded. A significant proportion of word pairs showed
          dependent conservation: among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.16 million</NUMEX> word pairs
          tested, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,452</NUMEX> of them (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 0.4%</NUMEX>) had
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation χ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2scores</ENAMEX> greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31.1</NUMEX>. This threshold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a probability of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> for obtaining one or
          more false positives after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction for
          multiple testing.
          Next, we selected word pairs that displayed closer
          physical spacing in intergenic regions than expected by
          chance. The choice of a statistical test to evaluate
          close distances must consider the local fluctuations of
          A+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleotide</ENAMEX> content in genome sequences. Previous work
          used a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poisson</ENAMEX> distribution to evaluate proximity between
          binding sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . However, variability in base
          composition can skew occurrences of arbitrary sequences
          away from their expected distributions. Indeed, this
          statistical test was confounded by large fluctuations in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> parameter estimates, which varied up to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> within a single chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          The effects of base-composition fluctuations, as well
          as varying lengths of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>, motivated our nonparametric
          statistical test for close spacing. We used the median,
          denoted by , to summarize a distribution of minimum
          distances between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae . This distribution
          was calculated on the basis of the genes whose TCRs
          conserved both words, and is independent of the relative
          word order. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nonoverlapping words were closely
          spaced in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>, we should find to be smaller than
          expected by chance. The statistical significance of this
          spacing was assessed using a permutation test by
          selecting the set of genes that contained a conserved
          word <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> and then randomizing the assignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
          the words to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing that word (see
          Materials and methods). By permuting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> labels for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the words, but not the word positions themselves,
          we retained the positional biases of individual words
          within intergenic regions.
          After correcting for multiple testing by controlling
          the false discovery rate (FDR), a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">989</NUMEX> out of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,452</NUMEX> word pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 12%</NUMEX>) had significantly small
          values (FDR 
          q <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) for (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For a
          list of these closely spaced and jointly conserved word
          pairs see Additional data files. As a negative control,
          we also assayed a sample of word pairs that did not show
          dependent conservation (conservation <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">χ 2< 1</NUMEX>), yet were
          jointly conserved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>. No word pairs in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,718</NUMEX> pairs with nondependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">conservation (χ 2< 1</ENAMEX>) showed significantly small
          values for , after correction for multiple testing.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2illustrates</NUMEX> the distributions of for conserved
          word-pair templates, jointly conserved word pairs, and
          randomly conserved word pairs. The medians of these
          distance distributions were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> nucleotides, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> nucleotides, respectively. Notably,
          the median for template pairs was significantly smaller (
          
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) than the median for
          randomly conserved pairs. These results indicate that
          many of the word pairs that were conserved in the same
          intergenic regions of multiple 
          Saccharomyces genomes also
          exhibited closer spacing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Conserved word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair templates</ENAMEX> were significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with gene expression
          Our method identified conserved word-pair templates
          that were statistically significant with respect to both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-conservation in multiple genomes and close spacing in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae TCRs</ENAMEX>. To evaluate the
          regulatory information in these templates, we assessed
          the statistical association between gene groups that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> a template and changes in gene expression.
          Similarly to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-by-sequence approaches for
          finding regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, we expect that gene subsets
          defined by common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> sequence features should have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns that are similar under
          conditions where the transcription factors are active,
          yet are different from the average expression of genes in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          To assess the association between conserved word-pair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">templates</ENAMEX> and differentially expressed genes, we
          identified gene subsets whose TCRs contained both
          conserved words in the template and observed their
          expression patterns in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae in</ENAMEX> publicly available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX> ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] , see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods for details). We then conducted
          Kolmogorov-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smirnov</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX>) tests to evaluate for
          differential gene expression between each gene subset and
          the whole genome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> tests provide a nonparametric,
          sensitive and robust way to compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distributions.
          Similar results were obtained using other statistical
          tests, such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests and likelihood ratio tests
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.M. Moses</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> × 
          C matrix was computed: each
          conserved word pair in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> was assigned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value for each experimental
          condition observed in 
          C (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
          Entries in this matrix (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values) were filtered out if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value: did not meet the
          threshold for multiple testing or was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> times
          more significant than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value for a gene subset
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with either word alone (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods). The latter criterion minimizes gene-expression
          changes that can be explained by the presence of a single
          conserved word.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3ashows</NUMEX> the number of conserved word-pair
          templates that were significantly associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes, for varying significance levels
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> test, which have been corrected for multiple
          testing (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> indicates
          the number of gene subsets that were significant in a
          different minimum number of experimental conditions.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several hundred</NUMEX> closely spaced word pairs were
          significantly associated with differential gene
          expression. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">314</ENAMEX> word pairs met an
          FDR-corrected significance threshold of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 10</ENAMEX> -3for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more
          experimental conditions, which represented approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> of all closely spaced word pairs.
          The proportion of conserved word-pair templates
          showing significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with gene expression was
          compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of negative controls, comprising
          word pairs that failed either the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (co-conservation)
          or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close spacing</NUMEX>) statistical test. For the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, we used a sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">624</ENAMEX> word pairs that failed
          the joint conservation test (conservation <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">χ 2< 1</NUMEX>)
          found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>, but also showed modest
          constraints on word pair spacing ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.15</NUMEX>). Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of these
          word pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1.3%</NUMEX>) were significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with gene-expression changes at an
          FDR-corrected threshold of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 10</ENAMEX> -3for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more
          experimental conditions. To assess the relative
          enrichment for significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes at a variety of multiple testing
          thresholds, we computed an odds ratio: the proportion of
          significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> among the template pairs,
          divided by the proportion of significant associations
          among the random pairs. For the above threshold, the odds
          ratio was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 22</NUMEX>. In other words, gene groups that
          contain a common conserved word-pair template in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 22</NUMEX> times more likely to be associated
          with significant gene-expression changes, compared with
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> selected using randomly conserved word pairs.
          As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b</TIMEX>, the odds ratios for association
          with gene expression changes in multiple conditions
          varied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 10 and 35</TIMEX>. This analysis was repeated for
          a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,737</NUMEX> co-conserved (conservation <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">χ 2</NUMEX>>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31.1</NUMEX>) word pairs that failed the close spacing test
          (permutation 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> after multiple
          testing), yet occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> intergenic regions.
          The relative enrichment for gene expression associations
          in closely spaced words is displayed in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3c</TIMEX>. Among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-conserved word pairs, those pairs that were closely
          spaced than expected were still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2 to 12</NUMEX> times more
          likely to be significantly associated with gene
          expression changes, compared to word pairs that were not
          found to have significantly close spacing. We confirmed
          that gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> associated with significant gene
          expression changes did not have statistically significant
          differences in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> sizes, as assessed by a
          permutation test (data not shown). Thus, gene groups that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contained</ENAMEX> co-conserved and spatially close word pairs are
          more significantly associated with gene-expression
          changes than expected by chance.
        
        
          Many identified sequences represented known
          transcription factor binding sites
          In addition to their statistical significance, many
          conserved word-pair templates that were most strongly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with gene-expression changes were consistent
          with biological information on the transcription factors
          known to bind those sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . In all analyses
          described below, we used a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">314</ENAMEX> word pairs that had
          significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with gene-expression changes at
          an FDR-corrected multiple testing threshold of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < 10</ENAMEX> -3for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more
          experiments. For visualization purposes, we organized the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> × 
          C matrix by hierarchically
          clustering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">314</ENAMEX> word pairs
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods for details).
          Hierarchical clustering of this output matrix
          identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of word pairs with similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values in specific subsets of
          experimental conditions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). For these clustered
          output matrices, see Additional data files. In many
          cases, the word pairs that clustered together also
          comprised overlapping hexamer sequences, suggesting that
          some of the hexamers in different pairs may represent a
          larger, somewhat variable sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For
          example, group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4included six</NUMEX> word pairs. In
          each of these word pairs, one of the component words -
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCACGT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CACGTG</ENAMEX>, or ACGTGC - matched part of the
          consensus binding site for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cbf1p</TIMEX> (TCACGTG). The other
          component word in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> - such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTGTG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTGTGG</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGTGGC</ENAMEX> or GTGGCT - represented part of the known
          Met31<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> binding site (AAACTGTGG). Therefore, genes
          whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> contained any word pair within this group
          probably contained a conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cbf1p</NUMEX>-binding site, along
          with a conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-binding site, and the
          distances between the conserved sites in these genes were
          also smaller than expected by chance. These results agree
          with the known interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cbf1p</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> for the
          regulation of genes involved in sulfur utilization (see
          Discussion).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> a partial list of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> most significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of consensus sequences, which were assembled by
          joining adjacent word pairs in the clustered output
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> with overlapping sequences. Many of these
          consensus sequences matched transcription factor binding
          sites that had been biochemically verified. Several pairs
          of transcription factors, denoted by stars in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
          were not previously known to act on the same sets of
          target genes.
        
        
          Conditions with significant gene-expression changes
          coincided with transcription factor activity
          Further support that templates contain transcriptional
          regulatory information was obtained from a key
          observation: the experimental conditions with significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes often corresponded to conditions
          in which the cognate transcription factors are known to
          be active (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In addition, many gene subsets that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> an individual word-pair template in their TCRs
          were highly enriched for gene-expression changes. We will
          survey examples of word-pair templates associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes, focusing our attention on
          several environmental stress conditions. The
          environmental stress response represents a paradigm for
          multifactorial control of transcription regulation.
          Genome-wide expression studies found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 300</NUMEX>
          genes were induced and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were repressed in
          response to a wide variety of stressful environmental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 37</NUMEX> ] . Many of these genes also showed
          subtly different expression patterns in response to
          specific stimuli, suggesting that the common
          environmental stress response may be modulated by the
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>-specific transcription factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over a third</NUMEX> of the conserved word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair templates</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with gene-expression changes in multiple
          environmental stress conditions (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4a</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of overlapping word pairs contained
          matches to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRPE</ENAMEX> motifs, which were associated
          with genes that were repressed in multiple stresses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . These motifs were discovered by their enrichment
          among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were commonly
          repressed in stress, yet the putative transcription
          factors that bind these sequences have yet to be
          determined. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of overlapping word
          pairs corresponded to the RRPE core, which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          nucleotides long, along with some flanking conserved
          bases. These repressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were enriched for rRNA
          processing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes in which this motif
          was originally identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> conserved
          word-pair templates contained sequences that matched most
          of the stress response element (STRE), the consensus site
          for the general stress transcription factors <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Msn2p/Msn4p.</ENAMEX>
          Genes that conserved both these words in their TCRs were
          significantly associated with gene-expression induction
          in multiple environmental stresses, including cadmium,
          heat shock, amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> starvation, nitrogen depletion and
          stationary phase. In most cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> comprising
          the word pairs were mutually overlapping. We interpret
          these sequences as representing different <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> of the
          same binding site. Because our test for close spacing
          required non-overlapping sequences, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words must
          have appeared <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 6 bp</NUMEX> away in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>. Thus, these genes
          have probably conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two Msn2/4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-like
          consensus sequences in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>.
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of conserved word-pair templates only
          showed significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with gene expression
          changes in different subsets of stress conditions (Figure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4b, Tables 1, 2</ENAMEX>). For example, binding sites for Cbf1p
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> were found to co-occur in several conserved
          word-pair templates. Genes that contained conserved
          binding sites for these transcription factors in their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> were strongly induced in cadmium, amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starvation</ENAMEX> and early nitrogen depletion. These conditions
          are consistent with the biological activity of these
          transcription factors, which induce transcription of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur-assimilation genes</ENAMEX> in response to the demand of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur-containing metabolites</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 39 40</ENAMEX> ] . In another
          example, several word pairs comprising binding sites for
          the transcriptional repressors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mig1p and Ume6p</TIMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with induced gene expression in stationary
          phase. The observed derepression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mig1p</ENAMEX> and Ume6p
          targets in stationary phase is consistent with the
          nuclear export of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mig1p</NUMEX> repressor under glucose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>, as well as recent findings that carbon source
          genes can be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ume6p</TIMEX> targets [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . In addition, genes
          containing a conserved sequence similar to the consensus
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Msn2/4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>, an inducer of the environmental stress
          response, and the heat-shock transcription factor Hsf1p
          were significantly induced under heat shock. Once again,
          the conditions with most significant gene-expression
          changes corresponded to the known activities of the
          transcription factors involved.
        
        
          Enrichment for known transcription factor targets
          among individual gene groups
          Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes with shared word-pair templates
          were enriched for known targets of transcription factors.
          The vast majority of genes with conserved sites for both
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cbf1p</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> transcription factors were
          induced more than fourfold in cadmium, amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">starvation</ENAMEX> and early nitrogen depletion (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). Half
          of these genes have confirmed roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX>-utilization
          processes, such as methionine metabolism, sulfate
          assimilation, sulfate transport and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur amino acid</ENAMEX>
          metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Compared to the rest of the genome,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes that conserved both of these words
          within their TCRs was highly enriched for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur-utilization genes</ENAMEX> (hypergeometric 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -16</NUMEX>, after
          Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). In addition,
          we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> ( 
          GSH1 , 
          RAD59 and 
          BNA3 ) with highly correlated
          expression under the above conditions, and thus may be
          commonly regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cbf1p</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>, despite their
          lack of direct annotation as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur-utilization genes</ENAMEX>.
          The shared conservation of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cbf1p</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>
          sites provides further evidence that these genes comprise
          part of the cellular response to the demand for products
          of this pathway.
          Genes with a conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site for the Hap1p
          transcription factor, as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">conserved Ecm22p/</ENAMEX>Upc2p
          binding site in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>, were significantly associated
          with induction in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that inhibited
          ergosterol biosynthesis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          genes contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ergosterol biosynthesis genes</ENAMEX>; this
          proportion represented an enrichment compared to the rest
          of the genome (hypergeometric 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 6</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -6after
          Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). The
          transcription factors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ecm22p and Upc2p</TIMEX> have been shown to
          induce the expression of ergosterol biosynthesis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
          response to low intracellular concentrations of
          ergosterol, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hap1p</ENAMEX> is known to regulate the
          expression of these genes according to the availability
          of heme and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, which are required for the pathway [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Conserved word pairs were more informative than
          sequence features derived from single words or single
          species
          The above results from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> test strongly suggested
          that sequence features based on the co-conservation and
          close spacing of word pairs identified examples of
          multifactorial regulation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other statistical tests
          were also performed to examine how information contained
          in conserved word-pair templates compared to other
          sequence features derived from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , or from single
          conserved words. Informative sequence features should be
          both highly specific (a high proportion of genes that
          share the feature should show gene-expression changes)
          and highly sensitive (most of the genes that show
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression changes should also share the
          feature).
          To assess the specificity of a sequence feature in
          explaining gene expression, we computed the average
          expression profile for all genes that shared that
          feature. We expect that if a sequence feature represented
          a transcription factor binding site, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> containing
          that feature in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> would be induced (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repressed</ENAMEX>), on average, compared to all the genes in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . By comparing the average expression
          profile derived from conserved word-pair templates with
          average expression profiles derived from simpler sequence
          features, we assessed how much information was obtained
          by incorporating both the conservation and pairwise
          combination of sequences. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> word pairs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with significant gene-expression changes in
          environmental stress conditions, we compared the average
          expression profile for: gene subsets that shared single
          words in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae ; gene subsets that
          conserved single words among multiple genomes; and gene
          subsets that shared both words in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6and</TIMEX> see
          Additional data files). In general, the average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles for conserved word pairs were
          more significantly different from the average expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the genome when either conservation or word
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> was used as an additional criterion for gene
          selection. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows for each word
          pair indicate the average expression profiles for genes
          that shared both words in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , as well as the
          average expression profile for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that conserved both
          words in multiple genomes, respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, the
          consideration of word-pair conservation yielded further
          increases in average gene-expression profiles compared to
          word pairs in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae alone. Similar
          effects were observed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RRPE</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlapping RRPE</ENAMEX> pairs associated with genes repressed in
          the environmental stress response (see Additional data
          files). Thus, conserved word-pair templates contained
          more specific predictors of gene expression than
          comparable sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">templates</ENAMEX> derived from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae alone.
          To evaluate how well sequence features can explain
          gene expression changes across the whole genome, several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have constructed linear regression models using
          various choices for features [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . The 
          R <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX> statistic of a regression
          model indicates the percent of global variance that can
          be explained using the sequence features in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
          Models with better fits to the genome-wide expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> would thus have greater 
          R <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX> values. To assess the
          sensitivity of individual word pairs in explaining global
          gene expression, we first constructed regression models
          using individual word pairs (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
          We chose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> representative environmental conditions:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid starvation</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ; stationary phase
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> h in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YPD</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] ; and ergosterol inhibition
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">terbinafine</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . We constructed regression models
          using counts of individual words in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae TCRs</ENAMEX>, or using counts
          of words that were conserved among 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saccharomyces TCRs</ENAMEX>. Sequence
          conservation improved the fit of regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> based
          on individual word pairs (Δ 
          R <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.3%</NUMEX>) (see Additional data
          files). These results clearly show that sequences
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in multiple 
          Saccharomyces <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were more
          likely to be associated with gene-expression changes.
          To assess the joint contribution of word pairs on gene
          expression, we also included interaction terms between
          the individual words only if their coefficients were
          statistically significant (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods).
          Pairwise interaction terms, expressed as the product of
          scores for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> features, represent a standard way to
          assess whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> features contribute nonadditively to
          gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Indeed, the inclusion of
          significant pairwise interaction terms improved the fits
          for both the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and
          the conserved sequence model, increasing the 
          R <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX> by a further <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2% to 0.9%</NUMEX>
          (see Additional data files). Whereas the interaction
          terms only comprise a small proportion of the global
          variance, they can be interpreted as statistical evidence
          of dependence between sequence features [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          Therefore, the nonadditive contributions of conserved
          word-pair templates further suggest their involvement in
          multifactorial regulation.
          We expanded these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> to include multiple conserved
          word-pair templates using a stepwise linear regression
          procedure. The set of potential sequence features was
          expanded to include all words found in templates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with significant gene expression changes in
          that condition, as assessed previously by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-S</ENAMEX> test
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The final 
          R <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX> values for regression
          models based on occurrences of multiple words in 
          S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cerevisiae</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2%</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.3%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3and</ENAMEX> see Additional data files). Once again,
          the use of conserved instances of individual words
          yielded better model fits, with improvements in 
          R <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX> values from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.1% to 9.5%</NUMEX>.
          Further improvements in the model fit (Δ 
          R <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5% to 1.4%</NUMEX>) were obtained
          using pairwise interaction terms between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> words
          found in the same word-pair template. The total 
          R <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX> values for the regression
          models based on conserved word-pair templates with
          interaction terms thus ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.8% to 20.2%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Thus, sequence features based on conserved word-pair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">templates</ENAMEX> could explain more of the global gene
          expression changes than features based on 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae alone.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This work describes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principles for analyzing
        combinations of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. First, sequence
        conservation among closely related yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> was used
        to find sequences that were more likely to be functionally
        important. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a template approach that considered
        joint positional distributions of word pairs increased the
        specificity of gene-expression predictions using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sequence</ENAMEX>-based rules. We have demonstrated that
        higher-order sequence features within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> were conserved
        across multiple 
        Saccharomyces genomes. Closely spaced
        and jointly conserved word pairs were also more likely to
        be associated with specific gene-expression changes. A
        large proportion of words contained in templates matched
        known transcription factor binding sites. In many cases,
        associations between templates and gene-expression changes
        were significant in conditions when the corresponding
        transcription factors are known to be active. In addition,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes that co-conserved both words in a template
        often were enriched for common functional roles. These
        results suggest that conserved word-pair templates, which
        were discovered strictly on the basis of higher-order
        properties of sequence conservation, also carry biological
        relevance.
        Conserved word-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair templates</ENAMEX> may be consistent with
        several underlying biochemical mechanisms. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible
        interpretation of templates is that closely spaced sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> may promote direct or indirect interactions between
        transcription factors by increasing the local
        concentrations of the individual factors. For example, the
        proximity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cbf1p</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Met31/32</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may promote
        interaction between these factors in recruiting their
        common transcriptional activators, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Met4p and Met28p</TIMEX>.
        Experimental studies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> of 
        MET3 and 
        MET28 have demonstrated that the
        binding of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cbf1p</TIMEX> enhances the DNA-binding affinity of
        Met31<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/32p</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biochemical</ENAMEX> experiments suggest
        that all these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may interact at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> of some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur-utilization genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Another possible regulatory scheme for conserved,
        closely spaced word pairs is that individual sequences
        found in templates may correspond to binding sites for
        transcription factors that bind independently under the
        same or separate conditions. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Msn2/4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> and Hsf1p
        transcription factors, whose binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were similar to
        words identified in a template, represent an example of
        multifactorial regulation in response to distinct
        environmental stimuli [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Spacing constraints between
        their binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> could nevertheless be important under
        conditions when both factors are active. Recent experiments
        have suggested that transcription factors that do not
        physically interact may still co-activate gene expression
        as long as their binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are spaced within a
        nucleosome length (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 150 bp</TIMEX>), due to
        collaborative competition of the bound transcription
        factors with core histones [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Close spacing between word pairs may be important for
        reasons other than the promotion of transcription factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. Different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> at varying windows
        away from translation start sites may be more competent at
        recruiting or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibiting RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>. These differences
        may be influenced by nucleosome accessibility, chromatin
        structure or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> physical properties, which can be
        correlated with local A+T content (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] for
        references). Notably, we have also found that the relative
        proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A and T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> vary considerably within
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> bp closest to translation start sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.M. Moses</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.B.Eisen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audrey Gasch</ENAMEX>, unpublished results).
        Low-complexity words that contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more As or Ts
        could be found in many templates (denoted by T 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> 
         C in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4and Table 1</ENAMEX>); these words may serve as
        surrogates for a distance window from the translation
        start. Binding sites that are close to these low-complexity
        words may be found in more transcriptionally competent
        regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, the possibility that each
        word in an identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> may be found at similar
        distances from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> conserved sequence element in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TCRs</ENAMEX> cannot be discounted.
        Direct biological models of binding-site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>, as exemplified by conserved word-pair templates,
        provided several advantages over naive statistical models
        based on sequence combinations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae . Average
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiles showed that conserved word pairs
        were more specific predictors of gene expression (giving
        fewer false positives) than single or pairwise sequences
        derived from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , indicating that
        conserved regions among these closely related 
        Saccharomyces <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were enriched
        for functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. The consideration of distance
        constraints between pairs of conserved sequences found many
        more examples than a previous study of binding-site
        clustering for multiple transcription factors in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In addition,
        we discovered new sequences and pairwise interaction terms
        using regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> similar to those reported in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Conserved word-pair templates
        accounted for similar changes in genome-wide expression ( 
        R <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 11%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX>) using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 8 to 10</NUMEX> features, compared
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of overlapping features used by other methods [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> features from our methods
        were more predictive of genome-wide expression changes.
        A key limitation of our approach is the use of hexamers,
        which may fail to capture known binding sites. For example,
        the binding sites for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mcm1p and Rap1p</TIMEX> are poorly modeled by
        exact words, in that these transcription factors bind
        sequences with relaxed specificity at certain positions [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . Our method missed examples of multifactorial
        regulation involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Mcm1p</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rap1p</TIMEX> that were suggested by
        previous work using position-weight matrices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, our method required sequence identity for a word
        to be labeled as conserved. This strict requirement omitted
        binding sites that may have retained their function,
        despite mutations in degenerate positions that may have
        little impact on transcription factor binding. This
        tradeoff between enumerating all possible words and
        capturing degenerate positions in binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was
        compounded by the very large number of pairwise word
        combinations that were enumerated. Further work should
        incorporate more complicated sequence models, as well as
        optimization methods that restrict the search space of
        sequence combinations.
        The consideration of joint conservation and close
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spacing</ENAMEX> has provided insights into how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> may
        influence the multifactorial regulation of gene expression
        in 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These
        criteria were motivated by experimental studies on the
        positional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of individual binding sites within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>, with the hypothesis that this underlying architecture
        would be functionally conserved. Even more complicated
        higher-order sequence rules are apparent in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization of</ENAMEX> 
        cis -regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">modules</ENAMEX> in 
        Drosophila melanogaster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        Nevertheless, a common organizational theme of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> in
        both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> is the importance of relative
        spacing between transcription factor binding sites. The
        discovery of additional principles for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> organization
        will further advance our understanding of how regulatory
        information is encoded in genome sequences.

          Datasets
          Whole-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> sequencing of

          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . All are highly related to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , as they are grouped
          within the 
          sensu stricto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the 
          Saccharomyces genus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          Intergenic regions were aligned using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and are available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yeast</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comparative Genomics</ENAMEX> website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,101</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> alignments were analyzed. These alignments were
          filtered for orthologs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> genomes.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-expression measurements were obtained from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford Microarray Database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosetta</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
          The main experimental types among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">342</NUMEX> conditions
          examined include cell cycle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] , environmental

          inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . This data
          has been log-transformed (base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and each experimental
          condition has been median normalized.
        
        
          Dependent conservation of word pairs
          To assess whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words were co-conserved in the
          same intergenic regions, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test of
          independence was systematically conducted for all
          possible words of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. We defined a word to include
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-bp sequence and its reverse complement. Each
          transcriptional control <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>) for a gene was
          defined as the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600 bp</NUMEX> upstream of its translation start
          site. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> shared between divergently transcribed genes
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600 bp long</NUMEX> were only counted once. A word was
          labeled conserved in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> if all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> were
          identical among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> genomes in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> alignment. For each word pair (

          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> requirement for a conserved sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">template</ENAMEX> involved constraints on spatial arrangements
          between individual words. Any method that evaluates

          account positional biases that may be present for
          individual words (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.M. Moses</ENAMEX>, unpublished results). We
          used a permutation test to evaluate the significance of
          the median of minimum distances, excluding overlaps,

          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the words, but not the word positions
          themselves, we retained the positional biases of

          Correction for multiple testing involved control of
