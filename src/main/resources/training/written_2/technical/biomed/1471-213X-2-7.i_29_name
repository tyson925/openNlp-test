        The adult cuticular surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> is covered with
        hairs, sensory bristles, ridges, scales and other
        structures. In most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> regions individual cuticular
        structures are aligned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the epithelium. The
        basis for the development of this planar or tissue polarity
        has principally been studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ]
        where it is under the control of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frizzled</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> ) pathway [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Many Drosophila
        epidermal cells produce cuticular hairs that are outgrowths
        from the apical surface of pupal epidermal cells. The
        development of epidermal hairs has principally been studied
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> where each pupal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> produces a single
        distally pointing hair. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> controls hair polarity by
        directing the location for hair initiation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In a
        wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type fly hairs</ENAMEX> are formed at the distal most vertex of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> cells and extend distally. Mutations in 
        fz pathway genes result in altered
        sites for hair initiation, which results in altered hair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polarity</ENAMEX> and in some cases altered hair number [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Sensory bristles are found in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidermis</ENAMEX>. Bristles are polarized within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidermis</ENAMEX> and in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> region neighbouring bristles are
        aligned in parallel and point in the same direction as
        neighbouring hairs. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> controls bristle polarity
        by regulating the orientation of the spindle for the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of the sensory organ precursor
        cell [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The ommatidia of the compound eye also display
        a dramatic planar polarity that is under the control of the
        
        fz pathway. In this tissue the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> controls polarity by
        regulating the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">R3/R4</ENAMEX> cell fate decision [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        The arista is the terminal segment of the antenna and it
        is comprised of a central core of epidermal cells, some of
        which elaborate a single lateral extension [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laterals</ENAMEX> and the cells that form them share a number of
        characteristics of both hairs and bristles. The laterals
        are longer than many bristles, but thinner. At the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultrastructural</ENAMEX> level developing laterals resemble bristles
        and not hairs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . They contain a series of large
        bundles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin that are juxtaposed to the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. In addition, microtubules are distributed
        throughout the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>. The
        developing laterals resemble hairs and not bristle in that
        they are formed at the apical surface of epithelial cells
        and they are not innervated.
        Mutations in the genes of the 
        fz pathway result in altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> and
        bristle polarity and in some cases large numbers of cells
        that produce multiple hairs. To determine if the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> played a role in arista
        development we examined the aristae of various 
        fz pathway mutants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 5</NUMEX> ] . We found
        that 
        multiple wing hairs ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mwh</ENAMEX> ), which results in an average of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost 4 hairs</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> also resulted in the
        formation of multipled and branched laterals. However
        unlike the situation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, where 
        mwh results in altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair polarity</ENAMEX>,
        on the arista we did not see any evidence of altered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral polarity</ENAMEX>. We also examined aristae from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inturned</ENAMEX> ( 
        in ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fuzzy</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX> ) mutants. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> mutations
        in these genes result in altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair polarity</ENAMEX> and in many
        cells forming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hairs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . On mutant aristae
        we found that 
        in and 
        fy caused multipled and branched
        laterals, but as was the case for 
        mwh we did not see any evidence for
        altered polarity. We did not detect any mutant phenotype in
        adult aristae of 
        fz , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vang</ENAMEX> ), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dishevelled</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsh</ENAMEX> ), 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">starry night</TIMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stan</ENAMEX> ) also known as - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flamingo</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fmi</ENAMEX> ) or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prickle</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pk</ENAMEX> ) mutants [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It was
        surprising that upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
        fz pathway did not show a mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> while downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> did. We therefore
        examined the situation further. In developing wild type
        pupal aristae <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laterals</ENAMEX> formed near but not at the distal
        edge of aristae central core cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . When we examined
        
        fz, dsh and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stan</ENAMEX> mutants we noted that lateral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">initiation</ENAMEX> was no longer restricted to the distal region of
        central core cells. Although these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laterals</ENAMEX> formed at an
        unusual subcellular location this did not produce a
        noticeable phenotype in the adult. The altered location for
        lateral initiation in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> and other mutants was similar to
        their phenotype in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Prior to hair
        initiation in wing cells <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz, Dsh, Fmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dgo</ENAMEX> accumulate on
        the distal side of wing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dgo</ENAMEX> are also
        thought to accumulate on the proximal side) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX>
        ] . To see if this could be the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
        development we examined the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> in
        developing arista using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fz-GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoding transgene gene</ENAMEX>.
        We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz-GFP</ENAMEX> preferentially accumulated on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distal</ENAMEX> side of arista central core cells much as it does in
        wing cells. In addition, we found that this asymmetric
        localization was lost in 
        dsh mutants but retained in 
        in and 
        fy mutants as is the case in wing
        cells. As is the case in wing cells the distal accumulation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> did not appear to influence <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> development in an
        
        in or 
        fy mutant. Overall the data argue
        that the 
        fz pathway functions in a similar but
        modified way to regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral morphogenesis</ENAMEX> as compared
        to wing hair morphogenesis. We suggest that the absence of
        a noticeable adult phenotype in 
        fz aristae while there is a dramatic
        phenotype on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> is due to inherent differences in the
        cell biology of the relevant cells.
      
      
        Results
        
          The arista phenotype of inturned and fuzzy
          On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, mutations in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inturned</ENAMEX> ( 
          in ) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fuzzy</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX> ) result in both altered hair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polarity</ENAMEX> and in many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> forming more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hair [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . In the arista mutations in these genes do
          not have an obvious polarity phenotype but they do result
          in the production of multipled and split laterals (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1C). We found about two <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral ends per lateral</ENAMEX>
          producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (a wild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type unbranched lateral</ENAMEX> has one
          end per lateral producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Most of these
          cases were due to independent initiation events in the
          same central core cell (â‰… <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</NUMEX>) or to a split near the
          proximal end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral (â</ENAMEX>‰… <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</NUMEX>). In phalloidin
          stained preparations of 
          in and 
          fy mutant heads we saw that early
          in lateral morphogenesis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin accumulated over a
          larger fraction of the distal part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> than in
          wild type (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1I). This wider distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin
          typically resolved into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (or occasionally more)
          actin-filled laterals (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1J,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>). On occasion we saw
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laterals</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX> and 
          in mutants that were branched
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distally</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1K). In a wild type arista the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">initiates</ENAMEX> close to, but not at the distal most boundary
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. On average the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> is located at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of
          the way toward the distal edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In 
          in and 
          fy mutants the proximal most
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lateral</ENAMEX> was located <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 65%</NUMEX> of the way toward the
          distal edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. This was significantly different
          from that in wild type (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). When we made a series
          of timed observations of individual laterals 
          in pupae we found that most cells
          formed multiple independent laterals at a similar time.
          We also saw examples where laterals split during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outgrowth</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The splitting was seen at a variety
          of stages, from early in lateral outgrowth to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as much as</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> or more after lateral initiation. We did not
          detect any delay in lateral initiation or any notable
          change in the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral elongation</ENAMEX> in these mutants
          ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] (data not shown)). As split laterals extended
          there was an increase both in the distance from the
          proximal end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2B,2C) and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>-point to each of the distal
          tips. This is similar to what we have seen with other
          mutations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . That mutations in 
          in and 
          fy cause both independent lateral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">initiations</ENAMEX> and the splitting of single laterals during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outgrowth</ENAMEX> was unexpected, as the multiple wing hair
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> produced by these mutations has been
          interpreted as an effect only on hair initiation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          This result led us to reexamine 
          in and 
          fy adult wings and indeed we were
          able to find small numbers of branched hairs. The
          presence of branched 
          fy hairs was reported previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . Thus the phenotypic difference between the effects
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laterals</ENAMEX> and hairs appears quantitative and not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX>.
          We next attempted to determine the critical time for 
          in function in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> development
          using temperature shift experiments with the temperature
          sensitive allele 
          in II53 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> this
          allele results in a large phenotypic difference when
          pupae grown at the restrictive versus permissive
          temperatures. We found that the phenotypic difference was
          not so dramatic on the laterals, as at the restrictive
          condition <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 55%</NUMEX> of laterals were split or
          multipled while at the permissive condition <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 35%</NUMEX>
          were split or multipled. This difference was still large
          enough to use for the shift experiments. Lateral growth
          takes place over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 18 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29Â°C</TIMEX> and more than
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18Â°C</NUMEX> giving us a wide window for shift
          experiments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In shift experiments we found that
          the crucial time for 
          in function in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> development
          was around the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral initiation</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">26 hours</TIMEX> at
          29Â°C and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> hrs at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18Â°C</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Notably, temperature
          shifts in either direction even shortly after the start
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral outgrowth</ENAMEX> had only minor effects on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. These results are similar to those previously
          obtained on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . It is worth noting that 
          in laterals will sometimes split <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> or more after the end of the 
          in temperature sensitive period. We
          suggest that this is an example where the consequences of
          a mutation are not manifested until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">some hours</TIMEX> after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of action of the gene.
          On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> single and double mutant combinations of 
          in and 
          fy result in a similar phenotype [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . This lack of additivity has been interpreted as
          evidence that these genes function and are required in a
          common process. We compared the multipled lateral
          phenotypes of 
          in and 
          fy single mutants and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX>; in double mutants and found no
          difference consistent with 
          in and 
          fy functioning in the same process
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> development (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In the wing 
          in and 
          fy are epistatic to mutations in 
          fz , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dishevelled</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsh</ENAMEX> ), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prickle</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pk</ENAMEX> ), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vang</ENAMEX> ) (aka 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strabismus</ENAMEX> ) and 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">starry night</TIMEX> (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flamingo</ENAMEX> ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 21</ENAMEX> ] . This was also
          the case in the arista (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          The arista phenotype of mutiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> hairs
          In the wing 
          multiple wing hairs ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mwh</ENAMEX> ) results in similar polarity
          disruptions and a stronger multiple hair cell phenotype
          than 
          in or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 14</ENAMEX> ] . 
          mwh aristae had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 5</NUMEX> lateral
          ends per cell (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D). The laterals were also
          substantially shorter than wild type (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40-45%</NUMEX> of normal
          length). Thus, in the arista laterals as in wing hairs 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mwh</ENAMEX> has a substantially stronger
          phenotype than 
          in or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX>. At early stages in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mwh lateral</ENAMEX> morphogenesis we saw
          multiple locations within individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accumulated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1H). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> stages these appeared as
          multiple independent laterals produced by individual
          cells (Figure 1L,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>). These conclusions were confirmed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-lapse observations ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] (data not shown)). In
          addition, we saw examples where a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> split during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outgrowth</ENAMEX> ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] (data not shown)). There was no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alteration</ENAMEX> in the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> initiation in 
          mwh although we did see a decrease
          in the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral elongation</ENAMEX> that was consistent
          with the short final length of 
          mwh laterals ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] (data not
          shown)). The short length and slow growth may simply be a
          consequence of the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple lateral phenotype</ENAMEX> as
          laterals that were only slightly branched were of
          relatively normal length. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> all double mutant
          combinations of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mwh</ENAMEX> and other 
          fz pathway genes result in a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mwh</ENAMEX> like phenotype [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . For the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> phenotype we found that 
          mwh fz double mutants resembled 
          mwh, as is the case in the wing
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). However, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mwh</ENAMEX> in and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX> ; 
          mwh laterals produced an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenotype</ENAMEX> in terms of the mean number of
          lateral ends per cell (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Thus, the relationship
          between 
          in and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mwh</ENAMEX> appears different in the wing
          and arista, presumably reflecting differences in the
          genetic circuitry in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tissues.
        
        
          The arista phenotype of fz mutants
          We did not see any obvious mutant phenotype in aristae
          from 
          fz, dsh, pk, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vang</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stan</ENAMEX> flies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>,
          mutations in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> and these other 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fz</ENAMEX> like genes result in hairs with
          abnormal polarity due to a failure to restrict prehair
          initiation to the distal most part of the cell [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          Only infrequently does this result in a cell forming more
          than one hair. When we examined the development of 
          fz mutant laterals by phalloidin
          staining we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral initiation</ENAMEX> was not as
          restricted to the distal part of cells as is the case in
          wild type (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1F) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Rather laterals formed at
          a wide range of locations along the proximal distal axis
          of the extended central core cells. For 
          fz , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1G) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stan</ENAMEX> (data not shown) the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
          formed at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX> of the way toward the distal edge of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, which was significantly different from that of
          wild type. This was slightly more distal than we saw for 
          in and 
          fy but not significantly so (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pk</ENAMEX> and 
          Vang mutants the average location
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral initation</ENAMEX> was slightly less distal than in
          wild type (â‰… <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> vs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>) and this difference was only
          marginally significant. The position for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
          initiation in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pk</ENAMEX> and 
          Vang was clearly different from
          that of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fz</ENAMEX> .
        
        
          Fz accumulates asymmetrically in arista
          cells
          The initiation of wing hairs in the vicinity of the
          distal most vertex of wing cells is preceded by the
          preferential accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fz protein</ENAMEX> along the distal
          side of wing cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . To determine if the distal
          initiation of laterals was also associated with the
          preferential accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fz</ENAMEX> we examined aristae that
          expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fz</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> under the control of the 
          armadillo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. This construct
          is expressed at a low enough rate so that the subcellular
          localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is still preferentially
          found along the distal edge of wing cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strutt</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
          We found that Fz <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> also accumulated preferentially
          along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distal</ENAMEX>/proximal edges of arista central core
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This could be detected both before and
          during <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral outgrowth</ENAMEX>. The ratio of the intensity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> flourescence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">distal versus lateral</ENAMEX> sides of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.7 to 2.4</NUMEX> in different aristae
          preparations. This is similar to the ratio for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fz</ENAMEX>-GFP
          that we have seen in wing cells. The emerging laterals
          were found close to but not overlapping this region. From
          our experiments we could not distinguish between
          preferential location along the distal edge, proximal
          edge or both. Based on analogy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> situation we
          suggest it at the distal edge of the cells. In occasional
          cells that bulged out from the central core this appeared
          to be the case. The distal accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz-GFP</ENAMEX> could
          be detected until late in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> development. At this
          time the cells become highly elongated along the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">proximal/distal</ENAMEX> axis and it becomes difficult to assess
          what the distal edge is (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>).
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> the accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> at the distal edge
          of the cell requires the function of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsh</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . We examined aristae
          from 
          dsh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; 
          arm-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fz</NUMEX>-GFP pupae and found that the
          preferential distal accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> was lost (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          The ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence on the distal versus
          laterals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>. Thus, as
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> the distal accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> in arista cells
          is dependent on 
          dsh function. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> Dsh
          accumulates preferentially along the distal edge of wing
          cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dsh-GFP</ENAMEX> also accumulated
          along the distal edge of arista cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> the distal accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> is not
          dependent on the function of 
          in or 
          fy , although in 
          in and 
          fy mutants the distal accumulation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> is no longer able to restrict hair formation to the
          distal edge of the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . We examined the
          distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> in 
          arm-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fz</NUMEX>-GFP; in and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fz</NUMEX>-GFP aristae. The
          preferential distal accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> was still present
          in these arista cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) (we obtained distal to
          lateral edge ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>), although the 
          in and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fy mutant lateral phenotype</ENAMEX> was
          obvious. Thus, 
          fz , 
          in and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fy</ENAMEX> appear to have a similar
          relationship in the arista and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>.
          There are a number of striking similarities in the
          morphogenesis of hairs, laterals and bristles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> presented here for laterals and previously for wing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hairs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] show that the asymmetric accumulation of Fz
          is prominent in these terminally differentiating cells.
          Given these observations we might expect that this would
          also be true for bristles. The bristle sense organ is a
          multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with the cells organized in a
          3-dimensional arrangement making it difficult to observe
          Fz localization in all of these cells. The socket cell
          that surrounds the growing shaft remains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of
          the adult epidermis and is easy to observe in whole mount
          preparations of pupal epidermis. The socket <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is also
          polarized in the same direction as the shaft as it is
          higher on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side than the other. We examined the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation of Fz-GFP</ENAMEX> in differentiating socket cells
          and found that it was asymmetrically distributed both
          early and late in bristle differentiation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In
          most cells that we observed it appeared to accumulate on
          both the proximal and distal (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dorsal/ventral</ENAMEX> etc.) edges
          of the socket cells. We cannot be certain from these
          observations if it was accumulating in the socket <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> or
          in the neighboring epidermal cells. The level of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fz</ENAMEX>-GFP
          appeared higher than in typical epidermal cells
          suggesting that we are looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz-GFP</ENAMEX> present in the
          socket cell. The ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence at high to low
          regions was similar (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>) to what we obtained for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wing</ENAMEX> and arista cells. It was reported previously that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fmi/Stan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> accumulated to a higher level in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>
          cell that forms the bristle lineage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Previous
          experiments have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> regulates orientation of
          the spindle in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of the PI cell of the bristle
          sense organ lineage and it has been thought that this is
          the way that 
          fz regulated bristle polarity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6</NUMEX>
          ] . Our observations suggest that 
          fz may also play a later role in
          specifying bristle polarity that is analogous to its role
          in regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> development.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In wing cells the distal assembly of the hair is
        preceded by the preferential accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz, Dsh</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fmi/Stan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Diego</ENAMEX> along the distal edge of the cell [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . This provides a cortical mark that is thought
        to specify the proximal-distal axis of the cells. In these
        cells the region for hair initiation overlaps, but is only
        a small part of the region where these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> accumulate.
        It is unclear how the cytoskeleton is activated in this
        restricted region. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fz</ENAMEX> receptor
        protein complex directly interacts with and activates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that stimulate the cytoskeleton to produce a hair
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In the arista we also see a preferential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation of Fz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distal</ENAMEX>/proximal edges of
        cells and this likely serves a similar function as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">cortical</ENAMEX> mark. It is worth noting however, that the
        location for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral outgrowth</ENAMEX> does not directly overlap
        with the location for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> accumulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 7</ENAMEX>). Although
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> is formed in the distal region of the cell it
        is not juxtaposed to the junctional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> cell
        periphery where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> accumulates. Rather laterals in wild
        type flies form on the apical surface of arista cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, in arista cells it is unlikely that there
        is any direct connection between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> receptor complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that accumulate distally and the actin
        cytoskeleton of the laterals. More likely in this cell type
        the distal accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> activates
        a signal transduction pathway that activates the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> through a diffusible signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The JNK
        pathway, which has been implicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fz</ENAMEX> signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> in the eye is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> pathway to be
        involved in this ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] ). We note that a
        diffusible signal could be part of the mechanism that is
        used to restrict hair initiation to a smaller part of wing
        cells than the region where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fz</ENAMEX> accumulates.
        Based on the precedent from wing cells it is at first
        glance surprising that an alteration in the site for
        lateral initiation does not produce obvious phenotypic
        consequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Pupal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> cells are relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotropic</ENAMEX> in terms of their shape in the planar direction.
        The assembly of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> at the cell periphery puts it in
        close proximity to the junctional complex perhaps allowing
        for direct interactions between the cortical and hair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeletons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . This could provide orientation
        guidance for the growing hair. In a 
        fz mutant, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> formation no
        longer takes place at the cell periphery this guidance
        would be lost (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In an 
        in mutant, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> formation takes
        place at alternative locations on the cell periphery, it
        would be incorrect (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Lateral forming cells are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongated</ENAMEX> in the proximal distal direction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) and
        laterals grow out at a large angle to the apical surface of
        the central core cells. In this way wild type laterals
        resemble 
        fz mutant wing cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Thus,
        early in their development laterals are not close to the
        junctional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> or the prominent cortical cytoskeleton
        at the cell periphery and are unlikely to be getting any
        orientation guidance in this way. In a 
        fz mutant lateral the location along
        the proximal distal axis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is changed but there
        is no disruption of a close connection to the cortical
        cytoskeleton as there is in hair cells. In the mutant there
        is no change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dorsal</ENAMEX>/ventral position for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
        outgrowth or the angle of the outgrowth to the apical
        surface. In part this may be due to limitations inherent in
        a relatively large lateral growing out of a long thin cell.
        It is also worth considering that the elongated shape of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> forming cells becomes much more extreme as
        development proceeds (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This brings the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laterals</ENAMEX> close to the cell edges that are parallel to the
        proximal distal axis of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">core</ENAMEX> and the junctional
        complexes at these edges could provide orientation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies on 
        in and 
        fy function in regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> hair
        development have focused on their role in regulating the
        site for hair initiation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 20</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Observations</ENAMEX> reported
        in this paper show that multiple laterals associated with 
        in and 
        fy mutants can arise either from
        independent initiation events or from the splitting of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">elongating lateral</ENAMEX>. The splitting of laterals could be due
        to a need for 
        in and 
        fy function during the outgrowth
        process or to a need for 
        in and 
        fy function at initiation with the
        consequences only being manifested at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX>. We
        carried out a set of temperature shift experiments to
        distinguish between these possibilities. These shift
        experiments showed that the essential time for 
        in function in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> development is
        around the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral initiation</ENAMEX>. This is similar to
        what we previously found for 
        in function in wing hair development
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . It is interesting that the consequences of a lack
        of 
        in function in laterals are
        manifested some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after the end of the 
        in temperature sensitive period. We
        suggest that in an 
        in mutant there is a subtle defect in
        a cytoskeleton-organizing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> that promotes lateral
        outgrowth. The defect is not severe enough to block or
        dramatically slow <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral outgrowth</ENAMEX>. In some cells it leads
        to the formation of multiple initiation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and in others
        to an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unstable lateral</ENAMEX> that is subject to splitting. A
        similar phenomenon could explain the formation of
        occasional branched wing hairs in 
        in, fy and 
        mwh wings. It could also explain
        differences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> and bristle phenotypes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tricornered</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trc</ENAMEX> ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furry</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fry</ENAMEX> ) mutants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 26</NUMEX> ] . In such
        mutants bristles and laterals are often branched. In
        contrast, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trc</ENAMEX> and 
        fry wing cells have a very dramatic
        multiple hair cells phenotype (average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5</NUMEX> hairs
        per cell). The multiple hairs are found primarily in
        clusters of independent hairs with only occasional branched
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hairs</ENAMEX>. We suggest that there is a common defect in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trc</ENAMEX> and 
        fry bristles, laterals and hairs.
        Differences in the phenotypes would be due to inherent
        differences in the sensitivity of these cell types to the
        defective organizing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. The smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hairs</ENAMEX> would be
        more sensitive to the defects leading to "spitting" during
        the initial stages of growth, which would result in what
        appears to be a cluster of independent hairs. The larger
        structures (laterals and bristles) could be less sensitive
        so that the consequences of the abnormal organizing center
        would only be manifested later in morphogenesis if at
        all.
        Previous observations had indicated that the 
        fz pathway functioned in the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">planar polarity</ENAMEX> in hairs, bristles and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ommatidia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 14</NUMEX> ] . Consistent with much current
        thinking on signal transduction pathways it has been
        suggested that there is a core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of 
        fz pathway of genes that function
        similarly in different cell types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Downstream genes
        would function to interpret the signal from the core group
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a cell type specific way. As attractive as this
        idea is a number of observations suggest that much of the 
        fz pathway is modified in cell type
        specific ways. For example, the asymmetric accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fmi/Stan</ENAMEX> in wing cells is essential for marking the distal
        edge of wing cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fmi/Stan</ENAMEX> does not
        accumulate asymmetrically in sensory organ precursor cell
        that gives rise to the bristle sense organ although the
        orientation of the pI cell spindle is altered in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fmi/stan mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Our
        observations on the arista suggest that the genetic
        circuitry of the 
        fz pathway is modified in a different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> in this cell type. The most notable differences were
        the lack of a substantial phenotype in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pk</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vang</ENAMEX> and that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mwh</ENAMEX> is not epistatic to 
        in and 
        fy as it the case on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this paper we provide evidence that a modified
        version of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frizzled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> regulates the
        development of arista laterals. As is the case for the wing
        the asymmetrical accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fz protein</ENAMEX> appears to
        produce a cortical mark that is used to control where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> is activated to produce a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Fly strains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit</ENAMEX> flies were grown on standard media. Many of the
          mutations were isolated in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> and described
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 20 27 28</ENAMEX> ] . Several were obtained from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
          Strutt kindly provided flies carrying the 
          arm-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fz</NUMEX>-GFP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.</ENAMEX>
          Axelrod kindly provided flies carrying a 
          dsh-GFP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> (this construct
          uses the endogenous 
          dsh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Temperature
          shift experiments were done as previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytological</ENAMEX> procedures
          Standard techniques were used. In most staining
          experiments pupae were fixed in phosphate buffered saline
          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde. Actin staining was
          done as described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexa</ENAMEX> 568
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phalloidin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>). For experiments where we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualized</ENAMEX> GFP we made an effort to use the minimum
          amount of fixation compatible with maintaining the
          morphology of the aristae.
        
        
          Microscopy
          Confocal images were obtained using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioRad</ENAMEX> confocal
          microscope at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keck Center for Biological Imaging</ENAMEX> at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX>. Other images were obtained
          using a Spot digital camera (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Diagnostics</ENAMEX>) on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeiss Axioskop</ENAMEX> microscope using bright <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> optics.
          Length measurements were made using either the software
          provided with the Spot camera or by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> tool
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Photoshop</ENAMEX>. To measure the intensity of
          GFP-fluorescence we took maximal projections of optical
          sections and used the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Psion</ENAMEX> port of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Image</ENAMEX>
          software to analyze the data. The tif images were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inverted</ENAMEX> and the intensity plotted along an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> pixel line
          drawn across the relevant cell boundary. The background
          was estimated by the lowest reading along the line and
          this was subtracted from the highest reading to obtain an
          intensity measurement. The same procedure was done for a
          line drawn along a "low" intensity cell border. Multiple
          cells were scored (usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) from the same projection,
          averages obtained used to provide an intensity ratio.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Excel</ENAMEX> was used to analyze the data (calculating
          means, standard deviation, and plotting). To measure the
          location along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proximal</ENAMEX>/distal axes of arista cells
          we took micrographs of actin stained aristae where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lateral</ENAMEX> was small (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1/3</NUMEX> the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>)
          and measured the distance from the proximal to distal
          sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. We also measured the distance from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> side to the distal edge of the base of the
          growing lateral where it was connected to the central
          core. The ratio of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> values is used as a measure
          of the location for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral initiation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scoring</ENAMEX> of arista phenotypes
          Adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aristae</ENAMEX> were mounted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gary</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magic Mountant</ENAMEX>
          and examined under bright field microscope.
        
        
          In vivoimaging of the arista laterals
          Carefully aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pupae</TIMEX> were washed and air-dried. In
          early experiments they were then attached to standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscope</ENAMEX> slides with double-stick tape or to shallow
          well slides using super <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glue</ENAMEX>. In both preparations the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were placed with their ventral side up. Pupal
          cases were opened anteriorly. At various time points they
          were examined by microscope under bright <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field optics</ENAMEX> in
          a drop of water using a water immersion objective (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">40Ã—</ENAMEX>).
          After observation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was removed from the slides and
          the pupae were then kept in a humid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX> for
          further development and observations. Most pupae
          tolerated the treatment, reached the pharate adult stage
          and were morphologically normal. More recently we built a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber spacers</ENAMEX>, double stick tape and a
          cover-slip. The pupae were placed on the double stick
          tape ventral side up and the pupal case opened. A small
          amount of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> gelatin, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> glycerol was place on the
          anterior end of the pupae and between the opened pupae
          and the cover slip. Although the optics are not quite as
          good as with our earlier approaches, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> approach
          is less time consuming and can be used for automated time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lapse</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX> was used in the quantitative analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>. We used t-test and Z test in different
          experiments for comparing different genotypes.
