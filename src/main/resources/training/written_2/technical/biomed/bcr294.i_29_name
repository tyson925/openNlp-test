          Introduction
          A complete understanding of the genetic events
          involved in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> and their heterogeneity
          in relation to stage specificity will be critical to the
          development of successful treatments. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> recently reported the presence of a novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOH</ENAMEX> region in band 18p11.3 in non-small cell lung
          carcinomas, glioblastomas and invasive breast carcinomas
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. This current study uses informative loci in
          18p11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> to investigate the stage specificity and extent
          of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> exhibited by this locus in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> progression. These results are analyzed in
          conjunction with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> data available for markers on
          3p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17p</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">17q</ENAMEX> in an effort to place
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 18p</ENAMEX> alterations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
          progression pathway.
        
        
          Materials and methods
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> used in this study, consisting of
          formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology</ENAMEX>, has
          been previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Tumors were selected at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> for those with the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>
          representing multiple stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast disease</ENAMEX> within
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> samples. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foci</ENAMEX> representing
          normal, intraductal and infiltrating tumor were
          microdissected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> tumors. Matching normal and tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were subjected to polymerase chain reaction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>)-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> analysis using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 18p11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> markers
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D18S59 and D18S481</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> 18p11.2 marker (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D18S452</NUMEX>).
          Forward primers were synthesized with either a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescent</ENAMEX> FAM tag (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D18S481 and D18S452</TIMEX>) or a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">fluorescent TET tag</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D18S59</NUMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions
          were performed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 Î</TIMEX>¼l with aliquots of normal and tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> using a PCR protocol consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">94Â°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> s,
          55Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">72Â°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX> for a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          cycles. Horizontal ultrathin, high throughput
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fluorescence</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment gel electrophoresis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GTI-9600</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genesys Technologies, Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sauk City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
          was applied to the separation and analysis of
          PCR-generated alleles as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
          Allelic ratios were calculated and expressed as a
          percentage of loss of intensity for the tumor allele
          compared with the corresponding normal allele (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-value)
          after normalization.
        
        
          Results
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> foci were analyzed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at several
          polymorphic markers in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p11.3</NUMEX>. The overall frequency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18p11.3</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">27/43</NUMEX>). When analyzed by tumor
          stage, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18p</TIMEX> was found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/16</NUMEX>) of ductal
          carcinoma 
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">situ</TIMEX> (DCIS) foci, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> of
          invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) foci (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14/21</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/6</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic disease</ENAMEX>. A schematic diagram of these
          results appears in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          We also examined the extent of heterogeneity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with chromosome 18p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In tumors
          where information was attainable for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more disease
          stages, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/15</NUMEX>) displayed a pattern of classic clonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> stage for the
          majority. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> tumors (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>) were, however, interestingly
          identified with genetic heterogeneity for chromosome 18p
          events where DCIS-identified events were not found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> invasive foci. Genetic events involving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 18p</ENAMEX> sequences thus do not follow a classic
          progression paradigm in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> cases analyzed as
          part of this study.
        
        
          Discussion
          Significant LOH on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p11.3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>) suggests
          the presence of a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene(s) with
          an important role in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>.
          These measured allelic deletions represented alterations
          confined to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18p11.3</NUMEX> and not whole chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> loss
          based on results using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker D18S452</ENAMEX>, although the
          presence of simultaneous but independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18q</TIMEX> was
          not examined. It was discovered, by analyzing multiple
          foci occurring simultaneously within individual tumors,
          that chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p</NUMEX> events occur at a significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequency</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>) early in the tumorigenic process, making
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p one</NUMEX> of the most common known events
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> tumors. A slightly higher frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in IDC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>) as well as in the small number of metastatic
          samples studied further supports this early event
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>. The majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>) of these breast tumors
          progressed in a clonal fashion. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>) were,
          however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of genetic heterogeneity. Such
          heterogeneity at multiple loci may account for treatment
          failure, and a combinatorial histological and genetic
          approach with sufficient information on survival and
          response profiles may provide more effective disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX> and cure in the future.

          Introduction
          The molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogenetic</ENAMEX> pathway of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast tumor</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> is not yet clearly defined. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chromosomes 1, 3p</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 13q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>,
          18q, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22q</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> have all been reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>], their
          relationship to known genes and, more specifically, to
          different stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast disease</ENAMEX> is still under
          investigation. Studies in benign fibroadenomas and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibrocystic disease</ENAMEX> showed no LOH on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11p</TIMEX>,
          17p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17q</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18q</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> of ductal hyperplasias
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> of atypical ductal hyperplasias exhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>],
          suggesting that these foci are benign <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> resulting
          from the alteration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor genes.
          Furthermore, the discovery that morphologically normal
          terminal duct-lobule units adjacent to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX>
          exhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 60%</NUMEX> of cases when analyzed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 3p</ENAMEX> markers indicates these genetic events can
          be cryptically present before histopathological
          abnormalities are identifiable [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          These aforementioned studies and other research
          support the idea that events affecting tumor suppressors
          can occur early and that preinvasive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> can be a direct
          precursor of invasive carcinoma, a paradigm supported
          pathologically by the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DCIS lesions</ENAMEX> found in
          areas adjacent to invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. These
          same analyses also confirm the complexity of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple lesions</ENAMEX> from individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, for example, reveals the presence of intratumoral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. Markers on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9p</NUMEX>, in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study, demonstrate loss of opposite alleles in
          different ducts while examples of ducts retaining both
          alleles were also found [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. An extensive analysis of
          markers on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11p15</NUMEX> showed LOH early in breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (DCIS), although examples of late stage LOH
          without concomittant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> involvement were also found [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. This indicates that different components from an
          individual tumor can represent genetically divergent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, even at the preinvasive stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX>. The
          heterogeneous nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> alterations could
          have important implications for the development of
          targeted therapies.
          If LOH events define a localized region of increased
          risk for carcinoma, the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> may be clinically
          important. A complete understanding of all the genetic
          events involved in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> and their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in relation to stage specificity will
          therefore be critical to the development of successful
          treatments. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have
          reported the presence of a previously unidentified region
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in band 18p11.3 in non-small cell lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinomas</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glioblastomas</ENAMEX> and a small series (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX>) of invasive breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. The current study uses informative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loci</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p11.3</NUMEX> to investigate, in microdissected
          material, the stage specificity and extent of molecular
          heterogeneity exhibited by chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p11</NUMEX> in breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer progression</ENAMEX>. A series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> tumors from which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
          multiple stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> have been microdissected,
          including normal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDC</ENAMEX> material, were studied.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated</ENAMEX> metastases were also examined in some cases.
          These results were analyzed in conjunction with other LOH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> available for markers on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17p</TIMEX>, and
          17q in an effort to place chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p</NUMEX> alterations on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer progression pathway</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Materials and methods
          
            Patient material
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> used in this study, consisting of
            formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archives of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology</ENAMEX>,
            has been previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Tumors were
            selected at random for those with the presence of
            lesions representing multiple stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast disease</ENAMEX>
            within individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> samples. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> foci
            representing normal, intraductal and infiltrating tumor
            were microdissected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> tumors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">One-half</ENAMEX> of the
            patient samples contained both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDC</ENAMEX> components.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had invasive component material with

            these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">microdissected lesions</ENAMEX> were used as the source
            template for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> analysis.

            collected while running the electrophoresis and stored
            using the accompanying Cartographer data analysis
            software program, which extracts the pixel intensity of
            individual peaks present in a lane trace, allowing for
            sizing of alleles and quantitation of fluorescent peak

            occurred at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>, allelic ratios were
            calculated and expressed as a percentage of loss of
            intensity for the tumor allele compared with the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX>. When the allelic ratio in the tumor DNA
            was reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 40%</NUMEX> (DO<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX>) from that found
            in the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, the sample was denoted as having LOH

            Chromosome 18p11 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
            progression
            A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> foci were individually microdissected
            from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> cases and analyzed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at the
            polymorphic markers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D18S59 and D18S481</TIMEX> spanning
            18p11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">microdissections</ENAMEX> resulted in normal,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDC</ENAMEX> material from most tumors. The overall
            frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">18p11.3</ENAMEX>, as measured for any stage
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D18S481</ENAMEX> and/or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D18S59</TIMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">27/43</NUMEX>). This is significantly higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>
            frequency originally reported using non-microdissected
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IDC samples</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], suggesting that allelic deletion
            events may have been masked by contaminating normal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stroma</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> studies. A low frequency (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/96</NUMEX>) of
            microsatellite instability was also detected at marker
            D18S59. These microsatellite instability results were
            confirmed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> independent experiments and
            correspond to previous published results for this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18p</TIMEX> was found, when analyzed by tumor stage,
            in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/16</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> foci, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDC</ENAMEX> foci (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14/21</NUMEX>),
            and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/6</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic disease</ENAMEX>. A schematic
            representation of all tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foci</ENAMEX> studied appears in
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The magnitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> detected indicates that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in this region generally occur early in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> progression. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases (cases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 18</TIMEX>,
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>), however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> was not detected until the
            invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases (cases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>) LOH
            was only detected in metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This
            suggests that allelic deletion in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p11.3</NUMEX> may also
            arise late in progression, albeit with less frequency.
            Such heterogeneity in the stage specificity of genetic
            events has also been shown for other chromosomal
            regions harboring <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor loci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>].
            The extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> is specific to band 18p11.3
            was determined by analysis with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker D18S452</ENAMEX>. This
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> resides at the border between bands 18p11.3 and
            18p11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12</NUMEX> cM proximal to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D18S481</TIMEX>. Of
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> tumor foci with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18p11.3</NUMEX> and for which
            D18S452 was informative, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/15</NUMEX>) retained
            heterozygosity at this 18p11.2 marker. The majority of
            measured deletion events being detected are thus
            intrachromosomal events rather than loss of the entire
            chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>.
          
          
            Heterogeneity of 18p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
            progression
            Previous genetic studies have shown that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">heterogeneous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> exist for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>]. We could examine, by studying
            multistage individually microdissected tumor components
            from the same specimen, the extent of heterogeneity
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with chromosome 18p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In tumors
            where allelic loss information was attainable for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
            or more disease stages, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/15</NUMEX>) displayed a pattern
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> indicative of a classic clonal progression. LOH
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> stage for the majority of
            these cases (cases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 9, 31, 39, 47, 51 and 53</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
            tumors were, however, interestingly identified with
            genetic heterogeneity for chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p</NUMEX> events. LOH
            detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> component was not found in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated IDC</ENAMEX> component in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases (tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>), suggesting that the invasive foci arose from cells
            other than those associated with the analyzed DCIS
            focus. Microsatellite instability and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> distinguish
            multiple pathways of progression in the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> (cases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 27</TIMEX>). Thus, although genetic events
            involving chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p</NUMEX> sequences most often follow a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX> progression paradigm, a significant proportion
            (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>) do not.
          
          
            Correlations of allelic loss in chromosome
            18p
            Realizing that loss on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18p</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> part of the
            complex genetic profile for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, we sought to
            discover whether genetic alteration on this chromosome
            correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in other regions known to undergo
            allelic deletion in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. These tumors had previously
            been shown to have undergone allelic deletion on
            chromosomes 3p (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9p</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11p</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX>),
            16q (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17p</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17q</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> results
            specifically for those tumors also showing detectable
            chromosome 18p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> are presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. In every
            instance where information was available, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> on
            chromosomes 3p (region <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C13-CA373-D3S1300</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9p</TIMEX> (region
            D9S171<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-D9S1748</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17p</TIMEX> (region D17S1832-D17S1788
            including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17q</TIMEX> (region THRA1-D17S928 including
            nm23) was present when 18p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> occurred. Chromosome 16q
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> (region D16S496<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-D16S513</ENAMEX>), in contrast, was only
            found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>, chromosome 13q (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D13S260-D13S263</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>,
            and chromosome 11p (region D11S922-D11S988 including
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TH</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> of tumors also having 18p <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX>. These
            frequencies suggest that alterations on chromosome 18p
            occur more often in the presence of alterations
            affecting regions containing such tumor suppressors as
            p16 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9p</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17p</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], while events on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosomes 13q</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16q and 11p</TIMEX> occur more
            independently.
          
        
        
          Discussion
          Current knowledge about the progression of breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> reveals that, by analogy to colon and brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aberrations</ENAMEX> can occur in a disease stage
          or grade specific manner. Clonal evolution is, however, a
          dynamic process from which clones that are not
          necessarily committed to a malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phenotype</ENAMEX> can also
          emerge, resulting in genetic heterogeneity in the tissue.
          Such genetic heterogeneity has been described for
          multiple loci in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 11, 16, 19, 20</TIMEX>],
          providing an understanding of the complex picture of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> pathogenesis. Such an understanding is
          necessary if detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> or other genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> will ever allow for consistent and useful
          identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preinvasive breast lesions</ENAMEX> at higher
          risk of progression.
          The present study investigated stage specificity and
          level of genetic heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> events in a new
          region (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18p11.3</NUMEX>) involved in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> for chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p11.3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>) was discovered using
          microdissected foci, suggesting the presence of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">putative tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor gene(s) on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18p</TIMEX> with an
          important role in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. The
          frequency reported in the present study (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>) is
          significantly higher than the original reported frequency
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and most probably reflects the superior
          separation of tumor cells from normal contaminating
          tissue using a microdissection protocol. A series of
          unrelated microdissected DCIS tumors for which no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> component was present also show this high LOH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequency</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>) when measured at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18p11.3</NUMEX> (data not
          shown), suggesting the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> frequency reported in the
          present study is not a consequence of analyzing samples
          containing multiple stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. These measured
          allelic deletions represent alterations specific to
          18p11.3 and not entire chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> events based on
          results using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker D18S452</ENAMEX>, although the presence of
          simultaneous but independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18q</TIMEX> was not
          examined.
          It was discovered, by analyzing multiple foci
          occurring simultaneously within individual tumors, that
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p</NUMEX> events occur at a significant frequency
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>) early in the tumorigenic process, making LOH at
          chromosome 18p one of the most common known events in
          DCIS tumors. For <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> of the cases in which multiple
          stages of disease arose simultaneously and for which
          information on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> marker was available, 18p11.3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIS</ENAMEX> component could also be found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> component isolated for analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
          suggests that the majority of breast tumors progress in a
          clonal fashion. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>) were, however,
          consistent with genetic heterogeneity at this chromosomal
          region. These latter observations argue that invasive
          foci of an individual tumor can represent genetically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">divergent</ENAMEX> clones rather than progressive stages of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Such conclusions are further supported by flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytometric</ENAMEX> and comparative genomic hybridization analyses
          on primary and metastatic disease components [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>].
          In the comparative genomic hybridization study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic lesions</ENAMEX> showed a high degree of clonal
          progression from the primary tumor, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> did not.
          These frequencies parallel the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70% clonal/30%</NUMEX>
          heterogeneous progression frequencies reported for
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18p</NUMEX> events in the present study.
          We are not yet at a stage in our understanding of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast disease</ENAMEX> such that genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alterations</ENAMEX> can
          substitute for the histopathology of the lesion. A
          combinatorial histological and genetic approach with
          sufficient information on survival and response profiles
          may, however, make for more effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> prevention
          and cure in the future. The power of genetic profiles in
          prognostic relevance has recently been shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emi</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Studying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> loci in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">264</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emi</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> at markers
          1p34, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q12</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">17p13.3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">17q21.1</ENAMEX>, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1p34/17</NUMEX>p13.3 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13q12/17</NUMEX>p13<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>), had significant
          prognostic value and carried significant relative risk of
          death. It would be interesting, given the high frequency
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> discovered for chromosomal region 18p11.3 in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, to include this marker along with these regions
          to determine its usefulness as a predictive risk marker
          in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
          To that extent, it was interesting to view a partial
          genetic profile for other regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> in these tumors
          when chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> was present. Chromosome 18p LOH
          always occurred in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOH</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9p</TIMEX>, 17p
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">17q</NUMEX> independent of tumor stage, suggesting this group
          of loci were critical to the development of breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Allelic deletion on chromosomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16q</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13q</ENAMEX> and 11p
          occurred less consistently (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 and 46%</NUMEX>,
          respectively), suggesting these regional events are more
          varied depending on the stage and/or type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> foci
          analyzed. Of further interest is the putative tumor
          suppressor gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DAL-1</ENAMEX>, which has recently been mapped to
          chromosome band 18p11.3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. It will be important to
          learn more about the function of this gene and its
          potential mutational profile in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Future
          studies will determine whether this or another tumor
          suppressor gene is the target of the high frequency of
          allelic deletion measured in this study for breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
