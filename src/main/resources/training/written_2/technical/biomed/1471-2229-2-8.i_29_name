        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Great Plains</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, stand
        density of cultivars within hard red <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRWW</ENAMEX>; 
        Triticum aestivum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>) varies in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">spring</ENAMEX>, depending on the severity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. Generally,
        northern selections have the greatest chance of maintaining
        stands when compared to southern-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cultivars</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, this distinction among cultivars happens only when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> receive adequate cold induction. This occurs
        naturally in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> after planting [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . It also may
        be initiated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> during a period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 6</NUMEX> wk
        at near freezing temperatures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenefick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swanson</ENAMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] described this interval of induction as "cold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acclimation</ENAMEX>".
        Several physiological and biochemical changes
        distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> genotypes during and after cold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acclimation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . One such distinction among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypes</ENAMEX> is tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content that decreases more
        rapidly in certain genotypes than others during the cool
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn season</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] observed from
        field results that northern selections contained less
        tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> than did those selected farther
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> freezing conditions are less severe.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nass</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] observed similar differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">plant</ENAMEX> water
        content among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX> ( 
        Secale cereale <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>) cultivars.
        The reduction of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content in response to low
        temperature is believed to be due to an impedance of water
        uptake by the roots [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Reduced root hydraulic
        conductance occurs shortly after plants are transferred
        from warm to cooler temperatures. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bolger</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] observed this effect
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> after cotton ( 
        Gossypium hirsutum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were
        transferred from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 to 18Â°C</TIMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        observed a decrease in hydraulic conductance of spring
        wheat roots within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were transferred
        from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 to 8Â°C</TIMEX>. However our research focuses on effects of
        a sustained cold acclimation period as occurs in late
        autumn rather than on changes due to transient temperature
        shifts.
        The effect of cool temperatures on lowering water
        content in northern-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cultivars</ENAMEX> could result from i)
        inhibited plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> loss
        exceeding uptake. If <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> temperatures impede water
        uptake, causing greater reduction of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content
        in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HRWW</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> as suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] , then we hypothesized that less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> would be
        removed from soil at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX> by northern-selected than by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> cultivars. This hypothesis was tested by comparing
        foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content and plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake of a northern
        and a southern cultivar at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX> and a photosynthetic photon
        flux density (PPFD) at or near light compensation.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼mol m -2s -1and 2Â°C</ENAMEX> both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> maintained a
          healthy green color after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>, and resumed growth
          when re-hydrated and returned to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>. When the mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foliage</ENAMEX> dry weight (FDW) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> per cultivar (and
          each treatment interval) were plotted against durations
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 2, 4</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> representing rate
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDW</ENAMEX> change of each cultivar were not significantly
          different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (data not shown). It was concluded
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were near or at light compensation.

          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> at 2Â°C
          To evaluate the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> in relation to
          reported field results, changes in foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content
          were measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g H</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 OÂ·g FFW</ENAMEX> -1in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">0.63 g H</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 OÂ·g FFW</ENAMEX> -1in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. This
          reflected a greater reduction of foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> since the starting amount of each was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>
          g H 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 OÂ·g FFW -1</ENAMEX>. Thus even with this
          approximate measurement of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> status a
          differential in foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> was
          demonstrated after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX> exposure.
          A further test was performed to determine to what
          extent foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content decreased in plants
          maintained under our laboratory conditions. Foliage water
          content values were determined from the foliage wet
          weight and dry weight values as described in methods. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hr drying at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">80Â°C</NUMEX> ensured the complete drying of the
          sample and thus accurate determination of foliage dry
          weight. A similar reduction in foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> was shown after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> wk at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A).
          However after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 wk</TIMEX> there was a greater reduction of
          foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, amounting to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>
          compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5.8%</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Thus a differential
          reduction in foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> is
          comparable to that observed in northern and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX>-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRWW</ENAMEX> genotypes observed in the field by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nass</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Evidence for differential plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> at 2Â°C
          Having ascertained that at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX> and low light intensity
          foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> decreased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> as described for field grown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, we
          proceeded to gravimetrically measure plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake
          from the soil. The design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> soil system for
          measuring plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake was such that the
          possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> loss via evaporation was minimized.
          Thus reduction in weight of the system could only be
          attributed to removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the soil by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> or
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake. Mean plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake was
          determined after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          wk no significant difference was observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and FS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g H</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 OÂ·g FDW</ENAMEX> -1and 58 g H 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 OÂ·g FDW -1</ENAMEX>, respectively. Thereafter
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> remained effectively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>, whereas that by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g H</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of 6 wk</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summary</ENAMEX>, plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake occurred for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and FS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>. However over the entire <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 wk</NUMEX> water uptake
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> was greater than that by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Similar
          results were also obtained in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk study comparing
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Detection of maximum plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake by FR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> at 2Â°C
          The above findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with the greater
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake have significantly lower foliage water
          content than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> could reflect more rapid loss of
          foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, or limiting soil water
          available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> due to its rapid rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">plant</ENAMEX> water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX>. To test the latter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake was
          measured with increased initial soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content. The
          initial amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mL cylinder
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">58 mL</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A) or to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81 mL</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B) by
          increasing cylinder size and the soil mass while
          maintaining soil matric potential constant.
          The rate of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake was calculated from a
          slope of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake plotted against time in wk at
          2Â°C. From the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> mL supply the rate was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g H</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 OÂ·wk -1</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A), compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.5</NUMEX> g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 OÂ·wk</ENAMEX> -1from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 81</TIMEX> mL supply (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2B). Similarity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> suggested that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> mL was
          adequate to sustain maximum water uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
          However, the availability of more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> initially from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> mL supply resulted in a foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content
          decrease that approached that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> initially
          provided with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> mL. Thus we provided evidence that
          inadequate soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wk period was not the
          cause of the decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content.

          In order to determine whether the relationship between
          foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content reduction and plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake
          was a general phenomenon among other northern-selected

          studied. These cultivars together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> have excellent
          freeze survival records and are used as standards in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Great Plains</ENAMEX> field trials [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . Foliage

          foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content decrease in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> additional
          genotypes was similar to that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winoka</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>. As a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content decreased appreciably after
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 wk.</TIMEX>
          Results of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake are depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4A& <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water uptake</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winoka, Norstar</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rose</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> wk at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>, water
          uptake by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rose</ENAMEX> lagged slightly behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winoka and Norstar</ENAMEX>.
          However after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk water uptake by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norstar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> were
          equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winoka</ENAMEX>, all increasing appreciably compared to
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake values at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 wk</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). Plant water
          uptake by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winoka, Arapahoe</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YTO-117</ENAMEX> was compared
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> wk the amount was similar for these
          genotypes, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake being somewhat larger than
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Expt</ENAMEX>. A, based on the response of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winoka</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 wk</TIMEX>,
          the pattern of water uptake by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> was also greater,
          although more variable (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B).
          Under the laboratory conditions used in this study,
          the results of decreasing foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content with
          duration at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX> was similar to the findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nass</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Their
          studies were performed on field grown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and showed
          decreasing tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Fall</TIMEX> period.
          Fu 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] also demonstrated that
          tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content decreased during cold acclimation in
          the field or in an environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. In our study,
          decrease in foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content correlated with an
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">plant</ENAMEX> water uptake (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3& 4</ENAMEX>).
          Based on the assumption that stomata opened during the
          cold acclimation period, we believe that more effective
          water movement occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Osmotic potential difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>
          account for this phenomenon. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DeNoma et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          observed that during low non-freezing temperature in the
          field a greater decrease in crown osmotic potential
          occurred in freeze-resistant compared to more susceptible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRWW</ENAMEX> cultivars. We have obtained similar osmotic
          potential results with leaf tissue (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        From this limited survey we have demonstrated that FR
        genotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRWW</ENAMEX> have reduced foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content when
        acclimated under our laboratory conditions. We also
        demonstrated that plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake increased with time at
        2Â°C. We conclude that reduced foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northern</ENAMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRWW</ENAMEX> genotypes during extended
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acclimation</ENAMEX> is not due to impairment of root hydraulic
        conductance as proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fowler</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Rather
        a tissue water deficit occurs because uptake is inadequate
        to replenish foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> lost at this temperature.
        Our results suggest that the reduction in foliage water
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">content</ENAMEX> observed among the northern-selected genotypes is
        due to greater stomatal conductance at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control of</ENAMEX>
        stomatal aperture is complicated. Under the conditions of
        these experiments, we have ruled out the effect of
        photosynthesis since the light intensity was not at a level
        that resulted in foliage dry weight increase during the
        cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">acclimation period</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fricker</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] reported that stomata may
        close or open during cool temperatures, depending on plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. It has also been reported that blue
        light is particularly effective in opening stomata at low
        irradiances, because of a generally recognized low
        threshold response. Further, that the blue light response
        of guard cells is independent of chloroplast-driven changes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> that can also cause stomata to open [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] . Thus, at an irradiance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 Î¼mol m -2s -1during</ENAMEX> 2Â°C
        exposure, it is likely that reduction in foliage water
        content of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRWW</ENAMEX> cultivars is due to induced
        stomatal conductance resulting from blue light rather than
        from a photosynthetic response.

          Plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> were the primary genotypes
          investigated: 'Winoka' released in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
          and 'TAM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W-101</ENAMEX>' released in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . According to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Experiment Station</ENAMEX> records, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winoka</ENAMEX> (northern

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winoka</ENAMEX> was designated as

          Plant growth containers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> were grown in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">butyrate</NUMEX> cylinders with

          Measurement of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> uptake (PWU) at
          2Â°C
          Before transferring seedlings to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>, the wick
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exterior</ENAMEX> to each cylinder was removed. To further
          minimize evaporative loss, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parafilm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am Natl Can</ENAMEX>) was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snugly</ENAMEX> wrapped around the top of each cylinder and the
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">culm</ENAMEX>. Evaporated soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (ESW) was estimated
          from cylinders similarly wrapped, but with foliage
          removed just above the culm seal prior to 2Â°C
          exposure.
          The amount of soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> removed from a cylinder
          during a designated time (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) consisted of both (PWU 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) and ESW

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - ESW 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) below was the amount of water
          evaporated from a cylinder without foliage during the
          interval between t = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and a test interval t. Initial
          soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content (SW

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) were gravimetrically determined
          from cylinders with foliage removed just above the culm
          seal at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of placement at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2Â°C</TIMEX>. The difference between
          the SW 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and SW 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> reflected the amount of water taken
          up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (PWU).
          Thus,
          PWU 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = (SW 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - SW 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) - (ESW 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> - ESW 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> control cylinders (containing plants

          At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of each 2Â°C</TIMEX> treatment interval, the foliage
          of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> was excised <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 cm</NUMEX> above the soil surface.
          Foliage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> content (FWC) was determined from foliage
          fresh weight (FFW) and foliage dry weight (FDW) using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equation FWC</ENAMEX> = (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">FFW - FDW)Â·FFW -1</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDW</ENAMEX> was determined after drying the foliage 48 h at
          80Â°C. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWC</ENAMEX> was expressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g H</ENAMEX>
