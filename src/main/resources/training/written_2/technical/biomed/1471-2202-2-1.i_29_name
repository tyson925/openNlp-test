        The fly visual system is characterized by its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repetitive</ENAMEX>, retinotopic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> layered
        structures: the lamina, the medulla, the lobula and the
        lobula plate. Every layer is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
        columns each of which contains the same number and types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. In contrast to our detailed knowledge
        about the anatomy of these columnar elements, not much is
        known about their visual response <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> except for the
        large lamina monopolar cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Due to the small
        diameter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, intracellular recordings are hard
        to accomplish in most cases [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. Thus, most data
        on columnar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> arise from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-deoxy</NUMEX>-glucose activity
        staining which, however, cannot easily be assigned to
        individual cell types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. Nevertheless,
        there exists anatomical evidence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> major
        parallel processing streams in the fly optic lobes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]: the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> arise from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells R1-6</ENAMEX>,
        which are connected through lamina <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells L1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L2</ENAMEX> and
        transmedulla neurons to the lobula plate. These two
        pathways are thought to be involved in motion processing.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> receives input from retinula <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells R7</ENAMEX> and
        R8, and, by way of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamina cells L3</ENAMEX>, projects mainly to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lobula</ENAMEX>. This pathway is supposed to be involved in the
        processing of form and color.
        Amongst the best-studied cells of the fly visual system
        are the large lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs), which,
        due to their large diameter axons (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 8-10 microns</TIMEX>) are
        relatively easy to record from intracellularly. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX> also
        possess a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dendritic arbor</ENAMEX> on which they receive input
        from numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnar elements</ENAMEX> arising presumably from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulla</ENAMEX> and the lobula (for review see: [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 16</ENAMEX>] Many of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">LPTCs</ENAMEX> do not produce regular action potentials but
        rather respond to excitatory or inhibitory stimuli by a
        graded shift of membrane potential [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19, 20</TIMEX>].
        Typically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX> respond to visual motion in a
        directionally selective way: They depolarize when
        stimulated by preferred direction motion, and become
        inhibited by motion along the opposite or null direction.
        According to our current view, their direction selectivity
        is produced by the antagonistic action of local elements
        tuned to opposite directions of motion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. These input
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are thought to be only weakly selective for the
        direction of motion. The direction selectivity of the LPTCs
        is enhanced to such a high degree as it is observed in the
        electrical responses solely through the subtractive
        inhibition taking place on the dendrites of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX>.
        Evidence for this type of input arrangement comes from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacological</ENAMEX> experiments where the inhibitory input is
        blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTX</ENAMEX>. Under these conditions the preferred
        direction response is enlarged and the response to null
        direction is inverted resulting in an excitation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        However, all conclusions pertaining to the response
        properties of the input elements to the tangential cells
        are based on indirect evidence only, since, for the reasons
        outlined above, only few intracellular recordings exist
        from them.
        Another line along which to identify these input
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> could be their transmitter system. Here, the
        tangential cells have been shown physiologically to possess
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transmitter receptors</ENAMEX> on their
        dendrite: a cholinergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> with a typical nicotinic
        pharmacological profile, and a γ-aminobutyric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (GABA)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. Antibodies against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> subunit of
        nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine receptors</ENAMEX> (nAChRs) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>] and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDL</ENAMEX> subunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> allowed us to investigate
        the distribution of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the fly visual
        system.
        In the following we will present immunocytochemical data
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> staining against nAChRs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and the
        inhibitory neurotransmitter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> itself. The distribution
        of immunoreactivity in the fly visual system for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> is analyzed and the putative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacology</ENAMEX> and cell types of the motion pathway are
        discussed.

          Distribution of nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine</ENAMEX> receptor
          immunoreactivity
          We tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX>, which
          originally were generated against 
          Drosophila nAChR subunits for their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity in the blowfly 
          Calliphora erythrocephala . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were directed against ligand-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dα2</ENAMEX>) whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> was directed
          against a structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> (ARD) of the 
          Drosophila nAChR [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]
          Initial screening of α-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α-Dα2</ENAMEX> sera showed no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity in western blots when 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          Calliphora brain homogenates were
          compared (data not shown). Immunohistochemical staining
          with the α-ALS serum also failed to show immunoreactivity
          in brain cryostat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calliphora</ENAMEX> in contrast to positive
          controls made in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> with the α-ARD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody mab 3D2</ENAMEX> revealed
          multiple bands in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
          Calliphora brain homogenates at
          approx. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42-50</NUMEX> kD (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). These are thought to
          correspond to the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> subunit, which migrates at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> kD in denaturing gels, and some proteolytic
          degradation products [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. In the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calliphora</ENAMEX> lane an additional band
          appeared at approx. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> kD of unknown origin. It might
          represent a hetero- or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo-dimer</ENAMEX> of the subunit or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dα3</TIMEX>, a novel α-subunit which
          migrates at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> kDa and is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross-reactivity</ENAMEX> is, however, not observed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
          Successful immunohistochemical staining with the α-ARD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in 
          Calliphora depended strongly on the
          fixation method. Fixation with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyd
          prevented positive immunoreactivity in 
          Calliphora brain tissue. In
          contrast, fixation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetic acid</ENAMEX> resulted in clear α-ARD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> in neuropilar regions of the visual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). This staining pattern could be
          attributed to the binding of the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> as
          shown by the control without the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in
          figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1c</TIMEX>. α-ARD immunoreactivity in the visual system of
          
          Calliphora was clearly restricted
          to the synaptic neuropils: the medulla, the lobula and
          the lobula plate. The inner chiasma, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> tract
          between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> neuropils, and the layer of somata
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posterior</ENAMEX> to the lobula plate did not show immunopositve
          staining for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). The medulla revealed a
          multi-layered pattern of α-ARD immunoreactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1b</ENAMEX>,
          2a), with a concentration of immunopositve signal in the
          inner medulla. The layers with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> of the
          lamina monopolar cells <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1 and L3</TIMEX> (layers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,3 and 5</NUMEX>)
          showed higher levels of immunoreactivity than the layers
          containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> of lamina monopolar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells L2</ENAMEX> and
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">photoreceptors R7</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R8</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). Especially layer 1
          showed the highest levels of α-ARD immunoreactivity in
          most of the analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. The lower level of α-ARD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in layer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoreceptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R8</ENAMEX> was not surprising as fly photoreceptors
          R1-6 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R8</ENAMEX> are known to be histaminergic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Layer 6</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R7</NUMEX> photoreceptors,
          in contrast, shows some α-ARD immunoreactivity. The
          serpentine layer, which consists mainly of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, had
          also a decreased level of α-ARD immunoreactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1b, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> layers of the inner medulla were
          highly immunoreactive. Layer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> was somewhat weaker
          stained, which might be due to a lower cell density in
          this layer compared to layers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and 9</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Layer 10</ENAMEX> contains
          the dendritic arborizations of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, which are
          presumed to represent input elements to the lobula plate
          tangential cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          Both lobula and lobula plate showed high overall α-ARD
          immunoreactivity with a less pronounced layering than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulla</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). The most posterior layer of the
          lobula, containing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell dendrites</ENAMEX>, was clearly
          distinguished from the rest of the lobula (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). T5
          cells project to the lobula plate and are thought to be
          another type of input elements to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 14</ENAMEX>]. The
          lobula plate showed high levels of α-ARD immunoreactivity
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b) whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the inner chiasma
          contained almost no immunoreactivity. The distal part of
          the lobula plate appeared to be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          immunoreactive layers which each might be further
          subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more sublayers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2bleft</ENAMEX> side).
          These layers would correspond to the functional
          representation of preferred motion direction, with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTC</ENAMEX> responding to vertical motion in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> posterior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX> sensitive to horizontal motion direction
          in the two anterior layers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 13</TIMEX>]. Several profiles of
          large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX> were visible in the lobula late. At the
          posterior edge of the lobula plate, the main dendrites of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX> cells appeared as black and round cross-sectioned
          profiles in this horizontal section (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). These
          profiles were not surrounded by α-ARD immunoreactivity on
          their side facing away from the lobula plate, suggesting
          that the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dendrites</ENAMEX> have a lower density of nAChRs
          than the higher order branches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dendrites</ENAMEX> deeper
          within the neuropile. Figure 2cgives a magnified view of
          the lobula plate with a clusters of dense α-ARD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> (arrow heads) close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX> cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dendrites</ENAMEX>. The massive presence of α-ARD immunoreactivity
          emphasizes the importance of nicotinic cholinergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotransmission</ENAMEX> in the fly visual system.
        
        
          Distribution of RDL-immunoreactivity
          The α-RDL-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is directed against the RDL-subunit
          of the 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor. In a
          previous study, this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> proved useful for the
          demonstration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA receptors</ENAMEX> in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Drosophila</ENAMEX> central nervous system [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity of the serum could also be shown
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA receptors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushroom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of the
          blowfly, 
          Calliphora erythrocephala [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. In
          the present study, we were also able to identify
          significant α-RDL-immunoreactivity in the visual system
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calliphora</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3a</ENAMEX>,c) when
          compared with control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3b</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>; α-RDL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody preabsorbed</ENAMEX> with fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>).
          α-RDL-immunoreactivity was present in a layered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in the medulla and the posterior lobula
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). Labeling in the lobula plate was more evenly
          distributed. Compared to the α-ARD-immunoreactivity, the
          α-RDL- immunoreactivity was not restricted only to
          neuropilar regions, but could also be found in perikarya
          surrounding the neuropils (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3a</ENAMEX>, asterisks) distal to
          the medulla, posterior to the lobula plate and in the
          inner chiasma. The location of the α-RDL-immunopositive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">somata</ENAMEX> in the inner (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a) and outer chiasma (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3c,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrows</ENAMEX>) as well as the layered distribution of
          α-RDL-immunoreactivity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the medulla</TIMEX> matches well with
          medulla amacrine cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], neurons that interconnect
          multiple columns in one layer.
          The most prominently labeled layer in the medulla was
          L1. In this layer, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> tangential neurons
          are found (see below), as well as the presumably
          GABAergic centrifugal C2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. In addition to
          L1, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more strata <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">weakly</ENAMEX> labeled in the
          outer medulla: a very thin portion of layer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L3</ENAMEX> and
          perhaps the proximal layer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1</TIMEX>. The posterior layers of
          the lobula showed a similar pattern for
          α-RDL-immunoreactivity as they do for
          α-ARD-immunoreactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a,e), including the most
          posterior layer containing the dendritic ramifications of
          T5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>. The lobula plate also showed significant
          α-RDL-labeling, although distinct layers do not appear as
          clearly as with the α-ARD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. In summary, GABA
          receptors seem to be widely present in the 
          Calliphora visual system.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the visual system
          With the data presented on the distribution of GABA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the visual system of 
          Calliphora , we were interested in
          the corresponding distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> neurons.
          Although detailed accounts on GABA immunohistochemistry
          already exist in the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 35, 36, 37</TIMEX>], we
          wanted to make direct comparisons in our tissue material.
          Furthermore, some uncertainty remained in the studies
          cited above about the identity of columnar GABAergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, namely <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], connecting the medulla
          with the lobula and lobula plate.
          The monoclonal GABA antiserum, which we used, produced
          a staining pattern, that was very similar to the results
          published in previous studies on the visual system of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>- and blowflies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36, 37</TIMEX>], indicating a specific
          binding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. In particular we confirmed the
          GABA-immunoreactive somata of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">putative C2 cells</ENAMEX>, fine
          GABA-positive profiles in the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX>-dendrites,
          and a bundle of large GABA-positive axons at the proximal
          border of the lobula plate which were interpreted before
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">axons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were found in all neuropils of the
          visual system. In the medulla several layers (distal and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proximal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L3</TIMEX>) contained GABA immunoreactive tangential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a). The arrowheads in figure
          4aindicate profiles of such tangential neurons that are
          shown in figure 4bin a whole mount preparation of the
          distal medulla. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> immunoreactive somata in the
          inner chiasma probably correspond to the centrifugal C2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. There were also a few GABA immunoreactive somata
          in the soma cluster posterior to the lobula plate. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> immunoreactive somata could be observed
          in the distal part of this area between the distal tip of
          the lobula plate and the medulla (data not shown).
          The lobula plate contained a high density of fine GABA
          immunoreactive profiles, especially in the anterior part.
          The main dendrites of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX> cells were surrounded and
          contacted by many of these GABA immunoreactive profiles
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a).
          The inner chiasma contained GABA immunoreactive fibers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4a,c). The horizontal section of the inner chiasma
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4cshows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> fascicles
          containing thick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> immunoreactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. Although
          observed before [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] the projection of these fascicles
          has not been described so far. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of
          these columnar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber fascicles</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> type - denoted
          here as type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - projects directly from the medulla into
          the lobula plate. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type (type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) of fascicles
          contained <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> of columnar neurons projecting from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulla</ENAMEX> to the lobula. Figure 4dillustrates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two</TIMEX>
          types of fascicles in a frontal section from the
          posterior part of the brain at the level of the lobula
          plate. Type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> fascicles, which run parallel to the plane
          of section at this location, project from the posterior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulla</ENAMEX> to the distal lobula plate. Type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fascicles from
          the same part of the medulla run orthogonal to the plane
          of section to connect to the retinotopically
          corresponding part of the lobula and appear as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-sectioned profiles. From this section it is clear
          that only type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fascicles contained GABA immunoreactive
          profiles. Thus, the pathway between medulla and lobula
          contained GABAergic elements, while the pathway between
          the medulla and the lobula plate most likely did not.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4edepicts a thick axonal element in type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fascicles
          almost in full length in the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chiasma</ENAMEX> connecting the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulla</ENAMEX> and the lobula. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]
          these thick axon profiles presumably represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-cells.
          However, we were unable to positively identify any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bifurcations</ENAMEX> in these axons projecting to the lobula
          plate. Although the fiber in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4cseemed</NUMEX> to have a
          side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>, close inspection revealed that this branch
          originates from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> in a different fascicle. Figure
          4dshows the large profile of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTC</ENAMEX> probably of an HS
          cell. As seen for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell dendrites</ENAMEX> in figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4a</TIMEX>,
          this profile apparently had contacts to fine GABA
          immunoreactive blebs, too.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nicotinic receptors</ENAMEX>
          Our staining pattern for nicotinic acetylcholine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> as demonstrated with the α-ARD antibody
          resembles very closely the pattern observed originally in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Before the
          availability of antibodies against nicotinic
          acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dipteran flies</ENAMEX>, cholinergic
          pathways have been analyzed by more indirect methods,
          mainly by immunocytochemistry against choline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetyltransferase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChAT</ENAMEX>), an enzyme of the acetylcholine
          metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>] or autoradiography of
          125I-α-bungarotoxin binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> subunit
          was shown to be associated with a distinct class of
          α-bungarotoxin binding sites in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila CNS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. ChAT-positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> would act complementarily as input elements of
          α-ARD immunoreactive elements. However, because of the
          wide abundance of acetylcholine in the insect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, it is
          likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ChAT</ENAMEX>-positive neurons also possess nAChRs. In
          fact, the distribution patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChAT</ENAMEX> in the lobula
          plate, the lobula and the inner medulla are virtually
          identical with the pattern we observed with the α-ARD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. In the outer medulla most layers match for the
          pattern of immunoreactivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ChAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> with
          exception of the terminal layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L2</ENAMEX> lamina monopolar
          cells, which shows no α-ARD immunoreactivity but is
          reported to be ChAT immunopositive in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. In accordance
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> data there is also no labeling with
          125I-α-bungarotoxin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L2</TIMEX> layer of the 
          Drosophila medulla [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. It should
          be noted, however, that layer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> in the medulla with the
          dendrites of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and the posterior layer of the
          lobula with the dendrites of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> are slightly
          weaker in their α-ARD immunoreactivity than their
          adjacent neuropil layers. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ChAT</ENAMEX>-labeling
          in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> layers is much more intensive than that of
          the adjacent layers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
          The dense α-ARD labeling in the lobula plate did not
          allow the mapping of nAChRs to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX>. However,
          the concentration of α-ARD immunoreactivity in the region
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VS</ENAMEX> cell dendrites at the posterior border of the
          lobula plate is in accordance with our earlier findings
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nicotinic</ENAMEX> receptor responses in these neurons [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA receptors</ENAMEX> and GABAergic
          neurons
          In our study, the strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA</ENAMEX> receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> is in layer 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>) of the medulla. The
          most likely columnar GABAergic element in this layer is
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have a
          presumably centrifugal projection back to the lamina and
          also arborizations in the medulla layers 5 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and 10</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T4</NUMEX>). We found α-RDL immunoreactivity in all these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layers</ENAMEX>, however, to a lesser extent than in layer 1.
          Another possible source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> in the outer medulla are
          cells that form horizontal connections between columns:
          GABA positive tangential neurons, which are also found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">layer 1</ENAMEX>, and amacrine cells, which spread multiple
          columns. The location of the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of deep medulla
          amacrine cells matches with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> immunoreactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">somata</ENAMEX> in the inner chiasma. The stratification patterns
          of these amacrine cells in turn matches with the α-RDL
          immunoreactivity pattern in the medulla. GABAergic
          medulla tangential and amacrine cells are of special
          interest for considerations of cross-column inhibitory
          interactions in the processing of visual motion
          information (see below).
          As outlined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, lobula plate tangential cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX>) respond to cholinergic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> stimulation.
          Our work and that of others show the presence of
          GABAergic profiles in the direct vicinity of LPTC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dendrites</ENAMEX>. However, the identity of the columnar
          GABAergic cell types providing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> input to LPTCs
          remains still elusive. So far, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-cells were assumed to be
          the most likely columnar GABAergic cell type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 37</TIMEX>].
          These statements, however, have to be evaluated with some
          caution because neither of these references presents
          direct evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic Y</ENAMEX>-cells. In 
          Drosophila , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-cells are
          characterized by thick <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], which is in
          accordance with our observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> immunoreactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the inner chiasma. However, we were not able to
          identify any bifurcated GABA immunoreactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, as
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would expect in the case of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-cells. T4 cells, which
          are direct columnar input elements to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>],
          are unlikely to be GABAergic because the fascicles
          connecting directly between medulla and lobula plate did
          not contain any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> immunoreactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. The other
          columnar cell type that is most likely to provide input
          to LPTCs are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T5</NUMEX> cells originating in the lobula [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          From our results we cannot eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T5 cells</ENAMEX> as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> inputs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>-cells
          though also remain likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Possible role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> in motion detection
          In the original model of motion detection, direction
          selectivity was proposed to arise in several consecutive
          processing stages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44</TIMEX>]: In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, the
          retinal luminance levels of adjacent photoreceptors
          interact with each other in a nonlinear way after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
          them is temporally low-pass filtered. This process is
          repeated in mirror symmetrical fashion. In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step,
          the output signals of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> become subtracted
          from each other. Finally, the outputs from all these
          local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are spatially pooled to result in a
          directionally selective wide field response. With respect
          to our present picture of the cellular implementation,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> processing step is thought to be
          realized on the dendrites of the lobula plate tangential
          cells, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of motion detection, i.e. the
          nonlinear interaction, probably takes place in small
          columnar neurons of the medulla and/or lobula.
          The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA receptors</ENAMEX> in layers of the
          medulla that take part in motion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> argue for a
          role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> transmission in the input pathway of
          lobula plate tangential cells. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> seems not
          only to play a role in the subtraction stage of the
          motion detection process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>] but is probably also
          involved in the nonlinear interaction between neighboring
          retinal locations. In model simulations, such a
          nonlinearity was accomplished by e.g. a multiplication [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>] or a logical AND NOT gate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. As has been shown
          such a computational task could be implemented at the
          cellular level by shunting inhibition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Comparison of immunostaining with activity-labeling
          studies in Drososphila
          Our understanding of motion processing on the cellular
          level in the medulla is, compared to the lobula plate,
          very incomplete. In particular the location and
          implementation of the nonlinear multiplicative
          interaction between the input <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> remains elusive as
          outlined above. Few attempts have been made to resolve
          this problem with intracellular recordings from medulla
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. Another approach that has been
          taken was to label the activity in neuropils by means of
          3H-deoxyglucose [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Visual motion stimuli, i.e.
          rotating bars around the fly, lead to a characteristic
          labeling pattern in the medulla. Under these conditions,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">layers 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L2</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L1</NUMEX>) showed increased
          3H-deoxyglucose uptake. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Layers 9</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the proximal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medulla</ENAMEX> also were radioactively labeled [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This
          demonstrates the participation of these layers in the
          transmission of relevant information for the processing
          of visual motion. Comparing this to our results from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholinergic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABAergic</ENAMEX> receptor immunocytochemistry,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> pathway (layers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 5</NUMEX>) is the most likely to
          carry the relevant input signal for the non-linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> through the medulla.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Putative</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of the fly motion
          pathway
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> studies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were proposed
          to constitute the elementary motion detector of the fly
          visual system: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T4- and the T5</TIMEX> cells, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> also
          called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'bushy T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 14, 15</ENAMEX>]. The reason why
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are so suggestive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> is that i) both
          of these cells come in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> different subtypes, each of
          which ramifies in a different layer of the lobula plate [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) 3H-deoxyglucose measurements using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX>
          directions of motion (up, down, left, right) revealed a
          specific staining pattern of exactly these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> layers in
          the lobula plate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX> occupy with
          their large dendrites preferentially those layers in the
          lobula plate, which correspond to these different
          directions of motion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, a direct
          synaptic contact has been demonstrated at the EM level
          between a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T4</NUMEX>-cell and the dendrite of an HS-cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
          Taken the available immunocytochemical evidence presented
          in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> together with what is known about the
          anatomy of columnar elements and the physiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTCs</ENAMEX>,
          the following picture about the cellular implementation
          of motion detection in the fly visual system can be drawn
          in the most parsimonious way: The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> major step of
          motion detection, i.e. the non-linear interaction between
          input channels, is realized on the dendrites of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T4</NUMEX>-cells
          and the input elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T5 cells</ENAMEX> in the proximal layer
          of the medulla by a combined cholinergic-GABAergic
          mechanism. This results in weakly directional signals for
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal directions</ENAMEX> of motion split into
          a cholinergic pathway, providing direct excitatory input
          onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTC</ENAMEX> dendrites through <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T4</NUMEX>-cells, and an indirect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> pathway, relayed through the posterior layer of
          the lobula via T5-cells, providing inhibitory input to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTC</ENAMEX> dendrites. Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step in the computation
          of direction selectivity, i.e. the subtraction, is
          mediated by the opponent interaction between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T4</NUMEX>- and T5
          cell input on the dendrites of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTC</ENAMEX>. Finally, these
          signals become integrated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPTC</ENAMEX> dendrite. At
          present, this proposal, is highly speculative, but may
          proof useful to be challenged in the future by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiological</ENAMEX> or optical recordings from several
          of the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of the motion detection
          circuit.
        
      
      
        Material and Methods
        
          Antibodies
          We used several different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to map the
          distribution of nAChRs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and GABAergic
          neurons respectively. The monoclonal α-ARD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> mab
          3D2 was raised against a structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> of the nAChR
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. In the 
          Drosophila nervous system <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mab</ENAMEX> 3D2
          produces exactly the same staining pattern as that
          observed with polyclonal antisera against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARD</ENAMEX> nAChR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. We also used the monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> α-ALS
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mab D4</ENAMEX>) and a polyclonal serum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">α-Dα2</ENAMEX>, both directed
          against α-like ligand-binding subunits of the 
          Drosophila nAChR [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 28</TIMEX>]. The
          polyclonal α-RDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is directed against a 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GABA receptor subunit</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>]. To detect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABAergic</ENAMEX> neurons we used a commercially
          available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibody</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affinity</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Products Ltd.</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GA 1160</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Exeter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Western blot
          Western blotting was used to demonstrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity of the α-ARD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with 
          Calliphora nAChR subunits. For the
          preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane proteins</ENAMEX>, brains from 
          Calliphora erythrocephala and heads
          of 
          Drosophila melanogaster were used.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 30-35</NUMEX> 
          Calliphora brains were dissected
          under ice-cold saline and immediately frozen with liquid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX>. Similarly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were collected
          under ice-cold saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> μl
          of 2x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laemmli</ENAMEX> buffer with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8 M Urea</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>] was added per
          brain or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, respectively. Brains and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">homogenized 3 × 20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sec</ENAMEX> with a sonicator (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX>). Tubes
          were cooled on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> s between homogenizations. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogenate</ENAMEX> then was boiled for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min at 100°C</NUMEX> and debris
          was removed by centrifugation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15000</NUMEX> rpm.
          Supernatant was divided into aliquots of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 μl</NUMEX> and stored
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX> until further processing. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels were
          prepared with a minislab gel system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBK</ENAMEX> Midget
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gelsystem</ENAMEX>). Up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μl</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane protein</ENAMEX> preparation
          per lane were loaded onto the gel. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS-PAGED</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (PVDF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immobilon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P Ø 0.45 μm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore</ENAMEX>). Immunglobulin binding

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 h at</TIMEX> and then washed again <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> × <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>. Antibody binding was visualized by
          enhanced chemiluminescence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham</ENAMEX>) according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> directions.
        
        
          Immunocytochemistry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibody stainings</ENAMEX> were performed on cryostat sections
          of 
          Calliphora erythrocephala . 
          Drosophila melanogaster (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> WT)
          was used as a positive control for immunoreactivity of
          the mab <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3D2 α-ARD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. 
          Calliphora brains were removed from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> capsule under <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold standard fly saline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]
          and fixed immediately in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> (Formaldehyd <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3,7%</NUMEX>, ethanol

          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> sucrose for cryoprotection <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> immunocytochemistry 
          Calliphora brains were fixed for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4 h</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> glutaraldehyde in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer (pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>). 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were harvested and
          prepared according to a slightly modified protocol
          described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchner et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> were
          attached with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and thorax to a small plastic stick
          and submerged into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold 
          Drosophila saline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proboscis</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ventral</ENAMEX> air sacs were removed to allow quick access of
          the fixative. Heads were put into <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyd for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4 h</ENAMEX> for fixation. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were washed in 
          Drosophila saline with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> sucrose
          and left there <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> after changing the saline
          once.
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-23 μm</NUMEX> thick sections of 
          Calliphora brains and 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were cut on a
          cryostat microtome (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2800</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frigocut, Reichert-Jung</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuβloch</ENAMEX>). Sections were allowed to warm up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> and
          washed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X100</ENAMEX>. Sections
          were blocked depending on the secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with
          either <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> bovine serum albumine (BSA), or horse serum
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vectastain Elite Kit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> to prevent
          unspecific binding. The primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was diluted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0,1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX> or optionally in addition with the

          incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. Immunoreactivity of the
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was then labeled either with the
          chromogen diamino benzidine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO Diagnostika</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>)
          or with a fluorophore-coupled secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          For labeling of immunoreactivity with the

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, CA) was used according
          to the suggested protocol. Sections incubated with the
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> were allowed to warm up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> min
          and then were washed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 × 15 min</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>.
          Sections were incubated with the secondary antibody
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">biotinylated</NUMEX> horse anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 - 1½ h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>.
          After washing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 × 15 min</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>, slides

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">avidin-peroxidase-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 - 1½ h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>. Again
          sections were washed twice for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> before they were
          preincubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. DAB-solution was
          exchanged before reacting the section with

          Reaction was stopped by several changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and
          sections were washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Alternatively,
          immunoreactivity of nAChR was labeled with a

          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cy5</NUMEX>) coupled fluorescent secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Sections
          for fluorescent labeling also were allowed to warm up to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 1 h</TIMEX> and washed twice for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> min with
