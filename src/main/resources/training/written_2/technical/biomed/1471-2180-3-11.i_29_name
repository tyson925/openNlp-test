        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> are important pathogens in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Their short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> time and high mutation
        rates allow them to adapt rapidly to changing environmental
        conditions, and make them ever-changing targets for
        anti-viral therapies or vaccinations. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> viruses form
        highly polymorphic clouds of mutants, so-called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispecies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . At viral loads of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 8or more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virions</ENAMEX> in an infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, viral quasispecies 
        in vivo often contain all possible
        single-point mutants from the consensus sequence, as well
        as a sizeable fraction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">or three</NUMEX>-point mutants [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        . Besides their importance as pathogens, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> have
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> also become one of the main tools for
        experimental verification of theoretical population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX> and evolutionary theory in general (reviewed in [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] ). This line of research can draw on a substantial body
        of literature on the theory of quasispecies dynamics and
        its relation to standard population genetics [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        The quasispecies theory has been useful to understand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> virus evolution, but the assumptions underlying the
        model do not always reflect the biology of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX>. In
        some instances the original model has been corrected to
        account for discrepancies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infinite</ENAMEX> vs. finite
        population sizes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9 16</NUMEX> ] . However, other factors need
        to be considered as well. For instance, the standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispecies</ENAMEX> model assumes low multiplicity of infection
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>), that is, each cell is assumed to be infected by
        at most one virion. At high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, when several virions
        coinfect a single cell, the virions can recombine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] or reassort (for segmented viruses) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the model assumes that the genotype of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virion</ENAMEX> fully determines its fitness. However, this
        assumption is not always justified, since many viral
        functions can be provided in trans - an effect referred to
        as complementation. Thus, the phenotype of a virion may not
        reflect its genotype [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . Phenotypic mixing
        and hiding is a particular case of complementation
        involving surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (above citations). It occurs
        either at high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> different mutants
        or virus strains freely exchange genetic sequences and
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> inside a cell, or at low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, when a
        mutant offspring is encapsidated by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        No general theory is available for the evolutionary
        dynamic of a viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quasispecies</ENAMEX> under the influence of
        virus density as it changes with changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i. However</ENAMEX>,
        some particular cases have been studied [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] ,
        mostly related to recombination and reassortment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] and to the dynamic of defective interfering particles
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we modify the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispecies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> by incorporating phenotypic hiding
        between wild-type virus and a deleterious mutant. We assume
        that the mutant differs from the wild type in a surface
        protein necessary for cell entry, so that the fitness
        difference between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">virions</ENAMEX> is solely determined by the
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and not by the particular genomes they
        carry. We show that phenotypic hiding of the mutant genome
        behind wild-type capsids increases the mutant frequency
        above the level predicted by the standard quasispecies
        model. This increase in mutant frequency is most pronounced
        at high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, but exists also at very low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>
        Moreover, we show that the decrease of mutant frequency
        from an initially high level down to the level of
        mutation-selection balance is slowed down substantially at
        high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> because of phenotypic hiding.
        We propose that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> may explain some of the
        quantitative differences observed between theoretical
        predictions of the quasispecies <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and experimental data
        published in the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44 45</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foot</ENAMEX>-and-mouth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> virus (FMDV) has been one of the
        most productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of viral quasispecies dynamics
        (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMDV</ENAMEX> belongs to the Picornaviridea
        family. It has a non-segmented, positive strand genome of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 8.5 Kb</NUMEX> encapsidated by viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VP1</TIMEX>,
        VP2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VP3 and VP4</TIMEX>. A conserved Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (RGD) triplet in Œ≤G-Œ≤H loop of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VP1</TIMEX> recognizes the
        Œ±vŒ≤3, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Œ±vŒ≤6</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Œ±vŒ≤1</NUMEX> integrin as viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (reviewed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] ), the first necessary step for virus entry.
        Work carried out with different RGD <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus mutants</ENAMEX> and mimic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50 51 52</NUMEX> ] clearly demonstrates the
        critical role that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGD</ENAMEX> triplet has in virus entry, and
        its little tolerance to variation. Among the few RGD
        mutants that have been isolated, on is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RED</ENAMEX>, a low fitness
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> in which the glycine is replace by glutamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ru√≠z-Jarabo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> found that after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revertant RGD</ENAMEX> genomes became dominant, and mutant genomes
        were no longer detected in the consensus sequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RED</ENAMEX> was
        able to remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> for very long times and at
        surprisingly high frequencies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44 45</NUMEX> ] . There is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> agreement between the predictions of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispecies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and this result, but there is also a
        quantitative discrepancy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RED</ENAMEX> memory genomes can be
        observed at much higher frequency than expected. However,
        phenotypic hiding promotes a decelerated decay of mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and this decelerated decay could
        be interpreted as a memory effect, in agreement with the
        results by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ru√≠z-Jarabo et</ENAMEX> al. The research design of the
        original work [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44 45</NUMEX> ] does not allow us to
        conclusively accept or reject our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> as the correct
        explanation for their observations, but the values of
        mutant frequencies predicted by our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are consistent
        with the experimental data.
      
      
        Model
        We assume that the virus is propagated under serial
        transfer, and model the change in mutant concentrations
        from passage to passage. We assume that the difference
        between wild type and mutant lies in the capsid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        such that the mutation affects the ability of the virus to
        enter a cell, but not the viability of the virus inside the
        cell. Under phenotypic mixing and hiding, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        types of virions that can occur: wild-type genotype with
        wild-type phenotype, wild-type genotype with mutant
        phenotype, mutant genotype with wild-type phenotype, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> genotype with mutant phenotype. We will call virions
        whose genotype coincides with their phenotype as pure, and
        virions for which genotype and phenotype do not coincide as
        mixed. In the following paragraphs, we outline the
        derivation of a set of deterministic equations that
        describe the change in relative concentrations of the
        different pure and mixed virions in an infinite virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. More details are given in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Methods</ENAMEX> section.
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> studied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szathm√°ry</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX>

        by
        
        We now introduce mutations into this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. We assume
        that the wild type mutates into the mutant with probability
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Œº.</ENAMEX> For simplicity, we assume that back mutations occur at
        the same rate. (It is safe to make this assumption, because
        the rate of back mutations from deleterious to advantageous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutants</ENAMEX> tends to have little effect on mutation-selection
        balance.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutations</ENAMEX> will typically not affect the phenotype
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring virion</ENAMEX>, which is determined by the
        distribution of mutant or wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">capsid proteins</ENAMEX> in the

          Extinction of mutant for Œº = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          In order to evaluate whether the mutant can coexist
          with the wild type or will ultimately go extinct if it is
          not constantly regenerated through mutations, we have to
          analyze the fixed points of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqs</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1a</NUMEX>)-(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1d</NUMEX>). There are two
          trivial fixed points, corresponding to the cases in which
          all virions are either pure wild-type or pure mutant. We
          could not find any non-trivial fixed points. Since the
          expressions involved are extremely unwieldy, we searched
          for non-trivial fixed points only numerically (using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">function NSolve of Mathematica</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] ).
          A linear expansion around the fixed points tells us
          whether the mutant can invade an established wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or vice versa. If we introduce a small amount
          Œµ of mutant virions into an established wild-type

          amount of mutant genomes in the population decreases in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> passage, which implies that the mutant cannot
          invade. Likewise, if we introduce a small amount Œµ of
          wild-type virions into an established mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
          the total amounts of mutant and wild-type genomes after
          the next passage become to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Œµ</TIMEX>:
          
          In this case, the amount of the invading wild-type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> in the population increases, which implies that
          the wild-type can invade an established mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The invasion of a mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> by a
          small amount of wild-type virions is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
          The preceeding analysis shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eqs</ENAMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1a</NUMEX>)-(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1d</NUMEX>) have
          only a single stable fixed point, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which the
          whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> consists of pure wild-type virions. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> will therefore always go extinct eventually.
          The rate at which the mutant disappears depends on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the ratio between mutant and
          wild-type concentrations as a function of passage, for
          various <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i. Concentrations</ENAMEX> are measured with respect
          to the genotype, that is, mutant and wild-type

           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/Œ≥</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
           = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>. At low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, the mutant-to-wild-type ratio
          drops from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at passage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 -2and</NUMEX> lower
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> passages. At high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, the reduction in
          mutant concentration proceeds much slower. For example,
          at an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, the mutant-to-wild-type ratio is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 10</NUMEX> -1after four passages. An interesting aspect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2is that the reduction in mutant frequency during
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> passage is independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> This
          effect is a consequence of our assumption that the mutant
          has impaired ability of cell entry. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of
          infection, when all virions are pure wild type or pure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>, the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virions</ENAMEX> cannot benefit from phenotypic
          hiding. Therefore, their frequency will decrease
          corresponding to the true fitness difference to the wild
          type, independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> From the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> passage
          onward, the balance between pure and mixed virions is
          established, and further reduction of the mutant
          frequency is slowed down at high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the individual concentrations of the
          various pure and mixed virions at an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>. We
          observe that the concentration of pure mutant virions
          decreases much faster than that of mixed virions with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> genomes. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> passages both concentrations
          are equal, and after fifty passages, there are more than
          twice as many mixed virions with mutant genomes than
          there are pure mutant virions. When the mutant is rare,
          it is mostly hiding behind wild-type capsids, which slows
          down its extinction. Interestingly, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> genomes encapsidated with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
          equal to the fraction of wild-type genomes encapsidated
          with mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> mutation rate. This symmetry
          is a consequence of the symmetry of equations (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1b</NUMEX>) and
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1c</NUMEX>), and disappears for Œ<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">º > 0</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Mutation-selection balance for positive Œº
          We now turn to the general case of a positive mutation
          rate Œº. We first consider the case of vanishingly low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. When we set 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eq</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) becomes the
          discrete-time version of a model of maternal effects in
          quasispecies evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] , the
          fitness of a virion is assumed to be the product of a
          contribution from the genotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">virion</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">virion</ENAMEX>'s own genotype. The situation here is
          simpler, because we assume that fitness is only
          determined by the phenotype (efficiency of cell entry).
          In the language of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] , this means we have

          and mixed virions (neglecting back mutations from mutant
          to wild type):
          
          We mentioned in the previous section that

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Note, however, that this result holds only under

          increases, the mixed virions with mutant genomes will

          this relationship is reversed, and there are
          substantially more mixed than pure mutants.
          For the total amount of mutant genomes in the

          For comparison, the standard quasispecies model
          (without phenotypic hiding) predicts:
          
          This expression is equivalent to the one given by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ru√≠z-Jarabo et al.</ENAMEX> in their analysis of quasispecies
          memory [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) differ only in the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
           . This factor is larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for small mutation
          rates, that is, as long as

          If the mutant has a substantial fitness disadvantage
          in comparison to the wild type (say <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 10%</NUMEX>), then Œº
          will always be small enough to satisfy this condition.
          Therefore, phenotypic hiding will lead to an increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> genomes even at low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> The increase is at most
          a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Œº << 1</ENAMEX> and Œ≥

          standard quasispecies model.
          For the case of positive mutation rate and high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, there is no analytic solution available, and we
          have to resort to numerical simulations. Figure 4shows
          the decay of mutant genomes over time, starting from an
          initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where mutant and wild type are present in
          equal concentrations. We have displayed trajectories for
          a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, and we have also displayed the
          corresponding trajectory generated by the standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispecies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. All trajectories show the same
          qualitative behavior: The mutant frequency decays quickly
          during the initial passages, and then levels off in
          mutation-selection balance. As discussed in the previous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paragraphs</ENAMEX>, the level of mutant genomes in
          mutation-selection balance is always higher in our model
          than in the standard quasispecies model. Moreover, the
          level of mutant genomes increases with increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>
          The initial decay of mutant genomes is also influenced by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, and slows down with increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i. In</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, the initial decay of mutant genomes for Œ<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">º > 0</ENAMEX>
          is identical to the one for Œº = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, as described in the
          previous subsection. It is interesting to note that
          phenotypic hiding influences the equilibrium
          concentration of mutant genomes at low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, but not
          the speed at which equilibrium is attained. The initial
          decay of mutant genomes is identical for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> at low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> and for the standard quasispecies model.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ru√≠z-Jarabo et</ENAMEX> al. measured the frequency of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minority FMDV RED</ENAMEX> mutant up to passage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>, and found that
        the frequency was still declining at passage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
        They observed mutant frequencies at passage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 between 6.6</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√ó 10 -4and 10 -3.</ENAMEX> These results are in agreement with our
        model of phenotypic hiding if we use a relative fitness of
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RED mutant</ENAMEX> as compared to the wild type [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 44</NUMEX>
        ] , and assume that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the fitness disadvantage is fully
        explained by impaired entry, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the mutation rate is Œº =
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately five</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between one and five</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ru√≠z-Jarabo et al.</ENAMEX> noted that mutant concentrations around
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -3would follow from equilibrium state of the standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quasispecies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> if the mutation rate were Œº = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        -3rather <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Œº</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>. However, the standard quasispecies
        model predicts that the mutation-selection balance should
        be reached around passage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), which is at odds
        with the observation that the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RED</ENAMEX> mutants
        continued to decline up to passage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>.
        It is important to note that capsid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be
        provided in trans during the production of infectious FMDV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , and phenotypic hiding has been known for
        many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">picornaviruses</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57 58</NUMEX> ] .
        Other factors may enhance or reduce the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX>. For instance, compartimentalization or
        physical localization should prevent to some degree the
        free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of genomes and products.
        In order to test fully the predictions of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we
        would need data on the decay of the mutant frequency from
        replicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations propagated</ENAMEX> at different <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>
        Unfortunately, such data does not exist. Although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ru√≠z-Jarabo et al.</ENAMEX> propagated their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> at an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> in their initial study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] and at an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and five</NUMEX> in their follow-up study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ]
        , we cannot compare the mutant frequencies reported in
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies, because the method of screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RED</ENAMEX>
        mutants was changed in the follow-up study ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, Note b). Moreover, a caveat applies to the comparison of
        the experimental data to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ru√≠z-Jarabo et</ENAMEX> al.
        determined the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RED mutants</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> screening
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SD6</ENAMEX>) resistant virions, and
        then determining the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RED mutants</ENAMEX> among them
        from sequence data. While this method successfully prevents
        against counting MAb-resistant mutants that are not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RED</ENAMEX>, it
        does not measure the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RED mutants</ENAMEX> that hide
        behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGD</ENAMEX> capsids. If phenotypic hiding plays an important
        role in this system, then the fraction of hiding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RED</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> could be substantial, and the reported mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> would likely represent underestimates. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summary</ENAMEX>, the experimental data are consistent with our
        model, but do not allow us to either accept or reject it
        with certainty. We have shown in the present paper that
        phenotypic hiding can increase equilibrium frequencies by
        factors of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to five</NUMEX>, or even higher, for high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i. It</ENAMEX>
        is conceivable that other types of complementation can have
        similar effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] .
        Phenotypic hiding can bias fitness determinations if the
        phenotype, rather than the genotype, is quantified. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> occurs simply because a fraction of mutant genomes
        will hide behind wild-type envelopes and will be missed, an
        effect that has been previously reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 60</NUMEX> ] . As a
        byproduct of our study, we predict <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phases of mutant
        frequency decay specific to phenotypic hiding. In the first
        round of infection, all virions are pure wild type or pure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>, so that the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virions</ENAMEX> cannot benefit from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complementation</ENAMEX>. Therefore, their frequency will decrease
        corresponding to their true fitness and independently of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> From the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> passage onward, the balance
        between pure and mixed virions is established, and further
        reduction of the mutant frequency proceeds much slower if
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> is sufficiently high, as illustrated in Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. As a consequence, if fitness competitions are halted
        after the first passage, measurements of the phenotype will
        not bias fitness determinations. These effect should not be
        observed in other forms of complementation, but should be
        characteristic of any situation in which the phenotype is
        determined by envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Host</ENAMEX> range will often
        belong to this category, since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> recognition is one
        of its main determinants. Other examples include antibody
        resistant mutants and escape mutants when the antiviral
        drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> entry, such as rimantidine and
        amantidine-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> strains or WIN
        compound-resistant picornaviruses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . Thus, phenotypic
        hiding can keep a relatively large frequency of mutants in
        the absence of selective pressure that can provide a quick
        response when such selective pressure is restored.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complementation</ENAMEX> can also complicate the interpretation
        of other experimental results involving competition between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (or more) strains. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miralles et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> ] tested the effect of clonal interference in VSV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> by changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> size in competitions
        between wild type and a MARM mutant. This MARM mutant
        carries a point mutation that confers resistance to I1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mab</ENAMEX>,
        but it is neutral otherwise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . Clonal interference
        occurs in asexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> sizes are large
        enough to allow the simultaneous generation of more than
        one advantageous mutation, so that the best mutation has to
        compete not only with an inferior wild type but also with
        the other fitter mutants [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . Thus, while the best
        possible mutation should always be the one becoming
        dominant, the rate at which it does so should be slowed
        down in large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The VSV competition experiments
        were carried out at increasing viral population sizes, but
        the number of infected cells was held constant, that is,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> was increased alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> size.
        Therefore, complementation may also have contributed to the
        slowdown of the speed of adaptation at large population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sizes</ENAMEX>, and the relative contributions of complementation
        and clonal interference to the slowdown would be hard to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disentangle</ENAMEX>. The only phenotypic hiding effect that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> could avoid were related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
        changes in MARM C frequencies, and these only correlate to
        the changes in beneficial mutation frequencies if the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> mutation mapped to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> glycoprotein.
        Many infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are probably
        initiated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or few viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX>, thus corresponding
        to a situation of low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX> As replication proceeds and
        titers rise, the likelyhood of coinfection increases. The
        best evidence for multiple infections 
        in vivo comes from the observation of
        natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinants</ENAMEX>. In the case of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>, for instance,
        rampant recombination has been reported, even among
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtypes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 67</NUMEX> ] , and the number of proviruses
        per cell was estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately three</NUMEX>. Another
        well known example is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> virus, for which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reassortment</ENAMEX> is a major mechanism of evolutionary change [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> ] . As in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, reassortment depends of
        coinfection, and once coinfection occurs, complementation
        is as likely to ensue as reassortment.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that phenotypic hiding has substantial
        influence on the equilibrium frequencies of mutants in
        selection-mutation balance, and on the speed at which
        deleterious mutants are lost from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Our
        theory makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> predictions that can be tested
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">experimentally:</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The rate at which the mutant disappears should
        decrease and the equilibrium concentration of the mutant
        should increase with increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. A substantial fraction of mutant genomes should be
        encapsidated with wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The ratio of mutant genomes encapsidated in wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to wild-type genomes encapsidated in mutant protein
        should decrease with increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Even at low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, the fraction of mutant present in
        mutation-selection balance should be larger (up to a factor
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) than predicted by the standard quasispecies model
        if the mutant fitness is low compared to the wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitness</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The decrease of mutant frequency during the first
        passage should be independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>, and equal to
        that measured for later passages at very low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m.o.i.</ENAMEX>
        Future experiments can be designed to test these
        predictions, and can thereby clarify whether phenotypic
        hiding is a major contributor to viral memory and elevated
        equilibrium frequencies of mutants.
      
      
        Methods
        In this section, we present some calculations that form
        the basis of the derivation of our model equations.
        We first calculate the probability that a virion
        produced by an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> -fold coinfected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is pure.
        Assume a cell is infected by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k virions</ENAMEX> with wild-type genotype,
        and by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k virions</ENAMEX> with mutant genotype. Then,
        the probability that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring virion</ENAMEX> is pure wild-type
        is the probability that it has wild-type genotype, which is
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , times the probability that it has
        wild-type phenotype, which is again 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . Thus, the total probability is ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. If we want to know the
        probability that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring virion</ENAMEX> is pure for a number
        of coinfected cells with different ratios in their
        multiplicity of infection of wild-type and mutant
        genotypes, then we have to sum over the different
        contributions of all the individual cells. In practice, we
        will not know exactly which cells are infected with what
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virions</ENAMEX>. However, it is reasonable to assume that we know
        the overall probabilities with which cells are infected
        with either mutant or wild-type genotype. Assume that 
        x 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
         is the probability that a cell is infected with
        wild-type genotype, and 
        x 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 1 -</ENAMEX> 
        x 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
         likewise for the mutant genotype. Then, the number of
        wild-type genomes 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> in a cell is binomially
        distributed, and therefore the overall probability Œæ 
        
          ww 
         ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring virion</ENAMEX> from a
        cell infected by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> virions is pure wild-type becomes [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ]
        
        Likewise, we find for the probability Œæ 
        
          mm 
         ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring virion</ENAMEX> is pure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant Œ</ENAMEX>æ 
        
          mm 
         ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) = 
        x 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
         
        x 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> + .
        Now we consider mixed virions. Assume again that a cell
        is infected by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k virions</ENAMEX> with wild-type genotype,
        and by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k virions</ENAMEX> with mutant genotype. In
        analogy to the considerations for a pure virion, we find
        that the probability of a mixed virion is 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> - 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> )/ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n 2</ENAMEX>, regardless of whether the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX> is wild-type and the phenotype is mutant or vice
        versa. The probabilities Œæ 
        
          wm 
         ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) and Œæ 
        
          mw 
         ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ) that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring virion</ENAMEX> is mixed
        of either type are then
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Equations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) and (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>) are valid if all cells have
        exactly the same multiplicity of infection. However,
        infection is a Poisson process, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> will end up
        being infected by more virions than other cells. Assume
        that Œª is the multiplicity of infection of the whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Then, the probability that a single infected
        cell is infected by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k virions</ENAMEX> is 
        e -ŒªŒª 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k /</ENAMEX>[(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 -</ENAMEX> 
        e -Œª) 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> !]. The factor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - 
        e -Œªin the denominator corrects for
        the 
        e -Œªcells that will not be infected
        at all. We obtain the overall probabilities to find a pure
        or mixed offspring virion by summing over all possible
        combinations of infections, with their respective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probabilities</ENAMEX>. For example:
        
        After taking the sum, we find:
        
        p 
        
          ww 
         = + 
        cx

        where the constant

        and Œ≥ is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euler</ENAMEX> constant, Œ≥ ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">âà 0.577216</NUMEX>. Finally, by
        making use of 
        x 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 1 -</ENAMEX> 
        x 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
         ; we arrive at
        
        p

        Similarly, for a mixed virion, we find
