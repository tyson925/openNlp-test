        pre-existing vessel bed. Clinical interest in the control
        of angiogenesis arises from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct quarters. In one
        case, the goal is to block the growth of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> as a
        means to suppress and/or regress tumor growth, or to
        suppress vessel proliferation in pathologies such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> case, the objective is to induce or
        stimulate vessel growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with conditions
        characterized by insufficient blood flow, such as ischemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> and peripheral vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. The latter
        applications are the focus of this review. We discuss some
        of the recent efforts to induce new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> growth and we
        highlight challenges that have arisen regarding the means
        of delivery and efficacy of angiogenesis induction.
      
      
        Angiogenic stimuli
        
          Fibroblast growth factor
          The fibroblast growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (FGF) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> consists of
          an ever-increasing number of peptide growth factors with
          diverse cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> and biological effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Two
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, acidic fibroblast growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (FGF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX>, have a strong affinity for heparin and have
          been studied for their effects on vascular cells,
          including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.
          Extensive evidence indicates that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-1</ENAMEX> and FGF-2
          are potent angiogenic factors, providing support for
          their use as stimuli for therapeutic angiogenesis 
          in vivo . It is also important to
          note that many cell types express one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> FGF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> has been shown to have biological
          effects in a number of cell systems including induction
          of neurite outgrowth, suppression of skeletal muscle
          differentiation, induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation and
          neuroprotection, to name <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a few</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Vascular endothelial growth factor-A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A is the prototypic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a family of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secreted</ENAMEX>, homodimeric glycoproteins with endothelial
          cell-specific mitogenic activity and the ability to
          stimulate angiogenesis 
          in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A also increases
          vascular permeability, with an effect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> times more
          potent than that of the vasoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance histamine</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A was originally purified based on this property,
          and was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vascular</ENAMEX> permeability factor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VEGF-A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of polypeptides consists of a number of
          biochemically distinct isoforms (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> isoforms in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>) that are generated
          through alternative mRNA splicing of a single gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>]. The isoforms are named by the number of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          that comprise the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>; the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">isoforms</ENAMEX> include
          VEGF121, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VEGF145</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VEGF165</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VEGF189</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VEGF206</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Preclinical studies
        Current clinical trials of angiogenesis factors were
        preceded by a large number of studies using animal models
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> or peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ischemia</ENAMEX>. Early studies involved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, whereas later efforts began to
        employ gene therapy. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> early study using recombinant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single intra-arterial</NUMEX> injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500-1000 μg</ENAMEX>
        VEGF165 into rabbits with severe experimental hind limb
        ischemia increased collateral vessels, as detected by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiography</ENAMEX> and histological analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Naked plasmid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> injected directly into the skeletal muscle in a later
        study, using the same hind limb ischemia model, also
        yielded increased collateral vessels, as determined by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiography</ENAMEX> and improved perfusion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        Although such reports of increased vessel growth and
        functional improvement in response to exogenously
        administered angiogenic factors are encouraging, it is
        essential to note that animal models such as the ischemic
        hind limb model have definite limitations. Whereas the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models is acute (produced by
        surgical procedure), the ischemia that characterizes the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">human disease</ENAMEX> often arises over an extended time and occurs
        in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> atherosclerotic processes. The
        responses seen in the experimental models may thus be quite
        different in terms of the kinetics of vessel growth as well
        as the nature of the resultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>.
        In a study assessing the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A on myocardial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX> in a porcine model of progressive coronary artery
        occlusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A was delivered by osmotic pump and
        magnetic resonance mapping revealed a reduction in the size
        of the ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> and improved cardiac function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. A
        single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bolus</ENAMEX> injection was also found to produce
        significant improvements in myocardial blood flow and
        function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Myocardial ischemia in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> has also been
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX>. Delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX> via implantation of
        heparin-alginate beads led to an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> reduction in infarct
        size and improved cardiac function in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> with
        experimentally induced coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery constrictions</ENAMEX>, as
        compared with untreated controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. These studies were
        followed closely by the demonstration of gene therapy in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">porcine</ENAMEX> model of stress-induced myocardial ischemia.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Intracoronary</ENAMEX> injection of a recombinant adenovirus
        expressing another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-5</ENAMEX>,
        led to improvements in stress-induced function and blood
        flow that were maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Clinical trials
        
          Fibroblast growth factor
          In one study, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant FGF-2</ENAMEX> was administered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraoperatively</ENAMEX> to areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coronary artery</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were undergoing surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revascularization</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. Angiographic analysis revealed evidence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collateralization</ENAMEX>. Local sustained release of high dose
          (but not low dose) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX> to ischemic areas, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> during bypass surgery, led to a reduction in
          stress defect size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In a recent study involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary disease</ENAMEX>, the response to
          intravenous or intracoronary human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant FGF-2</ENAMEX> was
          monitored by single photon emission computed tomography
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPECT</ENAMEX>) imaging [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Perfusion was monitored at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> after growth factor
          administration. Analysis of global stress perfusion or
          inducible ischemia revealed a consistent and sustained
          reduction in the extent and severity of stress-inducible
          ischemia, as well as an improvement in resting perfusion
          in areas where there was a risk of ischemia.
        
        
          Vascular endothelial growth factor
          In an early phase I trial to test the safety and
          bioactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A, naked VEGF165 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was injected
          into the myocardium of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had failed
          standard therapy. SPECT imaging demonstrated reduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adenoviral</ENAMEX> delivery of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">VEGF121</NUMEX> to the
          myocardium of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by direct injection, either as
          an adjunct to coronary bypass grafting or as the sole
          therapy, led to improvement in the area injected, as
          measured by angiography; <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> was also reduced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
          Administration of recombinant VEGF121 improved function,
          as detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPECT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, this study
          revealed a dose-dependent improvement in both stress
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfusion</ENAMEX> and rest perfusion; there was an infrequent
          response in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received low dose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> and an
          improvement in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dose VEGF</ENAMEX>. In a different approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> cDNA was
          delivered via liposomes by catheter to coronary arteries
          following angioplasty [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. While this phase I safety
          trial did not show an effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A on the degree of
          coronary ischemia, it did prove that the treatment was
          well tolerated.
          It is important to note that no phase II controlled
          studies using defined and quantifiable endpoints have
          demonstrated efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis. This
          highlights the main obstacles for assessing a therapeutic
          response to angiogenesis therapy, the reliability of the
          assessment methods and the possible complications of the
          placebo effect. There is thus a critical need for more
          controlled trials and for the development of better
          defined and more quantifiable endpoints.
        
      
      
        Modes of delivery
        
          Protein therapy
          At present, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> seems to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferable</ENAMEX> to gene therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. This is mainly because
          dosage modulation in most clinical settings is far easier
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified protein</ENAMEX> than with gene therapy, which is
          hampered by the lack of a regulable expression vector.
          Although protein therapy has many advantages, there are
          nevertheless technical problems associated with protein
          administration, including optimization of purification
          and formulation of delivery for single and/or multiple
          angiogenic factors.
          Recent advances in drug delivery methods using
          bioerodible polymer matrices will allow long-term
          sustained release of the growth factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. This will
          resolve one of the major problems associated with protein
          administration; namely, the limited tissue half-life of
          the purified angiogenic factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. An important
          consideration, however, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> therapy is
          limited to secreted factors. Delivery of intracellular
          modulators for therapeutic angiogenesis, including
          transcription factors that control angiogenesis such as
          hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1α</NUMEX>), is only
          possible through gene therapy.
        
        
          Gene therapy
          Viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> have been the most commonly used means
          of gene delivery for both VEGF-A and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX>. Gene therapy
          presents an attractive alternative to purified proteins
          because it offers the possibility of sustained production
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> factors following a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
          Furthermore, tissue-specific and highly localized
          production of the therapeutic factor is possible, through
          the use of tissue-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>.
          However, a variety of issues have implications for the
          use of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> in gene therapy. Obvious potential
          concerns are the immune and inflammatory responses to
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who received VEGF121 via an
          adenoviral vector had increased levels of serum
          anti-adenoviral neutralizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, but there was no
          report on an inflammatory response in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. The use of adenovirus-mediated gene therapy in
          treating brain tumors has been reported to lead to active
          brain inflammation as well as persistent (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 3 months</TIMEX>
          after treatment) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
          The lack of regulable gene expression is another
          potential barrier. Some systems for inducible gene
          expressions have proved to be effective and safe in
          animal models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], but have not yet been tested in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Recent advances in stem cell research provide the
          possibility of combining gene therapy with 
          ex vivo gene transfer into stem
          cells for angiogenesis therapy, as will be discussed
          later. If successful, this approach may overcome most of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obstacles</ENAMEX> presented by gene therapy.
        
      
      
        Considerations for the future
        
          Interpatient variability
          It is not clear why some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> develop a
          collateral circulation sufficient to compensate for their
          ischemic vascular disease whereas others do not.
          Certainly, features such as the extent of the disease and
          the time frame over which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ischemia</ENAMEX> develops are
          contributing factors. However, other previously
          unconsidered variables appear to play important
          roles.
          Collateral vessel development, as measured by blood
          pressure, angiography, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel density</ENAMEX>, was
          significantly reduced in old (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-5 years old) versus young
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-8 months old</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], in a rabbit model of hind
          limb ischemia. Endothelial cell dysfunction and reduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A levels were the reasons suggested for the reduced
          collateral response. A subsequent study, demonstrating an
          age-dependent reduction in HIF-1α activity, provides one
          explanation for the lower VEGF-A expression in response
          to hypoxia in aged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. A reduced response to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoxia</ENAMEX> might translate into a weaker angiogenic
          response. This is supported by the fact that the extent
          of hypoxic induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A in monocytes correlates
          strongly with the presence of collateral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
          It is possible that genetic variability may also play
          a significant role in an individual's ability to generate
          collateral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in response to ischemia, as well as
          their capacity to respond to an exogenous angiogenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Not surprisingly, a recent report that assessed
          the angiogenic response in a murine corneal pocket model
          to a fixed dosage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX> in various strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          suggested that genetic backgrounds may influence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiogenic</ENAMEX> response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 10</NUMEX>-fold range of
          response to the fixed dosage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX> was observed among
          different inbred strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, suggesting that genetic
          variability may indeed play a significant role in
          determining the magnitude of angiogenic response to
          FGF-2.
        
        
          Systemic effects
          If VEGF-A delivery leads to significant circulating
          levels, as has been observed following myocardial
          transfection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>], then it may possibly
          affect angiogenesis elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. As plaque
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> might be dependent on angiogenesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>],
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> were prompted to examine the effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">VEGF-A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> on this process. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> that were
          double deficient in apolipoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> and apolipoprotein β
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection
          of VEGF165 recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 μg/kg</ENAMEX>). This led
          to significant increases in plaque area compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">untreated</ENAMEX> controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. In contrast, there has been no
          evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression, to date, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          treated with intra-arterial gene transfer of naked VEGF-A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX>. This has been delivered either to promote
          therapeutic angiogenesis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) or to accelerate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re-endothelization</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Although these
          observations suggest that human sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A may
          be lower than in animal models, it will be necessary to
          study a larger cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, with appropriate
          controls, over a longer time period to confirm this [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> has also been shown to mediate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> growth
          that characterizes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> expansion as well as the
          neovascularization that is associated with diabetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinopathy</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> is produced locally in both of
          these circumstances, it is not known whether systemic
          administration of the factor could exacerbate these
          conditions by further stimulating vessel growth.
          Selection of the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that may benefit from
          angiogenic therapy may thus have to involve screening for
          coexisting conditions that could be activated or worsened
          by exposure to proangiogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX> have all demonstrated
          systemic vascular effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGF-2</ENAMEX> have been
          shown to reduce blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner
          in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF-A</ENAMEX> has been reported to
          cause hypotension and death in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> following an
          intracoronary bolus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. Subsequent
          studies have revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> causes
          greater vasodilatation of coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> than serotonin
          or nitroglycerin, and also causes tachyphylaxis via a
          nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX>-dependent mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A
          administration to the extremities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> has also
          been associated with hypotension and edema [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. These
          side effects can be partly explained by the fact that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A is a potent vascular permeability factor.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A isoforms in angiogenesis therapy
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VEGF-A protein isoforms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> (and at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major isoforms in the mouse) have different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> and biological properties [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. It is
          therefore important to determine whether different VEGF-A
          isoforms give rise to different quality or quantity of
          vessels. Expression of the various isoforms during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is modulated both spatially and temporally [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>], and observations from gene knockout studies have
          proven that these isoforms do not have equivalent
          biological functions during vessel development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>].
          Furthermore, there is considerable variability in the
          phenotype of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in tumors expressing different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> within tumors
          expressing predominantly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the VEGF189</TIMEX> isoform, which has a
          strong heparin-binding affinity and thus is highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">localized</ENAMEX>, are much less leaky than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in tumors
          expressing the more diffusible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VEGF165</ENAMEX> and VEGF121
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. It will be interesting and important to
          determine whether these observations from experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> can help predict the results of clinical trials,
          which primarily employ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the VEGF165</TIMEX> isoform. Finally,
          since multiple VEGF-A isoforms are expressed during
          vascular development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], it will also be important to
          determine whether the use of multiple isoforms in
          angiogenesis therapy will be necessary to replicate 
          in vivo conditions.
        
      
      
        Achieving vessel stability
        The induction of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> to supply ischemic tissues
        is the primary goal of angiogenic therapy. Reaching this
        objective is, however, highly complex. Vessels formed in
        response to artificial angiogenic stimuli are prone to
        regression unless they are remodeled into mature, stable
        vessels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. Thus, as the level of knowledge regarding
        the mechanisms of vessel growth and stabilization
        increases, there is increasing concern that the simple
        application of a bolus of angiogenic factor may be
        insufficient for stable vessel formation, or may even be
        dangerous.
        Early studies involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A
        showed angiographic evidence of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> formation, but
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> did not persist and they regressed within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. It was recently reported that continuous
        delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A into murine hearts by retroviral
        transfer led to the formation of aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and
        hemangioma-like structures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the major problems
        encountered in the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> formed are
        unstable and leaky [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. It has been speculated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF-A</ENAMEX> alone may not be sufficient to form stable, mature
        vessels that are characterized by the recruitment of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perivascular</ENAMEX> mural cells, such as pericytes or smooth
        muscle cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. This process of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel maturation</ENAMEX> is
        called arteriogenesis and is arguably the ideal way to form
        stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> for therapeutic purposes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Administration of multiple factors
        Various growth factors such as angiopoietin (ang)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth
        factor-β as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A are also involved in
        arteriogenesis, and it may therefore be necessary to use
        combinations of these factors to obtain stable and mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Indeed, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ang-1</ENAMEX> are
        administered together in animal models, the resulting
        vessels are much more stable and less leaky than those that
        are induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF-A</ENAMEX> alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. Similarly,
        administration of submaximal doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ang-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>-A in a
        rabbit ischemic hind limb model led to a stronger effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resting</ENAMEX> and maximal blood flow and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">capillary</ENAMEX> formation than
        either of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Using a master switch gene
        Another approach that addresses the involvement of
        multiple factors in therapeutic angiogenesis is the use of
        a so-called 'master switch gene' of angiogenesis, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIF-1α</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]. This transcription factor can activate a
        collection of different genes that are involved in
        angiogenesis, including those encoding VEGF-A, VEGF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor 1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flt-1</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ang-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 54</TIMEX>]. It is hoped that
        using a 'master switch gene' will result in more stable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX>, because the processes by which they are formed
        would resemble more closely those of normal vessel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Stem cells in therapeutic angiogenesis
        The existence of circulating endothelial precursor (CEP)
        cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> has been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55, 56</TIMEX>]. It has also
        been demonstrated that similar precursor cells may give
        rise to both endothelial cells and perivascular mural cells
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, in an 
        in vitro model of angiogenesis,

        normal vascular development has been shown to require the
        presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45 +/c-Kit +/CD34</ENAMEX> +hematopoietic stem
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>], which are similar and may be related to adult
        CEP cells.
        It has been reported that CEP cells are able to
        participate in new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> growth in a variety of animal
        models, including the rabbit ischemic hind limb model [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inoperable coronary disease</ENAMEX>,
        increased circulating VEGF-A resulting from transfection of
        myocardium with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VEGF165</ENAMEX> cDNA led to a significant
        mobilization of CEP cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Another recent publication
        has shown that granulocyte-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> stimulating factor
        mobilized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> +cells, including endothelial cell
        precursors with phenotypic and functional characteristics
        of embryonic angioblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>]. When injected into rats
        with experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocardial infarction</ENAMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD34</NUMEX> +cells
        contributed to new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> growth, which led to decreased
        cardiomyocyte apoptosis, to reduced remodeling, and to
        improved cardiac function.
        Further studies of how CEP cells are released from bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> and to what extent they participate in postnatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiogenesis</ENAMEX> will certainly provide valuable information
        regarding the therapeutic potential of CEP cells. The
        possibility of using CEP cells, both alone and in
        combination with different angiogenic growth factors,
        represents a promising means of obtaining stable vessels.
        Finally, since the use of CEP cells would allow easy 
        ex vivo gene transfer, combining
        growth factor-induced therapeutic angiogenesis with gene
        therapy delivered via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEP</ENAMEX> should also be a promising
        approach.
      
      
        Conclusion
        As research into therapeutic angiogenesis progresses,
        new information regarding the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> remodeling
        and stability will be incorporated into treatment
        strategies. Better designed studies and clinical trials
        that consider the issues discussed, coupled with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">well-defined</ENAMEX> and quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endpoints</ENAMEX>, will facilitate
        the development of novel and effective therapeutic
        approaches for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic diseases</ENAMEX>.
