        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Celiac disease</ENAMEX> (CD) is a common, familial, autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastrointestinal disease</ENAMEX>. It is caused by sensitivity to
        the dietary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gluten</ENAMEX>, which is present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley</ENAMEX>. Symptoms include growth failure, abdominal
        pain, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous
        manifestation of CD. Complications of CD include lymphoma,
        osteoporosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, and seizures. The prevalence of CD in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and the ratio of symptomatic to
        asymptomatic cases is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 1:5 and 1:7</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Before
        the advent of serological testing for diagnosing CD, it was
        considered a rare <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.
        The clinical standard for diagnosis of CD is a small
        intestinal biopsy showing villus atrophy and resolution of
        symptoms on a gluten-free diet. However, small intestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX> is expensive, invasive, and often rejected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX>. The serological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX> endomysial antibody
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMA</ENAMEX>) test is a screening tool that has greatly facilitated
        evaluation for CD in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with suggestive symptoms and in
        high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX> EMA testing has proven to be
        greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> sensitive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX> symptomatic CD [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] and greater
        than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> specific in controls without known clinical
        disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . It is therefore an inexpensive and
        specific method of screening family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for genetic
        studies. Moreover, a recent study has identified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symptomatic</ENAMEX> EMA positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who have CD in whom
        intestinal biopsies were normal with only minor mucosal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed clinical and serological
        recovery on a gluten-free diet. They propose that
        sero-logic criteria may be more definitive in the
        diagnostic process than traditional biopsy criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        .
        CD has a strong genetic association with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> class
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II DQ2</ENAMEX> genotype composed of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the DQA1*05 and DQB1*02</TIMEX> alleles
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> alone is insufficient
        to explain the hereditary nature of the disease, and is
        estimated to explain less than half the sibling risk [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . There appears to be genetic heterogeneity,
        implying that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> additional gene is involved in
        the disease. With current analysis software, it is possible
        to map complex traits like CD, where several genetic loci
        are probably involved and the mode of inheritance is
        unclear.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step to identifying genes predisposing to CD
        is to investigate candidate genes. Likely candidates
        include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of genes involved in immune function,
        e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and immune-modulating
        genes. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes are those from associated,
        independent diseases in which there is a higher rate of CD
        than in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, e.g., other autoimmune
        diseases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> mellitus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDDM</ENAMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> may be explained by common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>(s) responsible for both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> may
        share a similar autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pathogenic</ENAMEX> mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        There have been several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> studies to localize genes
        for CD, but no significant evidence for linkage has been
        reported other than at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX>
        ] .
        In this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with CD from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, we investigated linkage to several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes
        that could play a role in the pathogenesis of CD using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> cases of CD.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Ascertainment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with CD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> cases of CD or dermatitis
          herpetiformis were ascertained through local
          gastroenterologists, gluten intolerance support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
          and advertising at local and national celiac disease
          support meetings. There was no selection of cases based
          on sex or race, although all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX>.
          None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> appear to be related. The research
          study was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Utah Health</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sciences Center Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
          ranged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age from 2 years</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>+ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Blood samples
          were collected from affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and their
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-degree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. For more distantly related cases,
          we also collected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that are
          connections between the cases. For example, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> (with different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>) and an
          affected grandparent, we would collect samples from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandchildren</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, and the grandparent. The
          breakdown of the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is shown in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Diagnostic criteria
          Medical records were obtained to confirm previous
          biopsy-proven CD or dermatitis herpetiformis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX> EMA
          testing was performed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who did not have a
          biopsy proven diagnosis of CD or dermatitis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herpetiformis</ENAMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA EMA</ENAMEX> is highly sensitive and
          specific for CD, we did not require biopsy confirmation
          for phenotype assignment.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA EMA</ENAMEX> was measured by indirect immunofluorescence
          using primate smooth muscle (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMCO Diagnostics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>) as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA EMA</ENAMEX> titers greater
          than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> were considered positive. Limiting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dilution</ENAMEX> was performed on the positive sera.
        
        
          Genotyping at short tandem repeat markers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRs</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from lymphocytes using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PureGene</ENAMEX> DNA
          isolation kits (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentra Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DQA1</ENAMEX> and DQB1
          genotypes were determined as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feolo et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . Genotyping of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">175</TIMEX> affected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, and any connecting relatives
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> was performed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> markers at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          candidate gene regions and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> markers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>. However, all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were not genotyped with all markers, because
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were collected after genotyping had been
          done for some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STRs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene regions,
          markers, and chromosomal locations are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          For all markers, amplification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ng genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a
          total reaction mix of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼l was performed according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard PCR</ENAMEX> procedures, with minor modifications to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimize</ENAMEX> product clarity. Genotyping was performed either
          using <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an ABI373</TIMEX> or radioactively using polyacrylamide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gels</ENAMEX>. Genotypic data were stored in the same database as
          all kindred and phenotype information.
        
        
          Linkage analysis methods
          Analyses were performed using dominant and recessive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> models, each with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> liability classes of either
          affected or unknown/unaffected based on diagnostic
          criteria (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, unaffected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with serology or biopsy based
          diagnosis were given a penetrance function based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease prevalence</ENAMEX>. For linkage analysis, we used the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASTLINK</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LINKAGE</ENAMEX> program [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point analysis, and the GENEHUNTER
          program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] for both parametric and non-parametric
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPL</ENAMEX>) multi-point analyses. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-point linkage in the
          presence of locus heterogeneity was assessed by the
          admixture test of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ott</ENAMEX>, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOMOG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . We used a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity LOD</ENAMEX> (HLOD) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 1.3</NUMEX> to indicate nominal
          evidence for linkage for all linkage analyses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Candidate genes</ENAMEX> were selected based on function of those
        genes (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, 
        CTLA4, and 
        CD4 ) or from loci of associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDDM</ENAMEX>). Although associated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> were
        not considered in the selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, in several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDDM</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, a CD case, his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibling</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> extended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDDM</ENAMEX>; in a second
        family, the CD case had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDDM</ENAMEX>; in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> of a CD case
        had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDDM</ENAMEX>; and in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> family, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> of a CD case
        had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDDM</ENAMEX>.
        The highest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLOD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> obtained with either
        model are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. The multipoint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLODs</ENAMEX> were
        obtained using the same model as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-point HLOD shown.
        The largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point and multi-point LOD scores were
        obtained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> region. Under the dominant model, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLOD</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.1 (Î±</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D6S426</TIMEX> (position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60.4</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cM</ENAMEX>), the multi-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLOD</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.02 (Î±</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.66</NUMEX>) (position
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">54.6 cM</NUMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPL</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.38</NUMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>)(position
        50.2cM). The estimate for the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> linked
        was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.66</NUMEX> for the multipoint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLOD</ENAMEX>, suggesting that
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are linked to an HLA
        susceptibility locus for CD. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene
        regions investigated, none of the regions had even nominal
        evidence for linkage (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HLOD > 1.3</NUMEX>) or an NPL score with p
        < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we examined linkage to a set of candidate
        genes for CD. This subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was selected based on
        genes that could be related to CD through function or an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> disease. For statistical and linkage analysis of
        complex diseases, we used general recessive and dominant
        models. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biostatisticians</ENAMEX> have suggested that
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> provide power to distinguish linkage signals
        independent of the true underlying disease mode of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inheritance</ENAMEX>, provided both dominant and recessive models
        are used [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39 40</NUMEX> ] . As expected, the highest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point
        and multipoint LOD scores were obtained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> region,
        with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLOD</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> and a multipoint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLOD</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>.
        This result replicates the known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and linkage of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> to CD [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 25 29</NUMEX> ] and demonstrates the power of the
        family resource to detect linkage in the set of candidate
        gene markers.
        We were interested in identifying non-HLA loci for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">celiac disease</ENAMEX>. We were unable to detect even nominal
        evidence for linkage at any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> investigated. For
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where we examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>, it may be
        that one marker was insufficient in order to detect linkage
        even if it existed. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes
        investigated in this study were examined previously in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Our results are in agreement with
        previous linkage and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies of CD and
        T-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRÎ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRÎ³</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRÎ²</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRÎ´</ENAMEX>), where
        they saw no evidence for linkage or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, although
        sample sizes were small [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 41</NUMEX> ] . 
        CD28 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CTLA-4</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding receptors</ENAMEX>
        that regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>lymphocyte activation, are located at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2q33</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holopainen et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] reported linkage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> to
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in a study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with CD,
        which may suggest a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> effect in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. In a case-control study, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CTLA-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">49A>G</ENAMEX>, was
        significantly associated with CD [p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX> with an odds
        ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.36</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.37</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.06</NUMEX>)] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        We did not find evidence for linkage with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CTLA-4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Genomic</ENAMEX> searches for CD have been conducted in several

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , studying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, found significant
        evidence for linkage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX>, but no evidence for linkage to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhong</ENAMEX>, except at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q26</TIMEX>, where 
        IDDM3 is localized. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greco et</ENAMEX> al.
        conducted a genome-wide search with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 sib</NUMEX> pairs, and an
        additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> pairs in regions of interest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . They
        found significant evidence for linkage at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> and nominal
        evidence for linkage on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5qter and 11</TIMEX> qter. Using an
        independent set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> sibpairs, they reported additional
        linkage evidence at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5q</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . King et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        performed a genome-wide search with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
        reported nominal evidence for linkage at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10q23.1</NUMEX> and
        16q23<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>. In a follow-up study with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King et</ENAMEX> al.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] reported heterogeneity LOD scores > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        regions, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11p11</NUMEX> previously reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhong et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . From these studies, the only region with at
        least nominal evidence for linkage, which overlapped with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> regions studied here, was at 
        IDDM3 at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15q26</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study reported
        possible evidence for linkage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reported weak
        evidence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reported no linkage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 22</NUMEX> ] .
        We were unable to detect linkage.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our significant evidence of linkage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> replicates
        the known linkage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> with CD. In our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, likely candidate genes/loci did not explain the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to CD. It may be that these genes/loci are
        not involved in CD, that we had insufficient genotyping
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX>, or that one, or a number of these genes,
        has a small effect so that we were unable to detect linkage
        with our set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. We were unable to detect linkage
        at 
        IDDM3 and at 
        CTLA4, for which positive linkages
        were previously reported. This is similar to the experience
        in most other reported studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">celiac disease</ENAMEX>.
        Non-replication of linkage results in complex diseases is
        common, and may be due to the low power of studies to
        detect genes of relatively small effect and/or to a high
        degree of genetic heterogeneity among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Larger data
        sets with more power likely are needed in order to find
        strong evidence for linkage.
