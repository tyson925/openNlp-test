        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maitotoxin</ENAMEX> (MTX), one of the most potent marine toxins
        known, is found in the "red-tide" dinoflagellate, 
        Gambierdiscus toxicus, and is
        responsible in part for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ciguatera seafood poisoning</ENAMEX>. In all
        cells examined to date, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> at subnanomolar concentrations
        causes a profound increase in cytosolic free Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration ([Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. This occurs, not by release of
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, but rather from activation of a
        ubiquitously-expressed, non-selective, Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-permeable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaNSC</ENAMEX>), present in the plasmalemma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX> activation is followed after a
        short lag by the activation or formation of large
        endogenous pores that allow organic molecules with
        molecular weights of <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da</ENAMEX> to cross the plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The activation of these pores can be
        determined experimentally by following the uptake of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethidium</ENAMEX> and propidium-based vital dyes. These dyes, of
        varying molecular weights, are normally excluded from the
        cytoplasm of intact viable cells, but gain access to the
        cell interior following pore formation where they bind to
        nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with a concomitant increase in dye
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX>. The large pores activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> have been
        referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytolytic</ENAMEX>/oncotic pores, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">COP</ENAMEX>, since their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> ultimately leads to the release of lactate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (LDH), an indication of necrotic or oncotic
        cell death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        The cell death cascade activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> is not unique to
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>. Stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2X purinergic receptors</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
        causes similar changes in cytosolic Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and vital dye
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>] suggesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> activates a cell death cascade that is physiologically
        relevant, although the exact role of either the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P2X</NUMEX>- or
        MTX-induced cascade in normal cellular biology remains
        unknown. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2X receptor</ENAMEX> it has been suggested that
        the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-permeable channels grow in size to form the
        dye-permeable pores through either aggregation of channel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> or through dilation of the existing channel pore
        structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. In support of this model
        it has been found that the kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-induced pore
        formation in HEK cells, heterologously expressing the P2X 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> receptor, appears to depend on
        molecular size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">permeating ionic species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        However, we recently showed that although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>
        activate distinct channels, the characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-
        and MTX-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COP</ENAMEX> are indistinguishable [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. These
        results suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">COP</ENAMEX> are unique
        molecular structures. The aggregation or dilation model
        make specific predictions concerning the kinetics of dye
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX>. In particular, this model predicts a delay between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> activation and dye uptake and this delay should be
        directly proportional to the molecular size of the
        permeating dye. Furthermore, if pores grow in size, dye
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> should be nonlinear with time. In contrast, if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> activation causes the formation or activation of a
        molecularly unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">COP</ENAMEX> with fixed pore dimensions, the
        delay between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> activation and dye uptake should be
        independent of molecular size, but the subsequent rate of
        dye uptake should be linear and inversely proportional to
        molecular weight. To distinguish between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>,
        the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> on [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i , vital dye uptake and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> release was
        examined in bovine aortic endothelial cells, a cell line
        particularly sensitive to the cytolytic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. The
        results of the present study are consistent with the
        activation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endogenous COP</ENAMEX> of fixed pore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>.
        The opening of large pores in the plasmalemma is
        expected to cause a dramatic change in the ionic
        concentration gradients that normally exist between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> and intracellular milieus, i.e., loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +,
        and gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Na +</ENAMEX>, Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cl</ENAMEX> -by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The
        concomitant flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> as a result of this
        ionic redistribution, will drive the cell towards the
        Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium. The change in osmotic pressure
        will produce cell swelling and ultimately membrane rupture
        and release of large macromolecules from the cytoplasm.
        This final phase in the cell death cascade can be monitored
        experimentally by measuring the release of the ubiquitous
        cytosolic enzyme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX>. The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> and the biophysical
        mechanism associated with this rather violent cellular
        event remains unknown. However, many cell types undergo
        membrane blebbing in response to changes in osmotic
        pressure. Such membrane blebbing, which may in a sense
        represent a cellular safety valve, has been reported during
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>- and MTX-induced cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 22</TIMEX>], but it is
        unclear if blebbing occurs before, during, or after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>
        formation or LDH release. In the present study, the effect
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> on vital dye uptake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> was correlated with
        changes in cell morphology using single cell fluorescence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">videomicroscopy</ENAMEX>. The videos presented demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>
        activation as indicated by vital dye uptake correlates in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with the formation of membrane blebs, and that
        membrane lysis, i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> release, is associated with
        dramatic bleb dilation.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> increases [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] iin BAECs
          Fura-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-loaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">BAECs</ENAMEX> were suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBS</ENAMEX>, placed in a
          cuvette at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>, and the response to extracellular
          application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> was recorded as a function of time
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> produced an immediate,
          concentration-dependent increase in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i . At the highest concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> examined (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 nM</NUMEX>), [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i rapidly increased within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-2 minutes</TIMEX>
          from a mean ± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> resting level of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">63 ± 4 nM</NUMEX> to an
          apparent [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i value close to fura-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> saturation. We
          previously showed that MTX-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>
          allows leakage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fura-2</ENAMEX> from human skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. Thus, the apparent saturation of the fluorescence
          ratio observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> reflects, at least in part, a
          contribution from extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fura-2</ENAMEX>. This is
          particularly true at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> times. Nonetheless, the major
          effect of increasing MTX concentration was on the rate of
          change of [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i , and the apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 0.3 nM</NUMEX> MTX. MTX
          had no effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAEC</ENAMEX> [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i in the absence of extracellular Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+(data not shown), demonstrating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> activates Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx, but does not cause the mobilization of Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. These results are similar to
          those obtained in human skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> THP-1
          monocytes, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]
          and supports the conclusion that the MTX-activated CaNSC
          is ubiquitously expressed.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activates COP</ENAMEX> in BAECs
          To evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>,
          the uptake of ethidium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w 314 Da</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YO-PRO-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w 375 Da</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POPO-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w 715 Da</ENAMEX>) was examined at various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations of MTX (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). After a short lag, MTX
          produced a biphasic, concentration-dependent increase in
          ethidium, YO-PRO, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">POPO-3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX> into the cells. The
          lag-time for a given concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> was the same
          for each dye (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2Dand 2E</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dashed lined), but the
          rate of dye uptake during the initial phase was inversely
          proportional to molecular weight. Furthermore, at the
          highest concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> examined, the uptake of
          ethidium, YO-PRO, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POPO-3</ENAMEX> during the initial phase was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D). These results suggest that the first
          phase reflects activation of a large pore (i.e.,
          activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>) that exhibits finite permeability for
          each of the dyes tested and is distinct from the CaNSC
          activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. The molecular mechanisms responsible
          for the delay between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> addition and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">COP</ENAMEX> formation
          (i.e., vital dye uptake) is unknown. The delay, which was
          also observed in fibroblasts, HEK cells, and THP-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>] suggests that there may be several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> steps between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> activation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>
          formation or that the concentration of a critical second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> must reach a threshold level before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">COP</ENAMEX> opens.
          This could explain the temperature sensitivity of vital
          dye uptake, previously noted for both MTX- [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purinergic</ENAMEX> receptor-induced [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 15</TIMEX>] vital dye uptake.
          During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase, dye uptake was all-or-nothing
          and once initiated the rate of dye uptake was independent
          of dye molecular weight, i.e., ethidium, YO-PRO, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POPO-3</ENAMEX> all enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> at the same time and at the
          same rate for each concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> examined. These
          results suggest that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of dye uptake is
          related to cytolysis.
        
        
          MTX induces LDH release
          To test the hypothesis that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of dye
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> reflects a large change in membrane permeability
          indicative of cytolysis, the uptake of ethidium and
          release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mw 140,000 Da</ENAMEX>) were compared in parallel
          experiments performed on the same batch of cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 3</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> again produced a biphasic increase in ethidium uptake
          into the cells. No LDH release was observed during the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of ethidium uptake consistent with the
          hypothesis that activation of COP occurs prior to release
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Extracellular LDH</ENAMEX> was measurable <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 minutes</TIMEX> after
          MTX addition and subsequently increased in parallel with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of ethidium uptake. These results
          suggest that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of dye uptake reflects a
          loss of membrane integrity and provides an explanation
          for the all-or-nothing uptake of ethidium, YO-PRO, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POPO-3</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> frame. Note that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX>
          of the cell associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> is released within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3 nM</NUMEX>) addition. For comparison, we previously
          reported that treatment of human skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM MTX caused release of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of
          cell-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> are particularly
          sensitive to the cytolytic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> produces similar changes in dye uptake in
          single BAECs
          The ethidium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uptake</ENAMEX> experiments shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Figs.</ENAMEX> 2and
          3reflect the average response of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> within the cuvette. It is possible that the
          biphasic kinetics observed reflects, at least in part,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> within the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. To test this
          hypothesis, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> was examined at the single
          cell level using fluorescence microscopy (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>). BAECs
          were sparsely seeded on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass coverslips</ENAMEX> and mounted on
          the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epifluorescence</ENAMEX> in each cell was measured using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX>
          camera and image analysis software. The uptake of
          ethidium by single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX>, as indicated by the change in
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell fluorescence</ENAMEX>, was biphasic (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 4</ENAMEX>). The rate
          of ethidium uptake during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase was
          concentration-dependent, but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase appeared to
          be all-or-nothing as was seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuvette</ENAMEX> experiments.
          Likewise, the delay between addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of ethidium uptake, although variable from
          cell to cell, was concentration-dependent. Thus, the
          overall profile observed at the single cell level
          recapitulated the results obtained in the population
          experiments. One interesting difference between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cuvette</ENAMEX> and single cell experiments is the time at which
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase begins. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>, the second
          phase of dye uptake started <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 5 minutes</TIMEX> after
          addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. At the single cell level, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase is clearly delayed and on average begins
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 10-12 minutes</TIMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM MTX addition (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          3D). Although we do not know the reason for this
          difference, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studies were performed on
          dispersed cells in a cuvette whereas, the single cell
          studies were performed on BAECs attached to glass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coverslips</ENAMEX>. Thus, adherent cells may be resistant to the
          gross changes in membrane structure that occurs during
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of the response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>.
          Previous studies suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-induced pores in
          HEK cells heterologously expressing the P2X 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purinergic</ENAMEX> receptor, were formed
          either by dilation of the channel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or by
          aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels subunits</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. However, these
          studies relied on shifts in the reversal potential of
          whole-cell membrane currents. Although this is a
          sensitive technique for determining the time course of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pore</ENAMEX> formation, these experiments do not eliminate the
          possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P2X</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> are separate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>. In the present study, the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> on
          membrane permeability occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct phases.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase reflects the activation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaNSC</ENAMEX> and a
          large and rapid increase in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i . After a short lag, the activation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COP</ENAMEX> allowed uptake of vital dyes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and the
          lag was independent of dye molecular weight. At the
          highest concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> examined, dye uptake via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>
          was linear and inversely proportional to molecular
          weight. These results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> does not increase
          in size as a function of time, as would be predicted by
          the dilation or aggregation model. Furthermore, these
          results strongly suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaNSC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">COP</ENAMEX> are
          unique molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biphasic membrane</ENAMEX> blebbing
          During the final phase of MTX-induced effects, there
          is a gross change in membrane integrity which allows
          rapid uptake of vital dyes, independent of dye molecular
          weight. This final phase is associated with release of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> which is indicative of oncotic cell death. However,
          over the course of the single cell experiments we noticed
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAECs</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> not only accumulate vital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dyes</ENAMEX>, but also undergo an enormous reorganization of the
          plasma membrane to form giant membrane blebs. An example
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>-induced membrane blebs is shown in the micrograph
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5which</ENAMEX> was obtained with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> optics and
          simultaneous bright-field and fluorescence illumination.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 minutes</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MTX</ENAMEX> treatment at room temperature,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">YO-PRO staining</ENAMEX> is prominent in the nucleus as expected,
          but is also visible in giant membrane blebs seen
          surrounding each cell in the field of view. At the
          present time, we do not know the composition of the
          membrane that comprise each bleb, or the structural
          features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> that would allow evagination or
          expansion of these membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at specific sites
          on the cell surface. However, blebbing presumably
          requires a change in osmotic pressure within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and
          so we reasoned that the blebs may be associated with the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of vital dye uptake. To test this
          hypothesis, we compared the morphological changes at the
          cell surface with dye uptake at the single cell level
          using time-lapsed videomicroscopy. A montage showing
          bright-field and fluorescence image pairs is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>
          6and the complete time-lapsed video sequence is shown in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montage</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">avi</ENAMEX>). As can be seen, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of ethidium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> is associated with the formation of membrane blebs
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6</ENAMEX>, yellow arrows) with an average diameter of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> microns. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blebs</ENAMEX> begin to form within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of MTX addition to the bath <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and remain
          at essentially a fixed size until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately time 22</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. As seen in the graphic presentation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> in each cell (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6</ENAMEX>, bottom right), bleb
          formation correlates with the initial phase of dye
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX>. From time <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28 to 38 minutes</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of
          dye uptake is observed, and this phase is associated with
          large bleb dilation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6</ENAMEX>, red arrows). These results
          demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">COP</ENAMEX> activity is associated with initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleb</ENAMEX> formation, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> release (i.e., cytolysis) is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with dramatic bleb dilation.

          movie 1
          To better appreciate the dynamic nature of bleb
          formation and to clearly observe the rapid nuclear
          staining associated with bleb dilation, we created
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-lapsed movies in which the bright-field and
          fluorescence images were merged into a single video (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EB</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">aviand Fig 3</ENAMEX>, YO-PRO.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">avi</ENAMEX>; 
          Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Files</ENAMEX> section). By
          setting your video <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> to continuously loop (i.e.,
          auto replay), and by focusing during each sequence on a
          single cell within the field of view, it can be seen that
          fluorescence increases slowly during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleb</ENAMEX> formation, but
          that intense rapid dye staining occurs during the bleb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilation</ENAMEX> phase. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 5</ENAMEX>, and in each of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">videos</ENAMEX>, MTX-induced blebbing results in an enormous
          increase in membrane surface area which may represent
          stretching of the membrane or an evagination of existing
          caveolar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> associated with the plasmalemma of
          endothelial cells. Endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are also known to
          have an extensive system of intracellular vesicles which
          are used for transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> to
          the interstitial space, i.e., transcytotic vesicles.
          Thus, membrane blebbing could reflect a massive
          exocytotic event. Why this would occur at selective sites
          on the plasmalemma remains unknown. Interestingly, the
          videos show several examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blebs</ENAMEX> forming on the
          surface of pre-existing blebs during the dilation phase.
          Thus, the structural element(s) that are required for
          localized evagination of membrane appears to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane-associated</ENAMEX> and/or "pulled" from the cytoplasm
          during the initial bleb formation. Irrespective of the
          exact mechanism, the experiments reported in the present
          study are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to correlate MTX-induced vital dye
          uptake with alterations in cell morphology.

          MTX-induced membrane blebbing requires Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+
          Previous studies on human skin fibroblasts showed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> had no effect on [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i , vital dye uptake, or fura-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> efflux
          when the cells were challenged in the absence of
          extracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elevating</ENAMEX> [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i with ionomycin had no effect on
          vital dye uptake, preliminary experiments in which
          fibroblasts were loaded intracellularly with the Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+chelator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAPTA</ENAMEX>, showed that MTX-induced responses were
          significantly delayed, suggesting that a rise in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i is necessary, but not sufficient for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MTX-induced COP</ENAMEX> formation. To determine if extracellular
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is also required for MTX-induced membrane blebbing,
          changes in cell morphology were correlated with ethidium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> in the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-free extracellular buffer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>; the video showing the merged phase and
          fluorescence images for this experiment is given in the 
          Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Files</ENAMEX> section; see
          Ca-free.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">avi</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> had no effect on BAECs incubated in Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-free buffer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, no dye uptake or membrane
          blebbing was observed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX> after the addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> to the bath solution. Subsequent readmission of Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+to the bath produced an increase in ethidium uptake
          that again followed a biphasic time course, virtually
          identical to the profile observed when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> was added to
          cells incubated with normal Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-containing</NUMEX> medium. As
          seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 7and</ENAMEX> the video, dramatic membrane blebbing
          and ethidium uptake is observed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 min</TIMEX> after re-addition
          of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+to the bath. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> experiments in which Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was removed and added back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> showed that these responses were dependent on the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>, i.e., no dye uptake or blebbing was
          detected in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 7</ENAMEX>). These results
          demonstrate that extracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is necessary for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MTX-induced COP</ENAMEX> formation and membrane blebbing, and
          suggest that both responses require Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx and a

        Conclusions
        In conclusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MTX</ENAMEX> treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAECs</ENAMEX> causes a specific
        sequence of events (i.e., a cell death cascade) that is
        triggered by the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaNSC</ENAMEX> and a rise in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        i . This is followed by formation or
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">COP</ENAMEX> which is correlated with the formation of
        membrane blebs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">COP</ENAMEX> appears to be a unique molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the plasma membrane and to have a fixed
        pore geometry and conductance for each vital dye examined.
        Furthermore, activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX> provides the initial driving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> for osmotic swelling and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleb</ENAMEX> formation. LDH release,
        indicative of the final phase of MTX-induced cell death, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with massive bleb dilation. Although, the
        molecular mechanisms associated with each step in the cell
        death cascade remain unknown, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> may prove to be an
        important tool for understanding the biochemical and
        biophysical links between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> activation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COP</ENAMEX>
        formation, and membrane blebbing.

          [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
          i was measured using the fluorescent
          indicator, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fura-2</ENAMEX>, as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
          Experiments were performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in the twelfth to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twentieth</ENAMEX> passage and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 days</TIMEX> post-confluency. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Briefly,</ENAMEX>
          cells were harvested and re-suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HBS</ENAMEX> containing
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 μM</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fura-2/AM</TIMEX>. Following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>, the
          cell suspension was diluted ∼ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBS</ENAMEX>, incubated
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional 30 min</TIMEX>, washed and resuspended in fresh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBS</ENAMEX>. Aliquots from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this final</TIMEX> suspension were subjected
          to centrifugation and washed twice immediately prior to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fluorescence</ENAMEX> measurement. Fluorescence was recorded using
          an SLM <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8100</TIMEX> spectrophotofluorometer; excitation
          wavelength alternated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 340 and 380</NUMEX> nm and
          fluorescence intensity was monitored at an emission
          wavelength of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">510</NUMEX> nm. All measurements were performed at
          37°C.
        
        
          Measurement of vital dye uptake
          An aliquot (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 ml</NUMEX>) of dispersed cells suspended in HBS
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> was placed in a cuvette. Following addition of
          ethidium bromide (final concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μM</NUMEX>),
          fluorescence was recorded as a function of time with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excitation</ENAMEX> and emission wavelengths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">302/560</NUMEX> nm,
          respectively. All ethidium bromide fluorescence values
          are corrected for background (extracellular) dye
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> and expressed as a percentage relative to
          the value obtained following complete permeabilization of
          the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μM</NUMEX> digitonin. Uptake of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">POPO-3</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YO-PRO-1</ENAMEX> was determined as described for ethidium with
          excitation/emission wavelengths of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">530/565 and 468/510</NUMEX>
          nm, respectively.
          For single cell measurement of vital dye uptake, BAECs
          in complete-DMEM were sparsely seeded on circular glass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coverslips</ENAMEX> and used within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 days</TIMEX> of seeding. The
          coverslips were mounted in temperature-controlled
          perfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> and placed on the stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX>
          Diaphot inverted microscope. The cells were illuminated
          with light from a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 watt</NUMEX> xenon lamp using a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">O-5717</ENAMEX>
          filter cube obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>.
          Epifluorescence was recorded using a Hamamatsu
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intensified CCD</ENAMEX> camera (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XC-77</ENAMEX>) and images were
          acquired and analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Image-1</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imaging</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Chester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> experiment, image
          pairs were collected at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty second</TIMEX> intervals. Images
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8-bit</NUMEX> gray scale) were stored as averages of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX>
          video frames (phase images) or as accumulations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          video frames (fluorescent images) with shutter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> switching between light and fluorescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illumination</ENAMEX>. The fluorescence images were used to
          determine dye uptake as a function of time. Using Image-1
          software, regions were defined over single cells and the
          average fluorescence intensity of the region was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX>. The phase images were contrast enhanced using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Debabelizer Pro</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equilibrium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sausalito</ENAMEX>, CA) and
          merged with the corresponding fluorescent images using
          Spot ™camera software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sterling</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-lapse videos were created using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Debabelizer Pro</ENAMEX> software with ethidium and YO-PRO
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epifluorescence</ENAMEX> displayed as red and green pseudocolor
          images, respectively.
        
        
          Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
          release
          Aliquots of dispersed cells (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 ml</NUMEX>) were incubated at
          37°C for various lengths of time in the presence and
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation
          for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 sec at 12,000 rpm</NUMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eppendorf</ENAMEX> centrifuge
          (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5415 C</ENAMEX>). The supernatants were removed, and placed
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. Enzyme activity in aliquots (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μl</NUMEX>) of the
          supernatants was determined using the LD-L kit from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>. All values are expressed as percent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDH</ENAMEX> released
          relative to the value obtained following permeabilization
          of the cells with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μM</NUMEX> digitonin.
