        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is a transcriptionally inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and as such
        is a storehouse of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maternal proteins</ENAMEX> and mRNA required for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX> and the initiation of zygotic development.
        However, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> comprising the mature egg
        proteome have yet to be identified. Identification and
        molecular characterization of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will provide
        much insight into the regulation of fertilization and early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenesis</ENAMEX>. The surface of the egg consists of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>, or zona pellucida, and plasma
        membrane, or oolemma, which sits beneath. The three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that comprise the zona pellucida (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ZP1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ZP2</ENAMEX> and
        ZP3) and their roles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>-binding are well
        characterized [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In contrast, little is known about
        the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the egg plasma membrane. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almeida et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] demonstrated the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±6Î²1</NUMEX> and Î±vÎ²3
        integrins at the egg surface by indirect immunofluorescence
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, and showed involvement of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±6Î²1</NUMEX> integrin in
        sperm-egg fusion by peptide and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> inhibition assays.
        Currently, however, the functional significance of egg
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">integrins</ENAMEX> is unclear. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        substantiates the involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î±4/Î±9</ENAMEX> integrin and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±6</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm-egg</ENAMEX> binding, while other results have
        been contradictory ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primakoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myles</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] for review). There is now compelling evidence
        demonstrating that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD9</TIMEX>, a tetraspan membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, is
        present on the oolemma and essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm-egg</ENAMEX> fusion,
        possibly by organizing functional multimolecular complexes
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Glycosyl-phophatidyniositol
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPI</ENAMEX>)-anchored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have also been described on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oolemma</ENAMEX> and implicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm-egg</ENAMEX> fusion; removal of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GPI-anchored protein</ENAMEX> from the egg plasma membrane results
        in greatly reduced fertilization rates without affecting
        sperm-zona pellucida binding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Other egg surface
        molecules are the adhesion molecules <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, ICAM-1
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , and the selectins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Additionally,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG</ENAMEX> receptor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , complement <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors C1q</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ,
        CD35 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD11b</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        exhibit oolemmal expression in a variety of mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        Molecular chaperones bind to nascent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
        endoplasmic reticulum (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>), promote proper protein folding,
        and prevent the aggregation of nonnative and misfolded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Most are constitutively expressed at low levels
        in almost all cell-types, but a number are upregulated in
        response to cellular stresses and these are known as the
        heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (HSPs). A number of molecular
        chaperones are retained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>, due to a conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> sequence at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KDEL</ENAMEX>), which binds to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> apparatus [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . More recently, however molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperones</ENAMEX> bearing
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> retention signal have been localized to the surface
        of different cell types. Calnexin, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calreticulin</ENAMEX>, GRP94
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">glycoprotein 96</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP78</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BiP</ENAMEX>) have been identified on
        the cell surface of immature thymocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . Cell
        surface expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRP94</ENAMEX> is found in lymphocytes and
        lymphoid-like cells from several vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and is
        phylogenetically conserved [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calnexin</ENAMEX> has been found
        on the surface of pro-B cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , as well as in a
        variety of mammalian culture cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> are found expressed on the cell surface in human and
        murine tumor cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . Calreticulin, GRP78
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDI</ENAMEX> were described on the plasma membrane of different
        cell types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP78</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP94</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDI</ENAMEX>, have
        been found on the surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat exocrine</ENAMEX> pancreatic cells
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRP78</ENAMEX> cell surface expression was recently
        shown in human endothelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        A number of reports have characterized constitutive
        expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP70 and HSP90</TIMEX> in both immature oocytes and
        ovulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> from various species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34 35 36</NUMEX> ] .
        HSP70 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP89</ENAMEX> are constitutively synthesized in the
        immature, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preovulatory</ENAMEX> mouse oocyte, although the
        expression is not heat-inducible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Levels of HSP70
        mRNA decrease following oocyte maturation and ovulation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP70</ENAMEX> is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to be
        transcribed at the onset of zygotic gene activation in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2-cell</TIMEX> mouse embryo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, while
        previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> did not localize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP70</TIMEX> to the
        oolemma, they did demonstrate that the presence of
        anti-HSP70 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody reduces bovine sperm-egg</ENAMEX> binding in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX>. indicating a possible role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP70</TIMEX> in
        fertilization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ). An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> receptor,
        identified on sea urchin oocytes, bears a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>-binding
        domain with sequence similarity to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HSP70</NUMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant protein binds sperm</ENAMEX> and inhibits fertilization
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Among the other molecular chaperones
        described here, calreticulin has been found in oocytes from
        a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munoz-Gotera et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] showed that calreticulin localizes to cortical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granules</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig oocytes</ENAMEX> and is released into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">perivitelline</ENAMEX> space following activation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDI</ENAMEX> has been
        identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urchin eggs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , though localized
        only to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>. Calnexin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP78</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP94</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ORP150</ENAMEX> have not
        been previously identified in oocytes of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        In order to identify maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> present in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ovulated</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>, we performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX> gel electrophoresis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> extracted from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2850</TIMEX> whole mature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and cored
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> spots that appeared to be most abundant.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concurrently</ENAMEX>, we surface labelled zona-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotin</ENAMEX> and performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX> avidin blotting to attempt to
        identify surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> that appeared to be
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">labelled</ENAMEX> were then cross-referenced between
        corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>-stained <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2D</ENAMEX> gels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">extracts</ENAMEX> and
        compared to microsequence data from the coomassie-stained
        reference gel. We report here the preliminary
        identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> highly abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSPs</ENAMEX> and related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaperones</ENAMEX> in the mature mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> that also appear to be
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">labelled</ENAMEX>. To support the hypothesis that these
        molecular chaperones localize to the egg surface, we
        performed indirect immunofluorescence analysis and found
        that antibodies to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSP90Î±</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP94</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRP78</ENAMEX> and Calreticulin
        specifically bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on the oolemma.

          Separation of surface-labeled biotinylated egg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> followed by avidin blotting was utilized to
          identify surface-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. For these experiments,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> zona-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biotinylated</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> were

          separated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX> gel electrophoresis, electroblotted to
          nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with
          streptavidin-HRP. Biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were visualized
          using enhanced chemiluminescence. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX>, untreated
          zona-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> were extracted, separated by 2D
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and the gel was silver-stained. The 2D

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> and cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were not, the blot
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Bwas stripped of streptavidin-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRP</ENAMEX> and

          cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to the cytoplasmic
          markers only recognized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spots on the blot and these
          spots correspond to the expected mass and pI of tubulin
          and actin (data not shown). No surface-labeling of these
          cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> occurred, validating the
          surface-specificity of the labeling method. Additionally,
          2D <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> of non-biotinylated oocytes were probed with
          streptavidin-HRP. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the unlabeled eggs
          bound streptavidin, corresponding to endogenous

          In order to provide additional evidence for surface

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaperones</ENAMEX> identified by surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">labelling</ENAMEX> were used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> chromatin stain
          was utilized to determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> had
          parthenogenetically activated (activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> are mitotic
          and exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chromatin poles rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, as
          indicated by an asterisk in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Figs 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5</ENAMEX>). When zona-free
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mature eggs</ENAMEX> were incubated with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GRP94</NUMEX>, the antibody
          specifically bound to isolated regions of the plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> in several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>; however, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>
          did not show any reactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). In contrast,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubating</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat IgG</ENAMEX> alone did not result in any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody reactivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). It is not clear from these
          preliminary results what common feature this
          subpopulation of positively staining eggs shared in
          common, but there does not appear to be an association
          between activation status and the degree of positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. Anti-HSP90 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> reacted very strongly
          with the egg plasma membrane of the majority of those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs examined</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). Incubating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> IgG
          alone did not result in any reactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP90</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was primarily localized to
          the microvillar region of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> (the region
          opposite the pole containing the metaphase chromatin)
          whereas the staining became delocalized and more intense
          following activation. Anti-calreticulin antibodies bound
          to the plasma membrane in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>,
          and no association with activation status was observed
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A). Anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GRP78</NUMEX> antibodies bound to the plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> in the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> examined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B).
          Incubating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in normal rabbit sera alone did not
          result in any reactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C). Neither anti-HSP70
          nor anti-calnexin antibodies resulted in positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunostaining</ENAMEX> in any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> examined (data not
          shown). A more rigorous quantitative analysis of the
          surface localization of these molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperones</ENAMEX> to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oolemma</ENAMEX> is now required.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        It has been estimated that individual mammalian cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at any given point

        1shows from ~<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can
        be resolved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coomassie-staining</ENAMEX>, and therefore these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are likely some of the most abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ovulated</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>. In this study we have found that a
        subset of these highly abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaperones</ENAMEX>. It will be of interest to establish the
        functional role of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> and early
        embryo. HSP70 is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to be expressed
        following zygotic gene activation in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-cell mouse
        embryo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39 40</NUMEX> ] and appears to play a role in
        developmental processes in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51 52</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP90</ENAMEX> has also been implicated in
        developmental regulation in the mouse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRP78</ENAMEX> is
        described as having a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-response function during avian
        development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . Activation of the zygotic genome
        initiates an accumulation of embryonic transcripts in the
        early <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-cell embryo, and this likely requires machinery
        to ensure the accurate translation and folding of nascent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> and chaperones found in the mature egg
        may represent a maternal stockpile of such folding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX>.
        Another preliminary finding of this study is that
        several molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperones</ENAMEX> appear to be localized to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> surface. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> were originally identified as a
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are upregulated in response to cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, most are also endogenously expressed under
        physiological conditions. Constitutive expression of a
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSPs</ENAMEX> and molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperones</ENAMEX> has been
        characterized in immature oocytes and mature mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39 40</NUMEX> ] , though none as yet have been localized to the

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 30 31</NUMEX> ] , though this phenomenon has not been previously
        described in oocytes or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. How these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        escaping <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER retention</ENAMEX> is not yet known. It is possible that
        in association with another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaperone</ENAMEX>'s KDEL sequence is sterically prevented from
        binding with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER retention receptors</ENAMEX>, and this allows the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to be transported to the plasma membrane. Another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is that alternative folding of the chaperone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> itself masks the retention sequence, allowing it to
        escape the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>. Further studies are needed to confirm the
        surface localization of these molecules and to determine
        which, if any, of these potential mechanisms are being
        employed.
        The functional significance of surface expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaperones</ENAMEX> in different cell types has yet to be
        determined. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> receptor identified on the surface of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> urchin oocytes has an extracellular domain that shows
        sequence similarity to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HSP70</NUMEX> and appears to be required for
        fertilization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the HSP
        family are known to be involved in the regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] for review). HSP70 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRP78</TIMEX> both
        have anti-apoptotic activity, whereas HSP90 appears to have
        both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities, depending
        on the specific stimuli received. Early bovine embryos
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSP70 antibodies</ENAMEX> exhibit
        increased apoptosis and reduced embryo viability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
        However, it is still controversial as to whether the
        unfertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is actively apoptotic or undergoes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> in the reproductive tract. During development,
        selective cell death by apoptosis becomes crucial, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chaperone</ENAMEX> molecules in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> may play a role in later
        apoptotic events. Future experiments need to be performed
        before the significance of findings presented here can be
        addressed, both at the functional and mechanistic level. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperones</ENAMEX> are proving to play a
        wide variety of roles in diverse cellular processes and
        this list will likely grow as our understanding of these
        molecules increases.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2D electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX>, we have identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chaperone proteins</ENAMEX> that are abundantly
        expressed in the mature mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>. Of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, GRP
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRP</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calreticulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP 90</ENAMEX> can be surface-labeled
        by biotin and appear to be localizing to the egg surface
        based on preliminary immunofluoresence data. These results
        provide preilimary evidence for the presence of these
        molecular chaperones on the egg surface.
