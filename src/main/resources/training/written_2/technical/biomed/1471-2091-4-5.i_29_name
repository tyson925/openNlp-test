        Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is a serine
        proteinase inhibitor in the serpin superfamily [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 50</TIMEX> kDa glycoprotein is apparently the most important
        physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>) and of urokinase plasminogen activator
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">uPA</NUMEX>). [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] It was shown to play a crucial role in the
        regulation of vascular thrombosis, tumor invasion,
        neovascularization, inflammation and wound healing. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ]
        Increased plasma levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> were found to be
        correlated with an increased risk for cardiovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] The essential function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrinolytic</ENAMEX> system has been confirmed by studies with
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9</NUMEX> ]
        PAI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> shares a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> homology with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> other serpins. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] The X-ray structure of active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] consists of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sheets (A<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-C</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine helices</NUMEX> (a-i) and a reactive
        center loop (RCL). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RCL</ENAMEX> contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues Ser331</ENAMEX> to
        Arg356 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P16-P10</ENAMEX>'), and within it there is a peptide loop
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">351</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">357, P5'-P11</TIMEX>'), which is defined as the
        distal hinge (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). It should be noted that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placement</ENAMEX> and conformation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCL</ENAMEX> in active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> is
        quite different from that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">latent PAI-1</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] The
        movement of the distal hinge and the insertion of the RCL
        into sheet A as strand 4A (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">s4A</NUMEX>) should take place during
        the transition from the active into the latent form of
        PAI-1.
        The catalytic center of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA interacts</ENAMEX> with the reactive
        site of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">concominant</ENAMEX> formation of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 molar</TIMEX>,
        SDS-stable complex. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The P1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Arg346</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCL</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> is an essential determinant for its target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> and inhibitory activity. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] Since many
        serpins with identical amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residue</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P1</NUMEX> position
        display different specificities, it is unlikely that the P1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residue</ENAMEX> is the sole determinant for target protease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>, other regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> may also affect its
        specificity toward target proteases. The variable region in
        serine proteases domain determines their specificity for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. Alignment of variable region <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the serine
        proteases shows a remarkable correlation between the
        composition of this area and their susceptibility to
        inhibition by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] Both tPA
        and uPA, the target proteases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>, contain a
        relatively extensive variable region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> present at
        identical position. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmin</ENAMEX> and thrombin with moderate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivity</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> have relatively short variable
        regions which contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two to three</NUMEX> positively charged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. For example, positively charged amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in
        the variable region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>, uPA and thrombin play dominant
        roles in the specific interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ]
        Furthermore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu350</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P4</ENAMEX>') of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        mediate the interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        In this study, By producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> and several single
        site mutations in the distal hinge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> in a
        baculovirus expression system, we were able to find out the
        role of the distal hinge in conformational transition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> and to elucidate the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Glu351</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> for
        serine protease specificities.
      
      
        Results
        
          Characterization of wtPAI-1
          To confirm the validity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant PAI-1</ENAMEX> as a
          model to study the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX> secreted from human
          fibrosarcoma cells, we compared the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> and
          the fibrosarcoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> first by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and immunoblot
          with anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1 monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX>. The molecular
          weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> was found to be lower than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native PAI-1</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~50 kDa</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). We assumed that this is due to a
          lower (probably different) extent of glycosylation in the
          baculovirus expression system. Indeed, when both proteins
          were deglycosylated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-glycanase they were found to
          have an essentially identical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.W.</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~48 kDa</NUMEX>) and to
          cross-react immunochemically (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). Furthermore, when
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> was chromatographed on heparin-Sepharose it
          was found to be > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> pure by silver staining of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Alane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, the specific inhibitory activity of
          wtPAI was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 Â± 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ug</ENAMEX> just after purification, and was
          increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84 Â± 21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ug</ENAMEX> after denatured by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Gdn</ENAMEX>-HCl
          and refolded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> mM sodium acetate (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. In
          contrast, the specific activity of the fibrosarcoma PAI-1
          was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 5 Â±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 U/</ENAMEX>ug before activation, and was only
          increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45 Â± 16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/Î¼g</ENAMEX> after denaturing and refolding.
          The high specific inhibitory activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wt-PAI-1</ENAMEX> could
          be due to the fact that it was secreted from insect
          High-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cells cultured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27Â°C</TIMEX>, while the fibrosarcoma
          preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> was obtained from the medium of
          fibrosarcoma cells cultured at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Exposure to
          the higher temperature could accelerate the conversion of
          the inhibitor into its latent form.
          The functional stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrosarcoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1</ENAMEX> in the absence or in presence of
          vitronectin are illustrated in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1C</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> lost
          its inhibitory activity at the same pace as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrosarcoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1</ENAMEX>, indicating that its functional half
          life as an inhibitor and its ability to be stabilized by
          vitronectin are similar to those of the fibrosarcoma
          PAI-1.
          The second-order rate constants (in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M -1s -1units</ENAMEX>) of
          the fibrosarcoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> and the wtPAI-1 towards t-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> were
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.4 Â± 0.5 Ã— 10 7and 1.7 Â± 0.6 Ã— 10 7</NUMEX>, and towards uPA
          were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.1 Â± 1.4 Ã— 10 7and 4.4 Â± 1.6</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 7</NUMEX>, respectively.
          These results show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> could inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> or
          uPA at the same rate as the fibrosarcoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. In
          addition, it is known that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1</ENAMEX> inhibits either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> or
          uPA by forming a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 SDS</TIMEX> stable complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , wtPAI-1
          indeed could form SDS stable complex with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> or uPA
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) just as fibrosarcoma PAI-1.
        
        
          Single site mutations within the distal hinge of
          PAI-1
          Since a proline occurs not only in position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">357</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>, but also in the corresponding position of several
          other serpins (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) we attempted to find out how does
          a mutation of P357 affect the inhibitory activity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mutant of Pro357Gly</ENAMEX> blocked the inhibitory
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). Similarly, a mutation into
          proline of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp355</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Arg356</NUMEX> also inactivated the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. It should be noted that all these mutants
          could be activated to a similar extent by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Gnd</ENAMEX>-HCl
          (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> inhibitory activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>, activated under
          the same conditions). These results suggest that a single
          site mutation at either one of the positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">355, 356</TIMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">357</NUMEX> significantly inactivates PAI-1.
          To elucidate the mechanism through which such
          mutations affect the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>, we determined
          their effect on the functional stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> and on
          its ability to form an SDS stable complex with either tPA
          or uPA. As seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B, the rate of the spontaneous
          inactivation of the inhibitor was significantly increased
          upon mutation: the functional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> life of the mutants
          Asp355Pro, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg356Pro and Pro357Gly</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23.8 Â± 4.5 min</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26.2 Â± 3.7 min and 24.7 Â± 4.8 min</NUMEX>, respectively, while
          that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">89.8 Â± 8.7 min.</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Interestingly</ENAMEX>, there
          was no significant difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> tested
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> in their ability to inactivate either tPA
          or uPA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). They could also form SDS-stable
          complexes with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> or uPA just as well as wtPAI-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3A).
          An interesting structural similarity among several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serpins</ENAMEX> is known to occur at the position corresponding
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">355</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. While in PAI-1 this position
          accommodates a negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspartic acid residue</ENAMEX>,
          in other serpins it sometimes accommodates its non
          charged analog asparagine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Asp355His,
          Asp355Lys, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asp355Glu</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asp355Gln and Asp355Asn</TIMEX> were
          prepared and used to show that the negatively charged
          aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> is essential (though not
          sufficient) for its inhibitory activity. Mutation of
          Asp355 by asparagine (the non charged analog of aspartic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>), or by histidine or lysine (that have a positively
          charged side <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>) or by alanine (neutral), inactivated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Replacement</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspartic acid residue</ENAMEX> even by
          the negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamic acid</ENAMEX> (a very close analog
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspartic acid</ENAMEX>) did not significantly suffice to
          restore a full inhibitory activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B).
          After activation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 M Gnd-HCl</ENAMEX>, each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          mutants exhibited a relatively high inhibitory activity,
          but their specific activities were still much lower than
          that of wtPAI-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Among them, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asp355Lys</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.1</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ug</ENAMEX>) had the lowest specific activity, while the
          Asp355Asn (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 Â± 4.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/Î¼g</ENAMEX>) had the highest specific
          activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Although they had lower specific
          activities, all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> mentioned above could
          still form SDS-stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> or uPA just as
          the wtPAI-1 (data not shown).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional mutations, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg356Ala and Arg356Glu</TIMEX>,
          were prepared to further elucidate the role of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg356</TIMEX>.
          The specific inhibitory activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arg356Ala</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX> Â±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.5 U/Î¼g</ENAMEX>, while Arg356Glu exhibited essentially no
          inhibitory activity. This specific activity was increased
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35.4</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ug</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg356Ala</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/Î¼g</ENAMEX> for
          Arg356Glu after denature and refolding. Just like
          ARG356Pro, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Arg356Ala and Arg356Glu</TIMEX> were much more labile
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>. These results suggest that the role of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp355-Pro357</ENAMEX> segment is to stabilize the inhibitory
          conformation of PAI-1.

          The specific inhibitory activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wtPAI-1,</ENAMEX>
          Glu351Ala and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351Arg</ENAMEX> were assessed with uPA and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S-2444</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fg</ENAMEX>. 4A, the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wtPAI-1,</ENAMEX>
          Glu351Ala and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351Arg</TIMEX> after denatured by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M Gdn</ENAMEX>-HCl
          and dialyzed against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM sodium acetate, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.6</NUMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>
          Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 and 68 Â± 9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/ug</ENAMEX>, respectively. Glu351Ala
          had a higher, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Glu351Arg</NUMEX> lower specific activity than
          wtPAI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The specific activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> determined
          immediately after purification displayed similar pattern
          as that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> reactivated. There was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 15-20%</NUMEX>
          increase after reactivation compared to each untreated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> itself. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> also
          spontaneously lost their inhibitory activity(convert to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">latency</ENAMEX>) as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>, but at different rates. The
          functional stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351Ala</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351Arg</TIMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 18 Â± 5</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 Â± 8 and 14 Â± 3 minutes</TIMEX>, respectively. It
          suggested that the specific activities measured above, to
          some extent, proportionally represent the functional
          stability. More importantly, amount <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> formed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> remained after incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4C) were proportionally concordant with the results
          obtained from enzymatic stability assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). This
          proves that results from enzymatic assay are valid. The
          result of functional stability suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351</ENAMEX> is
          indeed involved in the conformational transition of
          PAI-1.
        
        
          Inhibition of thrombin by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neutralization</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> by Thrombin
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutants</ENAMEX> inhibited thrombin more efficiently than
          wtPAI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, more importantly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351Ala</TIMEX> was better than
          Glu351Arg in inhibiting thrombin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inhibition</ENAMEX> of
          thrombin by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351Arg</TIMEX> was almost as same as by Glu351Ala
          in presence of vitronectin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B), which facilitated
          the thrombin inhibition by both mutants. When excess
          equal amount of thrombin was incubated with equal amount
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> in term of inhibitory activity against uPA,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were neutralized faster by thrombin
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>, and vitronectin also facilitated the
          neutralization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351Ala</ENAMEX> or Glu351Arg by thrombin,
          just similar to the wtPAI-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C).
        
        
          Inhibition of plasmin by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAI</ENAMEX>-1s
          When plasmin was incubated with increased amount of
          equal active <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> in absence or in presence of
          vitronectin, it was inhibited faster by mutants than by
          wtPAI-1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>); and both of mutant also
          displayed improved inhibition toward plasmin in presence
          of vitronectin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Kinetic analysis
          The rate constants of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351Ala</ENAMEX> and
          Glu351Arg were similar (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), however, The rate
          constants of inhibition toward uPA by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351Ala</TIMEX> and
          Glu351Arg were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 7</NUMEX>-fold higher than by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>,
          respectively. Moreover, The rate constants of Glu351Ala
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351Arg</ENAMEX> for thrombin inhibition were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 4</NUMEX> folds
          higher than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX> and rate constants of
          Glu351Ala and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351Arg</ENAMEX> to plasmin were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> fold higher
          than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>. This indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351</ENAMEX> is not
          essential for the interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>, but it is an very
          important determinant for the optimal interaction with
          uPA, thrombin and plasmin.
        
      
      
        Disscusion
        
          Cognate protease specificity
          Improvements in specificity of mutants for uPA
          indicates that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351</TIMEX> involve in the interaction with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uPA</ENAMEX>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
          that the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> toward uPA is partially
          mediated by the negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> located in the
          C-terminal of cleavage site in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. The interaction of
          Glu351 with uPA is much more important than that of
          Glu351 with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>, which is demonstrated by improved
          reactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glu351</ENAMEX> mutants toward uPA, but not toward
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>, showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> is not directly interact with
          Glu351 of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glu351</ENAMEX> is necessary for the
          optimal interaction with uPA. Our results are concordant
          with previous study, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] which suggests that serpin
          body-protease body interactions play significant roles in
          determining serpin inhibitory activity against target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteases</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Non-cognate protease
          Substitution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Glu351</ENAMEX> also altered the specificity
          toward non-cognate proteases: plasmin and thrombin. Glu
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">351</NUMEX> may provide steric hindrance that slows the rate
          of thrombin or plasmin inhibition. Mutations at Glu351
          may decrease the original repulsive interactions with
          variable region of thrombin, which may slow the rate of
          thrombin inhibition, or results in favorable interactions
          that may not exist when wtPAI-1 react with thrombin. So,
          both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351Arg and Glu351Arg</TIMEX> are better thrombin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>. Similar results were observed
          for plasmin. With single mutation at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu351</TIMEX>, we
          improved reactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> to thrombin and plasmin
          without significantly affecting its specificity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>.
          This substantiates previous mutagenesis studies, which
          demonstrated that repulsive interactions and/or lack of
          productive electrostatic interactions between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Glu39</TIMEX> and
          Glu192 of thrombin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> are responsible for the slow
          reaction of thrombin with this serpin. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
          Furthermore, the rapid inhibition of plasmin requires a
          non-covalent interaction between an amino-terminal site
          of plasmin and a carboxyl-terminal on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-plasmin</ENAMEX>, and a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCL</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> contributes to its
          specific interaction with proteases. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 27</NUMEX> ] The
          specificity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants toward thrombin and
          plasmin implicates that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Glu351</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> is involved in
          its specificity toward thrombin and plasmin.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Single site mutations within the segment
        Asp355<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-Arg356-Pro357</TIMEX> of PAI-1 yield Gdn-HCl activatable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that can still form SDS stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with
        plasminogen activators, with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order inhibition
        constants that are similar to the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, the conversion of these mutants to latent
        forms was ~<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4</ENAMEX> fold faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>, suggesting that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asp355-Pro357</ENAMEX> segment is involved in maintaining the
        inhibitory conformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. Glu351 contributes to the
        optimal functional stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> and participates its
        conformational stability. More importantly, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Glu351</NUMEX> of PAI-1
        is a specificity determinant for uPA, thrombin and plasmin,
        but not for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uPA</ENAMEX> inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. The assay for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> inhibitory
          activity toward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> was the same for uPA except
          that the samples were incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> and S<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-2288</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> inhibitory activity is expressed as the number of
          international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAs</ENAMEX> inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>. Specific
          activity of uPA and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U/Î¼g</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">764</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">U/Î¼g</ENAMEX>, respectively. For the functional stability,
          wtPAI-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, or mutants were incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Aliquots were
          taken out at times indicated and analyzed immediately as
          described above. The specific activity obtained at time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">zero</ENAMEX> was assigned a value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>. To provide the
          evidence to support the conclusion obtained from enzyme
          assay, certain amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wtPAI-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E351R and E351A</TIMEX> were
          incubated with equal amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>
          before put on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, at same time these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>, respectively,
          before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> were incubated with same amount of tPA
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein samples</ENAMEX> prepared
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two time</TIMEX> points were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and western
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> as described before.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrombin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>), or plasmin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) was
          incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min with same amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wtPAI-1,</ENAMEX>
          E351A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E351R</ENAMEX> in term of inhibitory activity toward uPA
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> in the concentration range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-10 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) in
          absence or presence of vitronectin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">60 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX>
          increase of absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405</NUMEX> nm were recorded after
          adding S-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2238</TIMEX> (final concentration <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.25 mM</NUMEX>) for thrombin,
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-Nitroanilide</ENAMEX> (final
          concentration <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 mM</NUMEX>) for plasmin. Thrombin, or plasmin
          activity without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX> was taken as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Neutralization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> by Thrombin
          wtPAI-1 and mutants were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> molar
          excess of thrombin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 nM</NUMEX>) in the absence or presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitronectin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 nM</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> experiments were carried out
          in the absence of thrombin. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, the
          activity of thrombin was quenched by the addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hirudin</ENAMEX> (final concentration, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> units /ml), resulting in
          inhibition of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95%</NUMEX> of the amidolytic activity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombin</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, the residual <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1</ENAMEX> inhibitory
          activity was determined by titration of aliquots on uPA,
          using S2444 as substrate. The increase of the optical
          density at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405</NUMEX> nm in the samples was corrected for the
          values measured with (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hirudin-inactivated</NUMEX>) thrombin
          alone, since the amidolytic activity of thrombin on S2444
          was not completely blocked by hirudin,
        
        
          Complex formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAI-1s</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> or uPA
          Complex formation of the fibrosarcoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>, wtPAI-1
          or its mutants with single-chain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> or uPA were
          performed as described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Samples of PAI-1s
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>) were incubated in the absence or in the presence of
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold excess of uPA or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tPA</ENAMEX> in the activity assay
          buffer. Following a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 min</NUMEX> incubation at room
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, the samples were subjected to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
          and immunoblotting as described above.
