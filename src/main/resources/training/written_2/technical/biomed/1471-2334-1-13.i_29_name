        The importance of bacterial infections that complicate
        the clinical course of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with human immunodeficiency
        virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) infection has been recognized since the
        beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Several factors
        predispose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection to bacterial
        infections. These factors include abnormalities in humoral
        and cell-mediated immunity, phagocytic cell dysfunction,
        and skin and mucous membrane defects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The presence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neutropenia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] use of central venous catheters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] , low CD4 +lymphocyte count, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intravenous drug</ENAMEX> use [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] are cited as risk factors for bacteremic infections in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. Bacterial infections are
        responsible for the immediate cause of death of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 30%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The purpose of this
        study was to describe the bacterial pathogens causing blood
        stream infection, identify the risk factors for the
        development of blood stream infection, and determine the
        impact of blood stream infection on the outcome of
        hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        This prospective, observational study included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,225</NUMEX>
        consecutive hospital admissions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">599</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection treated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Medical Center</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacksonville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1995 through March 1998</TIMEX>.
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection who were admitted to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> were included in the study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Medical</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">528</NUMEX>-bed, inner-city teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affiliated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Florida</ENAMEX>. Because of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital's</ENAMEX> inner-city location, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX>. The need for informed consent was waived
        by the institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>.
        The isolation of a bacterium in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or more blood cultures
        was diagnostic of bacterial blood stream infection. Blood
        isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci, 
        Corynebacterium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bacillus species</ENAMEX>, 
        Propionibacterium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
        Peptostreptococcus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
        Clostridium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and unidentified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive rods were considered contaminated if a single
        blood culture yielded the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> or the clinician did not
        initiate treatment, considering it not a true infection.
        Mycobacterial infections were excluded from the study. The
        place of acquisition of the blood stream infection was
        defined as nosocomial if the infection developed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of hospitalization or within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> of previous
        hospitalization. We collected data on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, sex, race,
        exposure category for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection, place of acquisition,
        white blood cell count, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +lymphocyte count, worst Acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE</ENAMEX>) II score
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of hospital admission, presence of blood
        stream infection, intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> admission status,
        length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. The
        source of the blood stream infection was identified by the
        isolation of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogenic organism</ENAMEX> from both the
        source and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score and predicted
        mortality rate for each hospital admission were calculated
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The standardized mortality ratio was determined by
        dividing the actual mortality by the predicted mortality.
        For the purpose of this study, each admission was analyzed
        independently.
        StatView <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> computer software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>)
        was used for statistical analysis. Each mean was expressed
        with its standard deviation. Comparisons between groups
        were made using logistic regression analysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">U , Χ 2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> exact tests. When
        available, the continuity-corrected 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values were used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Χ 2analysis</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were
        considered significant.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1provides</ENAMEX> demographic, exposure category, and
        health status data on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,225</NUMEX> hospital admissions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">599</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. Because some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were
        admitted more than once during the study period, in this
        report the word 
        patient does not necessarily mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thirty-four</NUMEX> percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>

        In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,225</NUMEX> admissions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>
        episodes of blood stream infection. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> infections,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX>) were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> acquired and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>) were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nosocomial</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">345</NUMEX> admissions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>) during
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year of the study had blood stream infection
        compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435</NUMEX> admissions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX>) during the second
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">445</NUMEX> admissions (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>) during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</TIMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5748</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        bacteremia were identified in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>) and
        included <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>, urinary tract infection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peritonitis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>, and cellulitis, pancreatitis, central

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella typhi</ENAMEX> and 
        Klebsiella pneumoniae , were isolated
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> during the same hospitalization; both were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> acquired. The pathogens causing blood stream
        infection are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        episodes of blood stream infection during the study period,
        all during different hospitalizations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>

        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0042</NUMEX>). The incidence of blood
        stream infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> was
        higher than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +lymphocyte count
        was similar and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score and white blood cell
        count higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream infection
        compared with those without blood stream infection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream infection, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> had a CD4

        Discussion
        This study describes the incidence of bacterial blood
        stream infection as well as its causative pathogens, risk
        factors for its development, and its impact on outcome in
        hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. Blood stream infection
        developed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; of these infections, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX>
        were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> acquired and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> were nosocomial. The
        incidence rate of blood stream infection was higher in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>. There
        were no significant differences in sex, age, and CD4
        +lymphocyte count between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with and patients
        without blood stream infection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score and
        white blood cell count of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream
        infection were higher than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without blood
        stream infection. The mortality and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> admission rates of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream infection were higher and their
        length of hospital stay longer than those of patients
        without blood stream infection. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood
        stream infection, the mortality rate of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>-acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was lower than that of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nosocomial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteremia</ENAMEX> is more common in hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The
        incidence of nonmycobacterial bacteremias in hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2% to 9%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Most
        blood stream infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> are community
        acquired [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . In developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, the incidence
        rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bacteremia</ENAMEX> has declined after the
        introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . In the present study, the incidence of
        blood stream infection among hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>, and most of these infections were community
        acquired. Despite the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> during the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> period of our study, we did not find a decline in the
        rate of bacteremia in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX>. However, the
        mortality rate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream infection
        declined during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</TIMEX> of the study, reflecting the
        potential benefit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>, and high <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>
        score were found to be risk factors for blood stream
        infection in hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection in
        the present study. Because there were only few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> in
        the present study and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> were more
        likely than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> to be injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, we do
        not think there is an independent association between race
        and bacteremia. Previous studies have shown injection drug
        use to be a risk factor for bacteremia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 14</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        like the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tumbarello et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , our study did
        not find injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use to be a risk factor for blood
        stream bacterial infection. The earlier stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection in the injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> in our study may
        explain their lower bacteremia rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neutropenia</ENAMEX> is
        reported to be a risk factor for the development of
        bacterial infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ] . However, in our study, neither the prevalence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukopenia</ENAMEX> nor the total white blood cell count was lower
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream bacterial infection compared
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without blood stream bacterial infection. In
        fact, the white blood cell count was higher in patients
        with than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without bacterial blood stream
        infection. Unlike other studies, which showed the CD4
        +lymphocyte count to be low in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        blood stream bacterial infection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 16</ENAMEX> ] , the CD4
        +lymphocyte count did not differ between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without bacterial blood stream infection in the
        present study. The lack of association between bacteremia
        and low CD4 +lymphocyte count or leukopenia in the present
        study may reflect the earlier stage of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies have shown the presence of central
        venous catheters to be a risk factor for bacterial blood
        stream infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 11 14 16 17</NUMEX> ] . In the present
        study, an intravascular catheter was the source of the
        blood stream infection in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>; this was probably
        due to infrequent use of central venous catheters and
        shorter length of hospital stay. As in the study by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tumbarello et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , higher severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>,
        measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score, was associated in the present
        study with the development of bacterial blood stream
        infection.
        The common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of blood stream infection in patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection include the lungs, skin, subcutaneous
        tissue, and intravascular catheters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 18 19</NUMEX> ] . In
        the present study, the most common source of bacteremia was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are responsible for most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacteremias</ENAMEX> in hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">More gram-positive than gram</NUMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> were
        isolated from the blood stream of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Many
        studies have shown 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Staphylococcus species</ENAMEX> to be the most
        common isolates in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 11 13 16 20</NUMEX> ] . In our study 
        Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most
        common isolate. The rate of pneumococcal bacteremia is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX>-fold higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with than in patients
        without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Because most of the blood
        stream infections were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> acquired and the most
        common source of infection was <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, 
        Staphylococci were less frequent than
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pneumoniae</ENAMEX> and 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> .
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> aeruginosa is being recognized more
        frequently as causing both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-acquired and
        nosocomial bacteremia in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 18 20 22 23</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hospitalization</ENAMEX>, neutropenia, antibiotic
        therapy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> use, and low CD4 +lymphocyte count are
        risk factors for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> aeruginosa bacteremia in patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 24</NUMEX> ] . Previously, we reported that
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> aeruginosa is the most common
        pathogen causing bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ]
        . However, compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumococcal pneumonia</ENAMEX>, 
        Pseudomonas <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> is less likely
        to be associated with bacteremia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The annual
        incidence rate of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> aeruginosa infection in patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection is estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.51</NUMEX> cases per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
        admissions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> aeruginosa has been reported to be
        the causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6% to 18%</NUMEX> of bacteremias in
        hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16 20</NUMEX> ] . In
        the present study, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> aeruginosa was responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>
        of the bacteremias.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection, although bacteremia in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> is more frequently associated with growth of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX>-positive pathogens, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">genitourinary sepsis</ENAMEX> is more
        frequently related to the detection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Our finding of 
        E <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> to be the most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> differs from findings in previous
        studies. In a recent study of blood stream infection of
        hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, 
        E <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> was not even mentioned among
        the common etiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In the present study a
        significant number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream
        infection were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, who are at higher risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">genitourinary</ENAMEX> infection. The relatively high number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may explain the high rates of 
        E <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli blood</ENAMEX> stream infection in our
        study.
        The present study showed that the presentation with or
        the development of blood stream infection in hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> leads to poor outcome, as evidenced by
        increased mortality, length of hospital stay, and intensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> unit admission rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> mortality rates of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream infection range
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9% to 63%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 9 11 12 13 14 16</NUMEX> ] . In the present
        study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> mortality rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood
        stream infection was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream
        infection, we found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of increased mortality
        with high <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score and hospital acquisition of the
        infection, but not with low CD4 +lymphocyte count. Because
        nosocomial bacteremia is likely to develop in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        a complicated hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> and lead to multiple organ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX>, its association with an increased mortality
        rate is not surprising. Previous studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream infection have shown that a high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score predicts an increased risk of death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 27</NUMEX>
        ] . Although we did not find a significant association
        between mortality and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +lymphocyte count, a previous
        study showed that a low CD4 +lymphocyte count is associated
        with increased mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with nosocomial blood
        stream infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        Our study has several limitations. The risk factors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection were not identified in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>, most probably
        because of the health care providers' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' lack of
        openness with regard to sexual activity. Because we were
        unable to document the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' antiretroviral therapy and
        previous antimicrobial treatment or chemoprophylaxis, we
        could not assess their impact on the incidence, etiology,
        and outcome of bacterial blood stream infection. In many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the source of the blood stream infection was not
        identified. Finally, because the study was limited to a
        single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the results may not apply to other patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Bacteremia occurs in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection who require admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Most of
        the bacteremias are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> acquired. The most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> isolated from the blood stream of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection is 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pneumoniae</ENAMEX> , and the most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is 
        E <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> score of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with blood stream infection is higher than that of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without blood stream infection. The presence of
        blood stream infection is associated with an increased
        mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and intensive care
        unit admission rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> of the incidence,
        etiology, and risk factors of blood stream infection in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection can lead to preventive and
        therapeutic measures that may reduce the associated
        increased mortality and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX>.
