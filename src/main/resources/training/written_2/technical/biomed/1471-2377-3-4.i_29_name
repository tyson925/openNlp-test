          Selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidate Genes</ENAMEX> for ISGS
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes for this study include the gene
          encoding Î²-fibrinogen and the genes encoding platelet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycoprotein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ia/IIa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ib/IX/V</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX>. In selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes for an association
          study, effects of polymorphisms on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, function,
          or expression of a gene product should be considered.
          Failure to consider the underlying pathophysiologic
          mechanism when searching for polymorphisms associated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> might result in mistaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . We studied genes related to thrombosis
          because the importance of thrombosis in acute ischemic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stroke</ENAMEX> has been established conclusively in numerous
          clinical trials of treatment and prevention [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX>
          ] . We focused on genetic variations in the fibrinogen
          gene cluster because of the efficacy of fibrinolytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in the acute treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>. In
          addition, we studied genes encoding for platelet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> because of the efficacy of platelet
          anti-aggregant therapy in preventing first-time and
          recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic strokes</ENAMEX>.
          To restrict the choice of polymorphisms worthy of
          further study, we constructed an evidence table from
          reports appearing in MEDLINE-indexed <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">journals</ENAMEX> describing cross-sectional or longitudinal
          studies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> thrombosis gene polymorphism in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. Results were
          classified as positive or negative according to whether a
          significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) was found between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stroke</ENAMEX> (or carotid atherosclerosis) and a polymorphism.
          Because it is biologically plausible that a prothrombotic
          polymorphism may exert a differential effect across
          different ages, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>, and ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, we classified
          studies as having positive results even if they had only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> positive subgroup. We considered a polymorphism
          worthy of further study if it was not already a clearly
          established stroke risk factor and if at least one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> study was positive.
          Regarding a possible relationship to stroke risk, most
          studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hemostasis genes</ENAMEX> have been inconclusive at
          best and unconvincing at worst. On the basis of the
          evidence, we concluded that the polymorphisms of factor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII R353Q</ENAMEX>, factor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Val34Leu</ENAMEX>, plasminogen activator
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">inhibitor-1</ENAMEX> 4G<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/5G</ENAMEX>, and prothrombin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">G20210A</ENAMEX> were not
          worthy of further investigation because large studies had
          consistently yielded negative results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). For
          similar reasons, we decided not to study factor V R506Q
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1691A</TIMEX>; i.e., the factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V Leiden</ENAMEX> mutation), despite its
          apparent association with cerebral vein thrombosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          . Although unknown point mutations in the coding regions
          of these genes may relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and relevant
          variations in gene expression elements may exist, we
          decided to focus on more immediately high-yield candidate
          genes.
          The results of three large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> studies listed in
          Table 1led us to conclude that the Î²-fibrinogen gene
          might be a promising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fibrinogen</ENAMEX> is a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340,000</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Da GP</ENAMEX> consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> polypeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î±,</ENAMEX>
          Î², and Î³. The genes that encode these polypeptides reside
          on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4q</NUMEX> in a cluster. In a study of the
          Î²-fibrinogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G455A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kessler et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
          did not find an overall association between genotype and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, but heterozygosity for the A allele was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with large-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.045</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmidt et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
          observed an association between carotid atherosclerosis
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C148T</NUMEX> polymorphism in a population-based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-sectional</ENAMEX> study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with normal neurologic
          status. Carotid atherosclerosis was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.6%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with the C/C genotype, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.1%</NUMEX> of those with the
          C/T genotype, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> of those with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T/T</ENAMEX> genotype ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>). Abnormal results on
          carotid ultrasonography were significantly more common in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T/T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.29</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.91</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20.71</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carter et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] on the G448A
          polymorphism of the Î²-fibrinogen gene suggested that
          mechanisms linking fibrinogen and the development of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> may be different in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
          Several studies listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1suggested</ENAMEX> that
          polymorphisms of genes controlling the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> platelet
          glycoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ia/IIa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ib/IX/V</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb/IIIa</ENAMEX>,
          which play a role in adhesion, might also be promising
          candidate risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP Ia/IIa</ENAMEX> (integrin Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î² 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) is involved in collagen-induced
          platelet aggregation. It does not bind collagen monomers,
          but it does bind collagen fibrils and immobilized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>. Binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIa/IIa</ENAMEX> to collagen induces a
          conformational change in receptor structure that enhances
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX>. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX> of interest is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIa</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlsson et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIa</ENAMEX> (Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C807T</TIMEX> genotype distribution in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> or transient ischemic
          attacks with that in hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> and in healthy blood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>. An
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between the polymorphism and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> was not
          seen overall. However, there was an overrepresentation of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C807T</NUMEX> polymorphism in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with stroke <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> or younger ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>) versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">age-matched</ENAMEX> controls
          (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.02</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.20</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.61</NUMEX>). No such
          overrepresentation was detected in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX> of interest is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIbÎ±</ENAMEX>, a
          transmembranous platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX> (molecular weight, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143,000</NUMEX>)
          that forms noncovalent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIbÎ²</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIX</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPV</ENAMEX> to form the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GPIb/IX/V</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, which is involved in
          shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-induced platelet activation by binding to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Willebrand</ENAMEX> factor (vWF). This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may be
          particularly relevant in large-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> atherosclerotic
          ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> because high shear stresses like those
          seen in atherosclerotic arteries increase ligand-receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> may also have a role in so-called
          aspirin failure, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suffer stroke despite
          taking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin prophylaxis</ENAMEX>. Cyclooxygenase
          inhibition by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> has little effect on initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> in response to shear forces. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> GPIbÎ±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> is referred to as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VNTR</ENAMEX>" because it consists
          of a variable number of tandem repeats of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs,
          each repeat leading to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> addition that
          pushes a vWF-binding domain further away from the
          platelet membrane surface. Another is human platelet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-2</ENAMEX> (HPA-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), a mutation that codes for either a thr
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPA-2a</ENAMEX>) or met (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPA-2b</ENAMEX>) at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPA-2</ENAMEX> site
          resides next to the vWF and high-affinity thrombin
          binding sites.
          In a case-control study of these polymorphisms,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conejero et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] found that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> was associated with both the C/B
          genotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> polymorphism (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.83</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.16</NUMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.07</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0114</NUMEX>) and the Î² allele of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPA-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.11%</NUMEX> carried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> Î²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.58%</NUMEX> of controls (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.40</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.04</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.63</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0244</NUMEX>). Neither polymorphism
          showed significant differences related to age, sex, or
          type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> also
          correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary artery disease</ENAMEX>, but neither
          correlated with deep vein thrombosis. This is the
          converse of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ridker et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and others found
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V Leiden</ENAMEX>. Taken together, the studies suggest
          that polymorphisms predisposing to arterial thrombosis
          may differ from polymorphisms predisposing to deep vein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombosis</ENAMEX>. This hypothesis supports the rationale for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemostasis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>-gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> study such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX>,
          which investigates ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> specifically and does
          not regard all acute thrombotic events, whether arterial
          or venous, as a single clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX> gene controls
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> (integrin Î± 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> Î² 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ), a transmembranous heterodimer
          with several ligands, including fibrinogen, fibrin,
          fibronectin, and vWF. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are involved in
          platelet adhesion and many agonists stimulate platelet
          aggregation, but platelet aggregation requires
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIIb/IIIa</ENAMEX>. When platelets aggregate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> binds to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrinogen</ENAMEX> and vWF. Binding to vWF gains importance under
          conditions of high shear <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
          found no overall association between the P1A2
          polymorphism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> gene and cerebral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarction</ENAMEX> confirmed by computed tomography (CT).
          However, a subgroup analysis showed significant genotype
          distribution differences in nonsmokers. The risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stroke</ENAMEX> was greater in nonsmokers heterozygous for the
          P1A2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> than in those homozygous for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1A2</TIMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.37</NUMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.19</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.74</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). Information on young
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was limited ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>), but in a logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P1A</NUMEX> genotype status,
          smoking, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, the OR for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in
          those possessing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A2</TIMEX> allele was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.68</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.82</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>). This study highlights
          the need for further studies of the interaction between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and environmental factors, in this case smoking, in
          attempts to elucidate inherited stroke risk.
        
        
          Aims
          The primary aim of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> is to test the association
          between ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and the following putative risk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">factor polymorphisms: Î²-fibrinogen C148T</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G448A</TIMEX>, and
          G455A; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C807T; GPIbÎ± HPA-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIIb/IIIa</ENAMEX>
          P1A. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exploratory</ENAMEX> aims are to investigate whether any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> found between ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and the panel
          of tested polymorphisms is contingent on sex, age, ethnic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, smoking status, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke subtype</ENAMEX> and to
          investigate whether hemostatic gene sequence variations
          are associated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> functional outcome after acute
          ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Design and Overview
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> is a prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">multicenter</ENAMEX> study using a
          case-control design (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are screened at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> clinical centers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - Additional file: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), stroke status is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verified</ENAMEX>, the index stroke for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is subtyped,
          and baseline clinical and demographic data are collected.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> are collected from all enrolled patients
          and control subjects by means of a one-time venipuncture.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are shipped to a central DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> for
          processing and storage, and the processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> are
          sent to a central genetics laboratory for genotyping. The
          genotype data are then merged with the clinical, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>,
          and follow-up data and analyzed to ascertain potential

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> With <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stroke</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cases</ENAMEX>)
            Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with suspected stroke admitted to a
            participating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is evaluated by a study
            neurologist according to current standards for care [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . The evaluation includes patient history,
            physical examination, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> or magnetic resonance imaging
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, and laboratory testing. Where
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clinically</ENAMEX> indicated, the evaluation may also include
            carotid ultrasonography; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>, or digital subtraction
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiography</ENAMEX>; transthoracic or transesophageal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">echocardiography</ENAMEX>; resting and ambulatory
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrocardiography</ENAMEX>; intracranial arterial imaging; and
            additional blood testing.
            Adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who meet the following criteria
            are entered into the study: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) diagnosis of first-ever
            ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> confirmed by the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> on
            the basis of history, physical examination, and head
            imaging by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> or MR; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) enrollment within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> after
            onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> symptoms; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) attained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th birthday</TIMEX> by
            the time of enrollment; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) complete blood cell count,
            casual or fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX>, prothrombin time, and
            activated partial thromboplastin time available; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
            written informed consent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or
            surrogate.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stroke</ENAMEX> is defined according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] as rapidly developing
            signs of a focal or global disturbance of cerebral
            function with symptoms lasting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> or longer or
            leading to death, with no apparent cause other than
            vascular origin. A diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> is made
            only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has a clinical diagnosis of stroke
            and if a CT scan or MR of the brain done after onset of
            symptoms either is normal or shows the relevant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarct</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with hemorrhagic transformation of an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infarct</ENAMEX> remain eligible.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke onset</ENAMEX> is defined as the time when the
            subject was last noted to be at baseline neurologic
            status. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> awoke with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> symptoms, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of onset is taken as the last time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was
            known to be awake and without any symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>.
            We restrict enrollment to within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> after onset of
            symptoms from the first-ever stroke to avoid potential
            survival bias [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . The date of enrollment
            is the date of obtaining signed informed consent.
            Exclusion criteria parallel those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siblings</ENAMEX>
            With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ischemic Stroke Study</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
            who are already enrolled in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> are not eligible for
            participation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX>.
            To be able to assess the extent to which enrolled
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> represent all potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, clinical
            study coordinators at each site keep logs of every
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">eligible stroke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who is offered participation in
            the study, whether or not they are enrolled. The logs
            will contain initials and date of birth of the eligible
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, date of screening, sex, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">race/ethnicity.</ENAMEX>
          
          
            Controls
            Controls are adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who have attained
            their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18th</NUMEX> birthday at the time of enrollment, have not
            had a stroke, are unrelated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> to patients
            enrolled in the study, and who give written informed
            consent to participate in the study. We confirm that
            controls have not had a prior <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> by means of the
            Questionnaire for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verifying Stroke</ENAMEX>-free Status (QVSS),
            a structured interview that was validated in an adult
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> (age, > <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX>) using systematic review
            of electronic medical records as the benchmark [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSS</ENAMEX> was further validated in an independent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> using history and physical examination by a
            study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> as the benchmark [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
            Interviewers administering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSS</ENAMEX> may exclude a
            subject they judge to be an unreliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> on the
            basis of a global impression of moderate or severe
            impairment of speech, language, hearing, or memory.
            Hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> being treated for coronary or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peripheral vascular disease</ENAMEX> are not eligible for
            enrollment as controls, but nonhospitalized subjects
            with a history of these conditions are eligible.
            Cases and controls are matched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Matching
            criteria are sex and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX> for patients
            who are younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX> and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX> for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years or older</TIMEX>). We recruit
            controls mainly from among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> and unrelated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has a backup plan
            for recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community volunteers</ENAMEX> should there be a
            lag in recruitment of properly matched controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
            .
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection</ENAMEX>
          
            Structured Interview
            A structured interview is conducted by the study
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> with each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (case) or surrogate and
            each control subject to explain the study, obtain
            informed consent, and obtain standardized information
            on baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> and demographic, medical,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, and behavioral variables. Information regarding
            race and ethnicity is recorded according to
            self-report. A proband-derived family history is taken
            for all living or deceased full <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, all
            biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and both biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
            . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> do not independently verify stroke
            status of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> as part of this protocol.
            Self-reported cerebrovascular histories are obtained
            for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and control subjects by administering
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSS</ENAMEX> during the baseline interview [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX>
            Study coordinators review the medical records of the
            initial evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> cases to complete case
            report forms for documenting eligibility and baseline
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and to construct the abstracted medical record
            used for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke subtyping</ENAMEX>. The following information is
            recorded on the case report forms: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> history,
            physical examination, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> or MR of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, white blood
            cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, casual or fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX>,
            prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, and
            temperature), international normalized ratio, lipid
            profile, plasma homocysteine concentration, and size
            and location of the symptomatic cerebral infarct as
            seen on head imaging.
            The clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> also constructs the
            abstracted medical record used for subtyping of the
            index stroke by copying admission notes, physician
            progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports,
            electrocardiograms, echocardiography reports,
            laboratory reports, and rehabilitation notes.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> and coordinators use standardized
            definitions for major medical and surgical comorbid
            conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - see Additional file: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>).
            Because blood pressure typically falls during the first
            few days after an acute ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, we have
            adopted a modification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Manhattan Stroke</ENAMEX>
            Study (NOMASS) technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , in which we use the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> and diastolic blood pressure values measured
            after admission to the hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> (or intensive
            care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>) rather than measurements taken by the
            emergency medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> or in the emergency
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Blood pressure is measured from the left
            brachial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> (if attainable) with a
            sphygmomanometer, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> sitting upright. If
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is bedbound, the measurement is made with
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the bed elevated to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least a 45Â°</NUMEX>
            angle.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Characterization of Ischemic Stroke</ENAMEX>
            An on-site, study-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> confirms the
            diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> and the time of stroke
            onset by interviewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or any available
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> present when the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> was first noticed [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> seeks corroborating evidence (such
            as ambulance reports) and carefully screens for the
            possibility of onset during sleep. The severity of the
            neurologic deficit is assessed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s enrollment in the study by means of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale</ENAMEX> (NIHSS) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
            ] administered by a certified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> CT or
            MR obtained is used to measure infarct size by means of
            standardized criteria (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> - see Additional
            file: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>).
            Prestroke functional status is assessed
            retrospectively by the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> with the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oxford Handicap Scale</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Acute poststroke
            functional status is assessed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford Handicap</ENAMEX>
            Scale [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , Barthel Index [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glasgow</ENAMEX>
            Outcome Scale [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> of enrollment.
            Subtyping of the index ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> is done
            centrally on the basis of the abstracted medical record
            by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist adjudicator blinded</ENAMEX> to genotype data
            and personal indentifiers. Because final subtype
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagnosis</ENAMEX> has been shown to vary from initial diagnosis
            in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one-third</NUMEX> of cases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjudicator</ENAMEX> uses all available and relevant information
            obtained after completion of the stroke work-up. The

            Follow-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stroke</ENAMEX> Patients
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> are followed up by the study
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> from which they were
            recruited. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator reassesses patients</ENAMEX> by using

            interview the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> themselves. However, if acquired
            deficits of speech, language, or cognition prevent the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from participating in the telephone outcomes
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>, a surrogate history is taken from a

            record mortality and history of cause of death from

            high-molecular-weight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> pellet using a
            modification of the salting-out procedure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller et</ENAMEX>
            al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . Quality control studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> consist of
            estimation of quantity by <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">OD260/OD280</ENAMEX> ratio, estimation
            of integrity by gel electrophoresis and restriction
            digestion, and verification of identity by
            microsatellite analysis and sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>.
            Transformation of lymphocytes is done using
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein-Barr</ENAMEX> virus and phytohemagglutinin. Lymphocyte
            cultures are expanded to produce sufficient stock for
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 12</NUMEX> ampules. All cell cultures are done in the
            absence of antibiotics. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cryopreservation</ENAMEX> is again done
            by controlled-rate freezing. Samples are stored at the
            liquid phase of nitrogen. In-house and remote fail-safe
            stocks are generated. The following routine quality
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> studies for cell culture are performed:
            recovery of frozen stock and determination of
            viability, sterility testing for bacterial and fungal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contamination</ENAMEX>, testing for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mycoplasma</ENAMEX> contamination by
            polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and confirmation of
            the identity of the culture by comparing the DNA
            fingerprint of the culture with that of the quality
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> specimen. If the first attempt fails, a second
            aliquot of cryopreserved lymphocytes can be
            transformed.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genotyping</ENAMEX> is done at a central genetics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.
            Currently, the following sequencing methods are used,
            but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> will be responsive to technological
            advances in the field.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> is carried out in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75-Î</NUMEX>¼L volume on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-ng
            genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by use of plain primers under standard
            conditions with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57Â°</NUMEX> to 52Â°C (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.5Â°C/cycle</ENAMEX>)
            "touch-down" annealing temperature. To remove excess
            unincorporated primers that would compete as sequencing
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> in the cycle sequencing reaction, the amplified
            product is filtered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MultiScreen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PCR</ENAMEX> filters
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore</ENAMEX>) and resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼L</NUMEX>. The sequencing
            reaction is carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BigDye Terminator</ENAMEX>
            cycle sequencing kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>) as per the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s conditions. To remove excess dye
            terminators, the sequencing product is purified by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol precipitation</ENAMEX> and resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼L</NUMEX> of HiDi
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formamide</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are then denatured and
            electrophoresed on an ABI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3100</TIMEX> capillary analyzer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
            analysis is carried out with a software <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> (ABI)
            consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing Analysis</ENAMEX> (base calling),
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Factura</ENAMEX> (heterozygous base detection), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequence</ENAMEX>

            Adverse Events
            All adverse events and serious adverse events will
            be recorded by the study coordinators and forwarded to
            the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Potential physical risks are
            minimal and relate to the one-time phlebotomy. An
            independent medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">safety monitor</ENAMEX> will review summary
            reports of adverse events and serious adverse events
            periodically and will forward assessments to the study

          Outcome Measures
          The main end point of the study is whether any of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> (the Î²-fibrinogen polymorphisms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C148T</TIMEX>,
          G448A, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G455A</ENAMEX> and the platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GP</ENAMEX> polymorphisms GPIa
          C807T, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIbÎ±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPA-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIIb/IIIa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1A</ENAMEX>) are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          stroke will be compared with controls as to frequency and
          distribution of these polymorphisms. Other end points
          include potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> among these polymorphisms
          and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtypes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>, ethnic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> poststroke functional outcome and
          mortality. Additional analyses will include testing for
          interactions between inherited susceptibility (genotype)
          and environmental exposures (e.g., smoking).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analyses</ENAMEX>
          Several types of analyses will be performed to assess
          the relationships between outcome (binary and continuous)
          and risk factors (both genetic and environmental). The
          statistical techniques we use to analyze the data depend
          on the distribution of the independent (predictor) and
          dependent (outcome) variables. When the outcome variables
          are categorical (i.e., stroke [yes/no]) we will use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> tests and logistic regression techniques; when
          the outcome variables are continuous (with or without
          inclusion of collected longitudinal data), we will use
          repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
          techniques.
          Cases will be compared with controls with respect to
          predictor variables of interest and with respect to
          genotypes that may provide increased risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>.
          Where needed, adjustments for potential covariates (age,
          sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, etc.) will also be included in these
          analyses. To perform the above comparisons, we will use
          logistic regression, a statistical technique for modeling
          the relationship of a binary outcome and a set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independent</ENAMEX> (or predictor) variables [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] .
          For our case-control comparisons, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> series of
          analyses relates to the distribution of polymorphisms
          within the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes in the cases (stroke
          positive) and controls (stroke negative). Each subject
          will be characterized by the polymorphism (or mutation)
          found at each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene. Different analytical
          strategies need to be employed for the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate loci</ENAMEX> under study. For the fibrinogen gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX>, it is proposed that the genotype be considered
          as a binary variable, that is, as a single nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> (SNP) with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible alleles, since the
          outcome of polymorphisms in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of this cluster has
          resulted in apparent increased risk for ischemic heart
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> through increased circulating fibrinogen levels.
          Thus, initial analyses using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the fibrinogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> (or with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIbÎ±</ENAMEX>)
          will focus on each case/control being classified by the
          presence of a risk allele (yes/no), with comparison of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> allele frequencies between groups
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>/control).
          For other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIbÎ±</ENAMEX>, etc.), distributions
          of genotypes or strata determined by alleles or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> can be established for comparison. For
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPIbÎ±</ENAMEX> has a series of polymorphisms that may
          define an allele of interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Extending SNPs</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX> has the advantage of increased information,
          yet decreased power in small samples due to the increased
          number of possible haplotypes to be tested. Restriction
          of haplotypes by "binning" may provide some increase in
          power, yet it assumes previous knowledge of risk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplotypes</ENAMEX>. These few haplotypes can be used to establish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strata</ENAMEX> in the analyses proposed. In separate analyses,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX>/polymorphism status can be considered to be an
          exposure variable. Thus, risk factor distributions can be
          compared between "exposed" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (with a polymorphism
          in a candidate gene) and those "not exposed" (without a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX>). For levels of continuous risk factors,
          this analysis will compare means by analysis of variance
          methods. For dichotomous risk factors, contingency table
          methods can be used.
          In the case-control analyses, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> locus can
          be analyzed individually as a potential modifier of
          disease risk (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>) and as a determinant of other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> (continuous trait) end points. To evaluate
          the relationships between gene interaction (gene-gene)
          and interaction between inherited susceptibility
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">genotype</NUMEX>) and environmental exposures (e.g.,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> or smoking), several strategies can be
          employed. One approach is stratification by genotype at
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> locus, with analysis of "case" status with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> genetic (or environmental) exposure. For
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dichotomous</ENAMEX> exposures, this reduces to a comparison of
          contingency tables within genotype strata.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> approach uses logistic regression. Logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> can be used for continuous risk factors within
          genotype strata. Similarly, multivariate logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> can be used to predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> membership
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> vs. control) based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, sex, environmental
          risk factors that appear significant in univariate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, and genotype(s), with first-order interaction
          terms of genotype with environment and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene 1</ENAMEX> with gene
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Sample Size and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study Power</ENAMEX>
          We intend to enroll a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>,
          including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> (cases) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> stroke-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> (controls), at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> academic
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX>.
          Estimates of potential for recruitment were based on the
          assumption that the rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hospitalized stroke</ENAMEX> cases at
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> will remain at 1999
          levels throughout the patient recruitment phase of the
          study.
          We anticipate that the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will be
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> white and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, giving sample sizes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 300</NUMEX> each
          for white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> each for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Thus, for the above analyses, we are
          concerned primarily with dichotomous outcomes with fixed
          sample sizes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100, 300</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> stroke cases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300,</ENAMEX>
          or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> controls). Power for any analyses involving
          continuous measures can be approximated using an
          independent 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test comparison between the
          incident cases and controls. In the case-control study,
          the power to address specific issues relating to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic associations</ENAMEX> is dependent on the sample size
          available, the frequency of the polymorphisms (in the
          fibrinogen cluster and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes), and the
          size of the effect to be detected.
          The power is determined on the basis of the frequency
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the detectable
          difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> allele frequency in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          For example, if an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> has a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.40</NUMEX> in the
          total group of controls ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX>), we can detect (with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>
          power) a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> difference in cases [(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.20</NUMEX>)(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.40</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>] or
          frequencies greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.48</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 0.32</NUMEX> in cases.
          This is obviously a small difference (or a relatively
          weak genetic relative risk). Using this same example, we
          would have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> power in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> power in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we generally
          have power for relatively high-frequency polymorphisms in
          controls (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 45%-50%</NUMEX>) and detectable
          differences of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> in cases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX> difference). Thus, we
          could detect an SNP allele frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.70</NUMEX> in cases and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.45</NUMEX> in controls with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> power.
          In general, the power to detect gene-environment
          interaction effects is less than that for main effects
          and is dependent on the type of interaction. For example,
          using methods discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , the power to
          detect interactions for multiple scenarios is possible.
          For these scenarios, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Ã 2</ENAMEX> tables can be used to describe
          the overall main effects of genetic and environmental
          risks (i.e., both the genetic and the environmental risk
          factors display a main effect size [odds ratio] of about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          For large interactions we have > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> statistical
          power. Only in the smallest subgroup would power be
          appreciably affected. For example, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> cases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> controls), with the
          same distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> as above, the power to
          detect the large interactions (OR of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.33</NUMEX> in controls, OR
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.33</NUMEX> in cases) would still be ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>, while the power to
          detect the modest interaction (OR of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.80</NUMEX> in controls, OR
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.50</NUMEX> in cases) would be reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Ethical Considerations
        Local institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review boards</ENAMEX> (IRBs) governing each
        clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> have approved the study protocol. Written
        informed consent is obtained for every study subject. To
        the extent permitted by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRBs</ENAMEX>, surrogate consent is
        permitted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> rendered incompetent by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> to
        avoid biasing the study toward discovery of risk factors
        for mild or moderate stroke but not severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>.
        Genetic information has the potential to adversely
        affect insurability and employability [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] . An
        individual's genetic information could also lead to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stigmatization</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
        Because of the highly sensitive nature of genetic
        information, we have developed the following plan to
        prevent intentional or unintentional misuse of genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, which is in keeping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Privacy Workshop</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning Subcommittee Guidelines of the National Action</ENAMEX>
        Plan on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast Cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] .
        Every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> who obtains or has access to
        genotypic data is blinded to individual personal
        identifiers, and every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> who obtains or has
        access to individual personal identifiers is blinded to
        genotypic data. Personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">identifiers</ENAMEX> are defined as
        individual names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers,
        and e-mail addresses. Personal identifiers and linkage
        codes are kept only at the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> where the study
        subject was enrolled and will not be recorded on case
        report forms or stored in the study electronic database.
        Experimental research data are not placed in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">participant</ENAMEX>'s medical record. There have been various
        opinions regarding whether family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> should be
        considered human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in pedigree research and when it
        is permissible to waive consent [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 47 48 49</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX>,
        no personal identifiers are collected on family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        The protocol of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> calls for centrally banking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        creating immortalized cell lines. Unlike the situation in
        clinical trial research, no broad consensus on research
        ethics exists among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> and eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        in the field of human molecular genetics research. Of
        recent contention are procedures for ensuring ethical
        future use of stored genetic material [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51</NUMEX> ] . The
        potential for future use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> should be anticipated, even
        if the specific studies cannot be known. A future-use
        agreement should respect genetic privacy rights and
        autonomy of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> while encouraging scientific
        inquiry. Establishing a transparent and ethically sound
        future-use agreement for research in this field facilitates
        multicenter collaborations and future research. After
        reviewing available policy statements from genetics
        societies and governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, we developed the
        following list of key principles, which are incorporated
        into a future-use agreement governing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA banked</ENAMEX> for this
        study: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> must provide informed consent to the
        original study at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> collection. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The
        original study must have a rigorous procedure in place to
        protect privacy of study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> collection.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> should have the option to consent to, or
        refrain from, participation in future research at the time
        of the initial consent process. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) Levels of consent must
        be clear, explicit, and exclusive (e.g., original study
        only, any <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> study, any study). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) Applications for
        future use need to be reviewed formally. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) Study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> can release <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for future use only after
        determining whether the new study conforms to the type of
        research permitted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) All specimens are
        stripped of direct personal identifiers before future use.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) Anonymous data sets with genetic information from
        different studies may be merged for hypothesis-generating
        analyses. We believe that this carefully developed,
        publicly scrutinized future-use agreement is a unique
        strength of this study and hope that this proactive
        approach will avoid some of the rancorous misunderstandings
        that other investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have encountered in genetic
        and pedigree research [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Discussion
        Defining the molecular basis for the inherited component
        to ischemic stroke risk will require converging lines of
        evidence from various methodologies, including genomewide
        screens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene association studies.
        Collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from a large cohort of ischemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke pedigrees</ENAMEX> is logistically challenging. Collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and unrelated
        stroke-free controls is more feasible.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke genetics</ENAMEX> research has been done in the
        context of epidemiological studies; for example, a study by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ridker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] tested for an association
        between factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V Leiden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. One limitation of this
        approach is that there may be relatively few stroke end
        points in an epidemiological study, particularly because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, myocardial infarction, and vascular death are often
        combined as the primary end point. Furthermore, for various
        reasons, epidemiological studies may include a selected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, for example, only one sex or a limited
        socioeconomic stratum. The use of such highly selected
        samples may compromise the ability to generalize the
        findings of a genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> study.
        Genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> can be studied within the context of
        a clinical trial of an intervention for primary prevention.
        In a prevention study, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> would be available both from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>-free controls, but the
        intervention may alter the outcome (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>) sufficiently to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confound</ENAMEX> interpretation of the results of a genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> study.
        A genetic study in the context of a randomized trial of
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is a robust study design when
        the goal is to discover genetic determinants of stroke
        outcome or response to therapy (pharmacogenomics). However,
        such a study design may not achieve the goal of discovering
        genetic risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> because no genetic material
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>-free controls outside of the study would be
        available. Furthermore, highly restrictive criteria for
        eligibility into a clinical trial can drastically limit the
        representativeness of a study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For example, in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study of intra-arterial thrombolysis for treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,323</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screened</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 180</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were selected [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> studies include only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with nondisabling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] , or include only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with moderate to
        severe strokes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> is a dedicated stroke
        genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> study, it has broad eligibility
        criteria relative to clinical trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> or devices.
        We expect this to enhance the external validity of the
        results of the study.
        Additionally, we have given careful attention to
        appropriate selection of controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The controls are
        concurrently enrolled at the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> as are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and controls are also screened for a medical
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> or transient ischemic attack and for the
        presence of symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> or transient ischemic attack
        which may have occurred in the absence of a corresponding
        medical history.
        A unique strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> is that the protocol was
        specifically developed to permit valid future pooled
        analyses with the ongoing affected sibling pair linkage
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 53</NUMEX> ] , which uses genome-wide screening
        within a cohort of pedigrees to identify chromosomal
        regions - rather than specific polymorphisms - that are
        linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. Conducting a candidate gene association
        study in cases and controls has advantages compared with
        the genome-wide linkage approach in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>. Isolated
        cases are more likely to be available than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sibling</NUMEX> pairs,
        increasing the potential for statistical power.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of phenotype is often
        retrospective in genome-wide linkage studies because it is
        rarely possible to enroll all affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
        pedigree shortly after onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the
        case-control approach allows prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotyping</ENAMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at the time of onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, which may be more
        reliable than retrospective phenotyping. This is an
        advantage because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> has a heterogeneous
        phenotype, and distinctions between specific clinical
        subtypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> may be relevant [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . To
        address the heterogeneity of the ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke phenotype</ENAMEX>,
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> is subtyped by a genotype-blinded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjudicator</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> also use the same definitions for
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and comorbidity and the same criteria for
        classifying stroke mechanism. Both studies use the same key
        exclusion criteria; for example, both studies exclude
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iatrogenic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasospastic ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
        exclude the same mendelian and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mitochondrial disorders</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>-free status of controls in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISGS</ENAMEX> and of
        discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> is verified using the same
        structured interview instrument (i.e., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ).
        We anticipate that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies will complement each
        other in contributing to the broad, long-term objective of
        defining the molecular basis for inherited ischemic stroke
        risk.
