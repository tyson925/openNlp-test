          The experimental system
          The design of the evolution experiment has been
          described elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In short, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> lines were
          derived from a single, strictly asexual clone of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> B that has been in the
          laboratory for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several decades</TIMEX> (see:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://myxo.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">css</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">msu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/ecoli/strainsource.</ENAMEX>htmlfor more
          information). The strain is prototrophic (it can
          synthesize all components of a cell from a single energy
          source, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, and inorganic salts, nitrogen,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) and has undoubtedly undergone some general
          adaptation to the laboratory environment, but has not
          been selected under any specific conditions like the
          evolution protocol (prolonged serial transfer in minimal
          medium). A spontaneous mutant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ancestor</ENAMEX> capable of
          using arabinose (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX> +) was used to found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the
          replicates, whereas the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> were founded with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX> -ancestor. This trait can be used to distinguish
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> on indicator plates and is neutral in
          the selective environment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are
          maintained by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> transfer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> ml of culture
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.9</NUMEX> ml of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> minimal media supplemented
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DM25</NUMEX>). These conditions allow
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 7cells/ml at stationary phase. Every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">generations</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75 days</TIMEX>), samples of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were
          stored in a glycerol suspension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>.
          The bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that are the focus of this
          study have been well studied [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ]
          . A brief review of the relevant observations follows.
          First, each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> has adapted to growth in a
          serially diluted, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX>, environment of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>-limited minimal media [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> of adaptation are well known: after a period of
          rapid adaptation during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, the
          rate of improvement has subsequently slowed to almost
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-thirtieth of the initial rate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 27</NUMEX> ] . Moreover,
          relatively few mutations generated this early, rapid
          adaptation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 24</NUMEX> ] . Thus, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have
          experienced two types of dynamics: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of rapid
          adaptation followed by one of much slower improvement.
          Nonetheless, this gradual adaptation contributed
          significantly to the mean fitness relative to the
          ancestor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1.7</NUMEX> by generation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travisano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenski</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] demonstrated that
          adaptations specific to growth on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> were partly
          responsible for the initial fitness improvements. They
          found that evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> tended to outcompete the
          ancestor on substrates that share membrane transport
          pathways with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, but were inferior on substrates
          that did not. To assess the longer-term consequences of
          these adaptations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenski</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] employed
          Biologâ„¢ plates, which are microtiter plates containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>
          different carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and an indicator dye that
          reflects the amount of respiration on each substrate.
          Sampling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clones per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> after generations
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found that average
          performance on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> informative, foreign substrates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decayed</ENAMEX> significantly over time. The primary objective of
          this study was to deduce which of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanisms</ENAMEX>, antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>, was more responsible for specialization
          (results were strongly in favor of antagonistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pleiotropy</ENAMEX>). However, this experiment also approximated
          the evolution of one aspect of the 
          fundamental niche , diet breadth,
          in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] continued this line of research
          by studying the evolution of thermal niche in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, which are maintained at a constant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Maximum growth rate, which has been shown to be the
          primary determinant of fitness in this system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ,
          was measured across a range of temperatures (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-42Â°C</TIMEX>)
          over evolutionary time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found a surprising
          amount of correlated adaptation to "moderate"
          temperatures surrounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, suggesting that selection
          at this temperature had favored mutations that also
          improved performance at (presumably) physiologically
          similar temperatures. However, mean performance at
          "extreme" temperatures (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20Â°C, >40Â°C</ENAMEX>) decreased over
          evolutionary time, with several evolved clones failing to
          grow at these temperatures. Judging the effect of this
          laboratory evolution on the thermal niche of these
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> therefore depends on one's
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>. Mean growth at extreme temperatures tended
          to decrease, but mean growth rates across a range of
          moderate temperatures actually increased over time.
          In summary, the functionality of these evolved 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> under certain
          conditions has been compromised by long-term adaptation
          to a single-resource, single-temperature environment. Yet
          most of these experiments have approximated the
          fundamental niche by examining each clone in isolation
          from its ancestor and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. By
          comparison, measuring the realized niche requires a
          head-to-head test of fitness with the ancestor. After a
          survey of diet breadth using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biolog</ENAMEX> plates, this study
          focuses on a series of direct competitions between
          evolved isolates from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> and the ancestor
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> foreign environments. Assays of individual
          functions and whole-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> fitness are clearly quite
          different, but it is the latter, poorly measured property
          that ultimately determines both evolutionary success and
          the tangible dimensions of the niche.
        
        
          Experimental design
          These experiments focus only on isolates from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> and their common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> clones from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were picked
          randomly from platings of these cultures and frozen
          separately; each experiment therefore compares <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> clones
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> clones) with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ancestors (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX>
          -and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX> +). I studied multiple clones from each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> because there are within-population
          polymorphisms that may be associated with functional
          differences [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] .
          The environments are described as follows. First, I
          both increased and decreased the concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> is standard) in the evolutionary
          medium in order to test the specificity of adaptation to
          the environment. I hypothesized that adaptation to a
          particular concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> in the medium might
          reduce competitive ability at either lower (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) or
          higher (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) concentrations, perhaps because of
          tradeoffs between resource affinity and maximum growth
          rate. Next, I added bile salts, which are organic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX> that are lethal to most non-enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          to the standard experimental medium. Tolerance to bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salts</ENAMEX> is a characteristic that has been used to define
          enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, which is shared by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX> in this experiment. In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , it has been established
          that bile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> may traverse the outer membrane through
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OmpF</ENAMEX> porin, which is the same porin through which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> passes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . If selection for improved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          transport resulted in a greater number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OmpF</ENAMEX> porins
          relative to the more bile-resistant, smaller-channel OmpC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">porin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] , for example, it is possible that
          tolerance to bile salts was compromised as the
          populations evolved. As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> test of the effect of
          selection on the outer membrane, I measured the
          resistance to the antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">novobiocin</ENAMEX> of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. While novobiocin acts primarily as a DNA
          gyrase inhibitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is mediated by the
          concentration of phospholipids in the outer membrane, for
          which the 
          cls <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (encoding cardiolipin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX>) is partly responsible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Again, if
          selection had increased membrane permeability,
          sensitivity to novobiocin might have increased relative
          to the partially resistant ancestor.
          I chose the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Luria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>) environment because its
          nutrients are so different from the selection medium, but
          other conditions remain the same (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">e.g.</ENAMEX> culture vessel,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, and serial transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LB</ENAMEX> media
          consists of tryptone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> extract (which is the
          water-soluble portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autolyzed yeast</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>. In
          short, it is a complex of nutrients largely devoid of
          simple carbohydrates like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. The LB environment was
          diluted with distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to generate comparable cell
          density with the standard selective environment. For each
          competition in a foreign environment, fitness was also
          simultaneously measured in the standard medium for a
          direct reference.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Diet breadth narrows
          Consistent with a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , I found a
          significant decline in diet breadth of an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>
          for all evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, one sampled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test, t = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.49</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>). This decline in
          diet breadth proved to be general and not limited to a
          few substrates; on average, evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> tended to
          perform worse than the ancestor. There was no significant
          variation among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in the sum of all catabolic
          functions, but there was significant variation among
          clones within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A single
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>" clone in population <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-5</ENAMEX> that grew less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> as well as the ancestor on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> substrates caused
          much of this effect, but this clone was otherwise normal
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. Another "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>" clone that was
          abnormally deficient on fewer substrates was also found
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> A+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. These clones were not better or worse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> than other clones in the evolution
          environment because of their reduced functionality,
          however (data not shown). If these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> outlying clones
          are omitted from the nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> of diet breadth, then
          significant variation exists among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (F 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 22</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.34</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.043</NUMEX>) but no longer
          among clones within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,34</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.957</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.534</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Fitness improved in foreign environments
          I evaluated diet breadth in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, contrasting
          manner by competing clones from evolved populations
          directly against the ancestor in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> foreign
          environments. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiment, I measured
          competitive fitness versus the ancestor over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold
          range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose concentrations</ENAMEX> in the otherwise standard
          experimental environment. Clones were competed in two
          "test" environments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DM2.5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DM250</ENAMEX>) as well as in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> environment (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DM25</NUMEX>). I found a significant effect
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> concentration on population mean fitness
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Populations</ENAMEX> (and clones within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>)
          also varied significantly in their performances at
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose concentrations</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by the
          significant interaction terms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
          Not surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were most fit in the DM25
          environment in which they evolved (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; t-tests for
          paired comparisons: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DM2.5</NUMEX> vs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DM25</TIMEX>, t 
          s = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.48</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>, DM25
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">vs. DM250</ENAMEX>, t 
          s = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.08</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>).
          However, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were more fit than the ancestor
          in both DM2.5 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DM250</TIMEX>; that is, adaptation to the DM25
          environment brought about correlated improvements in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitness</ENAMEX>, rather than tradeoffs, at other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were
          uniformly more fit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DM2.5</ENAMEX> environment than in the
          DM250 environment (paired t-test, t 
          s = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.37</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>).
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> experiment, I evaluated the effect of
          adding bile salts to the experimental medium (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> performed nearly equivalently
          with or without bile salts, relative to the ancestor
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-tailed paired t 
          s = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.10</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.138</NUMEX>). A nested
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> on the fitness data in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DM25</NUMEX> + bile salts did reveal
          marginally significant variation among and within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). A single clone from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> A-5
          caused nearly all of this variation within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>;
          this same clone was also deficient on numerous carbon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biolog</ENAMEX> plates. When I omitted this clone from
          the nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, there was more significant variation
          among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for fitness in bile salts (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,22</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.615</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.026</NUMEX>) but not among
          clones within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,34</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.718</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.790</NUMEX>)
          In the final experiment, I altered the competitive
          environment in a more pronounced manner by using a much
          more complex medium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX>, instead of minimal salts
          supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. I anticipated the greatest
          difference in fitness between this environment and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Indeed, mean fitness in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> was significantly
          lower than that in the control environment (paired
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test, t 
          s = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.278</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">df</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>).
          However, it was surprising that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
          had nevertheless increased in fitness in LB relative to
          the ancestor, and that the fitness of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> population
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A-1</NUMEX>) was statistically indistinguishable when grown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DM25</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). On the other hand, three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were statistically equivalent to the ancestor
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> fitness (i.e. the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals of these
          means (not shown) did not exclude the ancestral fitness,
          which equals <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>). In addition, a nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fitness in LB</ENAMEX> revealed highly significant variation among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> but not within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> become sensitive to
          novobiocin
          Assays that examined the ability of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to
          grow on agar plates containing novobiocin demonstrated
          that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> became sensitive to this antibiotic
          (not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were completely
          sensitive to the antibiotic; no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were observed
          for any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clones tested per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) retained a level of
          resistance comparable to that of the ancestor, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ara-3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) were intermediately
          sensitive.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spiegelman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] asked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bacteriophage QÎ²</ENAMEX> only to "go forth and replicate" in the
        medium containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">QÎ² replicase</ENAMEX>, and numerous functions were
        lost. We have issued a similar injunction to these 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, except in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and minimal salts medium. Following this precedent,
        these long-term evolving 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> should have
        become streamlined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose scavengers</ENAMEX> and evolved a
        substantially reduced niche. This was not the case, at
        least not nearly to the extent observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QÎ²</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX>
        absolute catabolic loss (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-ribose) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] was observed in
        all twelve lineages, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional function
        (resistance to novobiocin) was lost in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> performed no worse on average than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX> in most functions assayed, and the significant
        losses that were found tended to be small in absolute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magnitude</ENAMEX> (not shown, see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ).
        Nonetheless, the fundamental niche approximated by
        Biolog plates declined by an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, and no
        systematic gains in function occurred that might have
        compensated for other losses of function. In these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, specialization did not involve numerous
        wholesale losses of function, but rather reduced
        performance on many substrates not used during the
        evolution experiment. The degree of decay varied both among
        and within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for growth on different substrates
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and a substantial amount of functional decay
        occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> clones sampled. Thus, the
        fundamental catabolic niche of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> became
        narrower while adapting to this simple laboratory
        environment.
        However, I arrived at a strikingly different conclusion
        when I measured the relative fitness, which is analogous to
        the realized niche, of the evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        different foreign environments. In these assays,
        performance was quantified by directly competing the
        evolved genotypes with the ancestors, and in nearly every
        case the evolved genotype was the superior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>.
        These correlated improvements in fitness in novel
        environments suggest that adaptation to the laboratory
        environment was nonspecific and multifaceted, and seem to
        downplay the significance of the compromised fundamental
        niche.
        Each of these novel environments was not entirely
        foreign to the evolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, however. Though glucose
        concentration was both raised and lowered tenfold,
        conditions remained otherwise identical to those of the
        evolution experiment. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were clearly
        superior at the lower concentration, which, in hindsight,
        likely results from their familiarity with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        level. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> concentration in the experimental
        medium drops below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml as the population grows,
        competitive ability at lower concentrations was likely
        favored, even if only briefly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Yet the mechanism
        behind the greater fitness gains in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml than in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ml glucose</ENAMEX> need not be the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose concentration</ENAMEX> itself.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasi et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] argued that selection in these lines for
        improved resource affinity at low concentrations was weak,
        which perhaps implicates some other factor in the medium
        (oxygen concentration, different concentrations of
        metabolic by-products, toxicity of increased nutrients,
        etc) as the cause of the lesser fitness gains in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>.
        Bile salts are an important component of the natural
        environment of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , so much so that resistance
        to these compounds is often used to define enteric bacteria
        in microbiological assays. Bile salts are like novobiocin
        in that both are antibiotics that interact with the outer
        membrane, but their mechanisms of interaction and their
        effects on these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are rather different. Most
        populations completely lost the ability to grow in the
        presence of novobiocin, which suggests an increase in
        membrane permeability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . However, no significant
        differences in fitness were found when bile salts were
        added to the selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, indicating that the
        mechanisms of increased outer membrane permeability were
        not detrimental to bile resistance. This may reflect an
        ability of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> to actively export bile salts
        that was unaffected by this experiment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Thus, if
        changes in membrane permeability (perhaps through modified
        expression of genes like 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cls</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] ) were responsible for the
        loss of novobiocin resistance, they apparently had specific
        effects that did not compromise other membrane traits like
        tolerance to bile salts. Experiments are underway to
        establish the mechanism that links adaptation, increased
        membrane permeability, and increased novobiocin
        sensitivity.
        I found no systematic cost of adaptation to the simple
        laboratory environment when I modified the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        concentration or added bile salts, but rather found
        correlated improvements in fitness that were sometimes
        nearly equivalent to the direct adaptation. The simple
        explanation is that each of these environments differed by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> factor from the minimal medium in which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have evolved. However, the complex LB
        environment is certainly different enough from minimal
        glucose medium that any improvements in fitness in the LB
        environment are surprising. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> interpretation of all of
        the correlated adaptations in novel environments is that
        natural selection favored beneficial mutations that are
        unaffected by the nutrient medium itself. Whereas I altered
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and media composition, I did not change
        other conditions like the speed of shaking (aeration),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, or the batch culture protocol. Perhaps more
        significantly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> remained sheltered from the
        potential onslaught of competing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and predatory
        viruses, which could conceivably drastically alter their
        performance. It is likely that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> have
        adapted in part to several of components of the
        feast-and-famine, minimal, laboratory environment, and
        changing only one of them may not affect the superiority of
        other genetic adaptations. Thus, detecting "adaptive decay"
        may require more dramatic modifications to the
        environment.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, these evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, by acquiring
        mutations that were beneficial under several environmental
        conditions, expanded the niche they could potentially
        realize. More specifically, mutations that improved fitness
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 Î</TIMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> may have also improved fitness in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ml glucose</ENAMEX> (because of the common resource) as well as
        in dilute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX> (because of the equivalent cell density
        allowed by the medium). The same genotypes examined here
        were also tested in undiluted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LB</ENAMEX>, which is a medium that is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 100</NUMEX>-fold more concentrated. More losses of fitness
        were found, which suggests some specialization based on
        resource concentration, but replicates of the same genotype
        were too inconsistent to be considered reliable (V.S.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooper</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). In general, these competitions
        in novel environments suggest that mutations that were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> in the selective environment may sometimes have
        positive pleiotropic effects.
        These contrasting conclusions about how the niche of
        these bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> has evolved may actually be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconciled</ENAMEX> if we consider the potential mechanisms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">adaptation -</ENAMEX> in fact, they might inform our hunt for them
        as well. The contrary findings of novobiocin sensitivity
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bile salt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> have already been presented, but
        these results, along with other catabolic phenotypes,
        potentially limit the gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> upon which selection
        may have acted to improve life in a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>-limited
        environment. The fact that evolved clones appear to respire
        several resources poorly, yet are at least as fit as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestor</ENAMEX> in the diverse LB environment, suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enhancements</ENAMEX> in the general growth potential of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> may compensate for these deficiencies. This
        argues indirectly that the mutations responsible for
        reduced 
        fundamental diet breadth are either
        completely silent in environments similar to the evolution
        model, or are in fact beneficial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        The expansion of the potential niche of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> into different media formulations is indeed
        remarkable, but should not be construed as an evolutionary
        trend towards generalism. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travisano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenski</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ]
        demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of evolution was
        sufficient for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> to lose fitness when grown
        on alternative sugars, and the reductions in maximum growth
        rate at extreme temperatures suggest a trend towards
        specialization in thermal niche [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Together, these
        investigations of the correlated responses to adaptation to
        a specific environment demonstrate the mismatch between the
        arbitrary scales that we use to measure performance and
        real biological alternatives. Genetic variation need not
        project phenotypes along a Celsius scale or among an
        assortment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. As a result, generalizations
        about the nature of the evolution of specialization, and
        the clarification of the "folk wisdom," may elude us until
        the mechanisms and tendencies of evolutionary change are
        better revealed. Thus, despite the inclination to add
        complexity to these microbial environments so as to better
        simulate "the real world," it remains evident that we as
        evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticists</ENAMEX> still have our hands full.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Measurement of diet breadth
          Following closely the protocol described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenski</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , I used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Biolog Â®ES</ENAMEX> (designed for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella spp</ENAMEX>.) microtiter plates
          to obtain estimates of catabolic diet breadth. These
          plates have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> different carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and a tetrazolium
          indicator <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dye</ENAMEX> whose intensity is proportional to the
          amount of respiration on that substrate. I measured
          optical density immediately after inoculation and then
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of incubation; the difference in these
          figures, less the reading from the blank well, estimated
          functionality on each resource. Diet breadth is expressed
          as the average performance, relative to the ancestor, on
          all foreign resources. Mathematical transformations
          required to generate this average are described in detail
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenski</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Experiments were conducted
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complete blocks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> evolved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-generation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> clones) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ancestral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 ancestors Ã— 3 replicates</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Competition in foreign environments
          All experiments were conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ml Erlenmeyer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flasks</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> shaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX>, conditions identical
          to the long-term evolutionary environment (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] for
          specific culture conditions). Cultures were founded from
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80Â°</NUMEX> freezer isolates and grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> minimal (DM)
          medium supplemented with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1000 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>. Cultures
          were then acclimated to the test environment via a
          1/4,000 dilution into fresh medium and incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> Each evolved genotype and the ancestor of the opposite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara marker</ENAMEX> were each diluted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/200</NUMEX> into a common flask
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.9</NUMEX> ml of the test media, and then incubated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          day. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Certain</ENAMEX> clones generated unusually low yields in
          the LB environment, so competitions were founded with a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:1</TIMEX> starting ratio of evolved to ancestral genotypes,
          rather than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the typical 1:1.</TIMEX> All other details of
          competitions involving these clones were unchanged.)
          Initial and final densities of each competition culture
          were determined by plating aliquots onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> indicator
          plates, which allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX> -and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> to be
          distinguished by their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> color. Relative fitness was
          quantified by calculating the ratio of the number of
          doublings for the derived and ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> (see
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] for details). Competition experiments versus the
          ancestor were conducted in two complete blocks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          evolved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> clones (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clones</ENAMEX>) in each foreign environment and the paired
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DM25</ENAMEX> environment. The concentration for the bile
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> treatment was selected to mimic the concentration of
          bile salts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MacConkey Agar</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/L</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX> Bile
          Salts, consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> sodium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deoxycholate</ENAMEX>), which is typically used to identify
          enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
          For each competition experiment I conducted one or
          more of the following statistical tests using SPSS
          version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a nested ANOVA
          on the fitness data in the novel environment designed to
          identify significant population- and clone-level variance
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and clone are random factors); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a
          mixed-model nested ANOVA designed to identify the effect
          of environment (fixed factor) on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and
          clone-level variance (both random factors); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) a
          paired t-test to differentiate fitness in each
          experimental environment relative to control. In
          addition, I inspected the data for potential outlier
          clones within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that caused significant effects
          at the level of clone. I identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clone from one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> (A + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, clone A) that was an outlier in nearly
          all environments (novel and control). Given that it was
          also inferior in the control environment, this clone was
          omitted and analyses <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> were recalculated.
        
        
          Assay for novobiocin sensitivity
          Novobiocin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is an ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> that
          is sometimes dependent upon mutations in the cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">envelope</ENAMEX>, including the structural component
          lipopolysaccarides as well as outer membrane porins [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          ] . Assays were conducted by distributing approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> cells on LB plates containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 Î¼g/ml novobiocin.</ENAMEX>
          Replicates of the ancestors produced an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> emerged after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, the evolved clone was deemed to be sensitive.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> clones for each of the twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assayed</ENAMEX> in this manner and replicated twice each.
