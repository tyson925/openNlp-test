        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delirium</ENAMEX> is not a disease in itself, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> of
        acute cerebral inefficiency affecting the brain in various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>. It creates a deleterious effect on cognitive
        functions such as consciousness, orientation, perception,
        attention, short-term memory, judgment and abstract
        thinking [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delirium</ENAMEX> is a temporary condition, which
        can occur suddenly or slowly over a period of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> or
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. A single episode lasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 1 week</TIMEX>. The symptoms may
        be so slight they go unnoticed or so serious they could be
        life threatening. The clinical signs of delirium are
        changeable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>, and are usually more serious during
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning or night</TIMEX>. Temporary changes in clinical signs
        are important characteristics of delirium. While the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> may appear well and communicative during an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, changes in orientation could occur a few
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> later [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 3</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delirium</ENAMEX> is typically an indicator
        of a physical pathology and a worsening prognosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 4,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. It is commonly unrecognized or misdiagnosed by
        physicians treating critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misdiagnosis</ENAMEX> has been reported as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32-67%</NUMEX> in various reviews
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Clinical evaluation is the most important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> and electroencephalography is the most useful
        test for diagnosis.
        Although delirium can be experienced in all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        it has an increased frequency at more advanced ages [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. Risk factors determined for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> include: age [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>], imbalance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electrolyte</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 7, 10</ENAMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotension</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 7</ENAMEX>], hyperglycemia [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 7, 8</ENAMEX>], azotemia [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 12</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>/hypothermia and infections [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 7, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>], use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and withdrawal of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>], male sex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>], severe diseases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, cerebrovasculary or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiopulmonary disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX> and burn [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 5, 7,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 15, 16, 17, 18</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have been operated on and
        kept in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19</TIMEX>], and
        psychosocial environment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 3, 5, 20</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore,
        subclinical cerebral damage, increased adenylate cyclase in
        the central nervous system, and nutritional status
        identified by albumin level are predisposing factors for
        postoperative delirium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Interleukin-2, monoclonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and ifosfamide have also been suspected recently
        as factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The aim of the present study was to
        confirm and/or determine predisposing factors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between January 1996 and 1997</TIMEX>, we screened prospectively
        for delirium <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">818</NUMEX> consecutive general surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicle-University Hospital</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, whether
        hospitalized for elective or emergency services, or whether
        treated with medication or surgery, were kept for a period
        of time in our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICU</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        staff work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> beds
        with continuous non-invasive monitoring and ventilators.
        There are windows in the bed areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. Trained
        clinician-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> carried out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> structured
        interviewers with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from admission until
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> discharge. Suspected cases of delirium were
        identified during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> interview. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with
        changes in their status of consciousness ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>) were consulted by an
        experienced consultation-liaison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SÖ</ENAMEX>).
        Delirium was defined as an organic mental disorder
        involving a confusional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with attention deficit,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disorganized</ENAMEX> thinking and a fluctuating course and acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. The diagnosis of delirium was based on the
        criteria from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of</ENAMEX>
        Mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Disorders</ENAMEX> (revised <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> edition) and established
        through a psychiatric interview (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who had
        history of severe dementia or had abused psychoactive drugs
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> were excluded from our study. Delirium was
        diagnosed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DG</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NDG</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">728</NUMEX>). Analysis of whole blood
        count, arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX>, biochemistry and urine,
        culture antibiograms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, urine or other secretions,
        and radiological examinations, such as chest X-ray, were
        performed on all delirious and non-delirious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. All
        abnormal findings during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">delirium</TIMEX>, related to physical
        conditions, laboratory features, and additional diseases,
        were evaluated as probable risk factors for delirium.
        Findings for risk factors included respiratory disease
        (chronic obstructive pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, cor pulmonale,
        pneumothorax, hemothorax, etc.), symptomatic infection,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fever</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>38°C</ENAMEX>), hypotension (symptomatic, or systolic

        level of serum urea nitrogen (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>100 mg/dl</ENAMEX>), elevated
        level of hepatic enzymes (high alanine aminotransferase,
        high aspartate aminotranferase), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hyperamy-lasemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>300</ENAMEX>

        arrhythmias, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, etc.), emergency admission
        status, age, length of stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> (LSICU), length of
        stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> (LSH), and gender. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were grouped
        according to their diagnosis. The groupings included
        hepatobiliopancreatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (HBP), fistulas, traumas,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute abdominal diseases</ENAMEX>, malignancies, ileus, and others.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had delirium were treated initially for
        etiological <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, but when the treatment was
        insufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX> or haloperidole was
        added.
        Biostatistical evaluation was carried out on an
        IBM-compatible personal computer using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1</NUMEX> software.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test for continuing variables and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test for categoric variables were used. To
        identify factors independently related to the development
        of delirium, we also performed forward stepwise
        (conditional) logistic regression. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
        statistically significant.

        Delirium, a syndrome associated with long hospital stays
        and high rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], is a sign

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delirium</ENAMEX> is seen in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> when the ICU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX> has windows, but rises to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of the cases when
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> has no windows [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. It has been
        determined that preoperative risk factors for delirium were
        older age [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>], prior cognitive impairment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>], pre-existing cerebrovascular or other brain diseases,
        history of prior delirium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], preoperative abnormal
        sodium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], vision or hearing impairment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 26</TIMEX>] and
        regular use of psychotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> before admission [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        In this series, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had delirium; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.4%</NUMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>) of these were older than 60
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years old</TIMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eldest</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91 years old</TIMEX>. All of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, most of whom
        were younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years old</TIMEX>, were kept in an ICU with
        windows. This may be responsible for the low frequency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX> in this series. Although the age of delirious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were higher than that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NDG</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.000</NUMEX>), age was not determined as
        a predicting factor for delirium ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P > 0.05</ENAMEX>, in the logistic
        regression test) in our study. The rate of delirium has a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predominance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 27</TIMEX>]. We found that the number
        of delirious male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was significantly higher than
        female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (χ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>), although gender was not a
        predictive factor for delirium ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P > 0.05</ENAMEX>, in the logistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX>).
        The prevalence of delirium in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Department</ENAMEX>
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.6%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. In this series, the rate of delirium was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.5%</NUMEX> in emergency admissions, similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kishi</ENAMEX>'s series
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], but emergency admission was not considered a
        factor for delirium.
        The etiology of delirium is complex and usually consists
        of multiple factors. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">delirious</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etiology</ENAMEX> is secondary to organic factors, but it is
        difficult to interpret further details [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>].
        Imbalances of electrolytes, metabolic changes, intoxication
        or absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, trauma of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and postoperative state
        are the most common etiological factors. Other less common
        factors are infections, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intracranial lesions</ENAMEX>, coma, fever,
        cardiovasculary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poisons</ENAMEX>, polymedication and
        deficiencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vitamins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 26</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 30</TIMEX>].
        Anti-cholinergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are also commonly accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Surgical stress</ENAMEX> and infectious fever are common factors
        in geriatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] reported that abnormal
        sodium levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>/hypothermia and azotemia were
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predictors</ENAMEX> for delirium in elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Foreman [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] determined that hypernatremia, hypokalemia,
        hyperglycemia, azotemia, hypotension and polymedication
        were predictors for delirium in a prospective study. Some
        predisposing factors determined in our study were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory disease</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.1%</NUMEX>), hypotension (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.4%</NUMEX>), hyponatremia (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.7%</NUMEX>), azotemia (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.8%</NUMEX>), and
        metabolic acidosis (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.6%</NUMEX>). The major neurotransmitter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypothesized</ENAMEX> as involved in delirium is acetylcholine, and
        the major neuro-anatomical area is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reticular</ENAMEX> formation
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Electrolyte imbalance and azotemia may be responsible
        for the decrease in acetylcholine activity in the
        brain.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Symptomatic</ENAMEX> infection and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> were other independent
        predictors of delirium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delirium</ENAMEX> has been reported in
        infectious diseases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diverticulitis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] and typhoid fever [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. Certainly, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> is
        concomitant with many infections and experimental data have
        supported a casual relation between fever and delirium.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fever</ENAMEX> and infection correlated with delirium in our study
        as independent predictors in the multivariate logistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytokines</ENAMEX> and/or bacterial toxins and cerebral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolic</ENAMEX> changes may be causes of the mental changes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with infection.
        To perform specific treatment, it is important to
        determine the etiological factor. Arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX> and
        current and past vital signs should be checked to establish
        whether cerebral hypoxemia or hypertensive encephalopathy
        is present. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with hypoglycemic-induced delirium
        virtually always has a history of insulin-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>. Hypoglycemic delirium is also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperadrenergic</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypotension</ENAMEX> can result from multiple
        etiologies, such as decreased cardiac output from a
        myocardial infarction, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac failure</ENAMEX> or arrhythmias, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>. All medical conditions that cause hypotension can
        lead to a decrease in brain oxygenation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In this
        study, we predicted that respiratory diseases, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, and
        hypotension were effective in delirium by decreasing brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxygenation</ENAMEX>.
        Research into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who developed hepatic failure
        suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-aminobutyric acid</ENAMEX> system is
        important in the development of hepatic encephalopathy
        (i.e. hypoactive delirium caused by liver dysfunction).
        Specifically, endogenous benzodiazepine-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> may
        play a role in delirium associated with hepatic failure [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. In our study, delirium was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.9%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBP</ENAMEX>. The
        abnormalities, such as elevated level of hepatic enzymes,
        hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia and hyperamylasemia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBP</ENAMEX>, were strongly predictive factors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX>. This condition showed that early intervention was
        important in HBP cases.
        The existence of hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed
        clinical subtypes of delirium is widely accepted. The
        hyperactive subtype was more frequent (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46.5%</NUMEX>) than the
        unspecified (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.3%</NUMEX>) and hypoactive subtypes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26.2%</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
        In a series consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, it was observed
        that the hyperactive type (which has a shorter duration) is
        the most commonly seen subtype of delirium, with a rate of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. In our study, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56.7%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">delirious</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        hyperactive subtype.
        There is no specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of treatment is trying to calm
        down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and to identify the underlying cause [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 13</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step is treating the causative factors,
        when determinable. If causative factors are undeterminable,
        then efforts should be directed to preventing permanent
        damage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 3</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butyrophenones</ENAMEX> (haloperidole, thiothixene
        and droperidole), and benzodiazepins (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX>, oksazepam
        and lorazepam) are the recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for sedation and
        preventing agitation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 37, 38</TIMEX>]. In this series, we
        treated the etiological factors in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and gave
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diazepam</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.1%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and haloperidole to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.3%</NUMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Both surgeons and anesthesiologists could reduce the
        incidence of delirium in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are at high risk
        by carefully ordering and monitoring the dosages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>,
        and watching for signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac ischemia</ENAMEX> during the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">perioperative</TIMEX> period [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 10</ENAMEX>].
        The practice of polymedication should not be given up [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 30</ENAMEX>]. The goal in diagnosis is to discover reversible
        causes for delirium. In this study series, we determined
        that conditions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or symptom variables
        (respiratory diseases, symptomatic infections, fever,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anemia</ENAMEX>, hypotension) and laboratory variables
        (hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, azotemia, elevated liver
        enzymes, hyperamylasemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acidosis</ENAMEX>) were predicting factors for delirium. Clinicians
        must identify specific etiologies when possible and apply
        appropriate treatment.
