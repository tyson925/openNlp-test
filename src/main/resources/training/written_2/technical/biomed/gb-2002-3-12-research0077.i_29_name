        Whole-genome analyses have allowed the study of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> both within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and in different species.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computational</ENAMEX> and experimental studies of genomes and gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are providing new perspectives on our
        understanding of the evolution of specificity and cellular
        metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. These efforts remain limited,
        however, by our ability to annotate gene function
        accurately. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, the number of open reading frames
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>) with functions assigned by sequence-similarity-based
        methods is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 43%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. With the inclusion of extensive
        experimental data this value is approaching <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Meanwhile, a search of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein Data Bank</ENAMEX> (PDB) for the
        keyword 'unknown function' retrieved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        Many of these are the result of structural genomics
        initiatives. As this number is likely to grow, it has
        become more important to develop computational tools to
        deduce function from analysis of sequence information in
        the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>.
        Assigning function by sequence homology alone is subject
        to a number of caveats, including the occurrence of
        structurally homologous enzymes that catalyze different
        reactions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and the propagation of error through
        successive rounds of sequence annotation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Conversely,
        assigning function by structure alone can also be daunting,
        even if one ignores the implicit selection bias in
        structure databases relative to sequence databases.
        Analysis of the CATH database revealed that whereas
        function was conserved in nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX> of enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>,
        function had diverged considerably in highly populated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. This has direct implications for
        structure-based function predictions using threading
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Another serious complication in
        structure-based deduction of function is the intrinsic
        limit on our ability to compare distantly related sequences
        and to recognize the role of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue subsets</ENAMEX> in
        multifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It can be difficult to recognize
        whether a distantly related homolog belongs to a
        superfamily with one functional site in common [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] or
        whether that particular structural scaffold accommodates
        multiple functional sites, as with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        It follows that similarity-free function-prediction
        methods are especially desirable. Marcotte 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] used correlated
        evolution, correlated mRNA profiles and patterns of domain
        fusion for genome-wide function prediction. A method based
        on local gene order of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous genes</ENAMEX> has been proposed
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions have been used to
        assign function with surprising success [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and
        functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descriptors</ENAMEX> have been used to search structure
        space [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. However, the individual function-prediction
        capabilities of current methods remain limited, judging by
        the gene annotation content of public databases.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> presumes that the branchpoints separating subclades
        of a phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> can specify molecular speciation
        events, and hence evolutionary selection of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, nodes can mark points in evolution where a protein
        gains, modifies or loses a binding or catalytic function [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>]. The original <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method relies on a partitioning of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX>. This procedure results in sets of nodes at
        different levels of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> (sequence) identity cutoff
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIC</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. However, as phylogenies often contain extreme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> as a result of distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> or rapid
        speciation, pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are not
        represented uniformly across the sequence-identity range.
        This is reflected in a skewed topology of the phylogeny,
        see, for example, the 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
        Streptococcus pyogenes hypothetical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at the bottom of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Hence, the PICs
        correspond to intervals of percent sequence identity, and
        the greater the number and/or magnitude of outliers in the
        family, the larger the percent identity interval (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The presence of these outliers affects multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> and phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> analysis can
        misrepresent the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> at the presumed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIC</ENAMEX>
        level. This issue has been addressed by normalizing the
        score <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the ET</TIMEX> method with sequence variability and
        sequence uniqueness measures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. However, numerical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> reduces the problem to numerical analysis, in
        effect disregarding evolutionary aspects. In the case of
        distant subclades, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> analysis of appropriately chosen
        subclades of the phylogeny will have the desired
        normalization effect. This approach can be used to correct
        for positional variability, sequence representation bias
        and non-uniform phylogenetic topologies.
        Another limitation of the original <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method was the
        definition of invariant and neutral position types.
        Uchtarge 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] recognized that with
        growing sequence databases, the strict definitions of
        invariance as a total lack of variance, and neutrality as a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-residue variation in an aligned position in even one
        family, were destined to require amendment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inherently</ENAMEX>, the
        functional resolution in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method relies on an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimization</ENAMEX> based on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> results from multiple partitions,
        each corresponding to unique definitions of subclade
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invariance</ENAMEX>. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> automated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> methods exist,
        notably a public <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> server by Innis 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and an implementation
        by Aloy 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], optimization of the
        original <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method has evaded automation thus far. The
        result is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> have to resort to manipulation of the
        underlying data and cycles of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> analysis and visual
        inspection of the results mapped to protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        Aside from manually filtering and pruning the data,
        there has been no simple way of controlling which subclades
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are used in the analysis. An elegant
        solution to this problem is to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to access all
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subclades</ENAMEX> represented by the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. In
        this way a number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> variations can be performed,
        extending the analysis to multiple views of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family
        evolutionary data.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> is one possible implementation of protein
        family analysis. Such analyses, which include experimental
        techniques such as alanine scanning [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] and computational
        techniques such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> coloring schemes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], attempt to
        organize the massive amounts of sequence and structure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The results introduce the problem of choice of
        strategies to identify biologically meaningful patterns. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, sequence and structure alignments are frequently
        used to sort features of gene-family data. Analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> provides coherence to the understanding of
        biological data, especially from the perspective of
        distinct features that may explain the unique functional
        attributes of an individual entry. As is common in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX>
        analysis, these features may extend over sequentially or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spatially</ENAMEX> clustered sets of nucleotides or amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, and
        patterns are frequently difficult to identify without a
        form of color coding. Obviously, color coding exploits our
        cognitive pattern-recognition skills - skills that have
        been difficult to replicate algorithmically.
      
      
        Results
        An example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with unknown function is PDB
        1G2R, representing the 
        ylxR gene from 
        Streptococcus pneumoniae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YlxR</ENAMEX> belongs to the putative 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nusA/infB</ENAMEX> operon in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae . The operon contains
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of which are conserved in other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>: 
        rbfA, nusA (with its well
        characterized gene product IF2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infB</ENAMEX> . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        involved in translation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal function</ENAMEX> during
        cold-shock response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YlxR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> has
        been assigned to the 'cluster of orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>' (COG)
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2740</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], which contains the conserved amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> motif
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRGA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y/W</ENAMEX>) (in the single-letter amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> code). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2740</TIMEX> are predicted to be nucleotide-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> implicated in transcription termination. Several
        features of the structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YlxR</ENAMEX>, including the conserved
        and appropriately spaced arginines that could form a
        characteristic positively charged surface patch (colored
        red in Figure 2b,2c) and a large bent groove reminiscent of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding structures, support the argument that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YlxR</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-binding protein</ENAMEX>.
        Structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with small molecules
        have led to and confirmed predictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YlxR</ENAMEX> is complexed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sulfate ions,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which are bound to the arginines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R25 and R45</TIMEX>, and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> to a lysine pair <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K62 and K63</TIMEX>. It has been
        observed that the distances between the sulfate ions
        correspond to distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphate groups</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        duplex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The predicted binding site also fully
        encompasses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the sulfate ions and
        borders the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family retrieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>-BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] consists
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> unique. The hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ancestor sequence</ENAMEX> has three
        conserved arginines. Although this is a relatively small
        family for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> analysis, a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> suggests that only the
        arginine of the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRGA</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y/W</ENAMEX>) motif is absolutely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. However, as the key arginines associated with
        the predicted function are absolutely conserved, this
        implies that the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding function is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> across this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> subclade trace analysis was performed on all
        the subclades of this family ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28% to 53%</NUMEX>
        sequence identity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). After filtering out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        that are inaccessible to the solvent, the following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were identified in the vicinity of the conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginines</ENAMEX> (the conserved arginines are in parentheses):
        K10, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V12</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V13</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S14</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K20</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">r9</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G40</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R25</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G46</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R25</NUMEX>), 48Y
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">R25, R45</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K30 and E31</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R45</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        form a spatial cluster in the vicinity of the conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginines</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues K10</ENAMEX>, the backbone of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S11</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V12</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V12</TIMEX>,
        S14, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V17</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G40</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E55</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K63 and 64V</TIMEX>, from the kinked
        carboxy-terminal helix, a beta-turn, and parts of the
        beta-sheet, define a putative binding epitope (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
        The epitope includes a collection of hydrophobic
        interactions that have been correlated with the evolution
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> forming a surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epitope</ENAMEX> in the vicinity of r9
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
        There appear to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct subclades within the
        YlxR sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, both consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
        unknown or uncertain function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and S 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). A subclade comparison
        was carried out to analyze the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Such a
        comparison is useful when a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family has few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> or limited evolutionary diversity, that is,
        few subclades. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, it appears that independent
        sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are conserved, all in the vicinity of one
        or more of the conserved arginines. These amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        define a slightly larger and differently oriented surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>) than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> subclade trace
        analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>). We propose that the conserved
        residues modulate the specificity of the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        interaction, and that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subclades correspond to
        specificity subtypes within the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, possibly
        with unique functional features. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> not
        identified by subclade trace analysis but appearing in the
        subclade comparison are responsible for a finer level of
        molecular specificity. In this case of a predicted protein
        function, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> analysis presented direct evidence for
        additional binding functions and highlighted the presence
        of potential subtypes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding specificity.
        Another interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of unknown function is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bacterial YbaK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A structure of the homolog from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae has been solved by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. This gene product has
        been proposed to serve as a regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>].
        Analysis of the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the context of the
        structure revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K46</TIMEX>, in a small
        putative binding site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX> fold is related to a
        circular permutation and truncation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lectin</ENAMEX> fold.
        However, a saccharide binding function for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX> is
        unlikely, because of a small putative binding site and lack
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saccharide binding residues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . discuss the possibility of an
        oxyanion hole formed by backbone nitrogens of the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">conserved G101</TIMEX> (with the exception of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginine</ENAMEX> in an unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smegmatis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAD41809</NUMEX>)).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YbaK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is composed of three large subclades,
        related by an absolutely conserved lysine, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K46</TIMEX>. The three
        subclades are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YbaK</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>), an insertion domain in
        the acceptor stem of prokaryotic prolyl-tRNA synthetases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sequences
        were used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> analysis. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> formed a
        distinct subclade containing the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae YbaK sequence.

        the conservation of the progenitor sequences of a single
        selected node (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>), identified a number of neutral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polar</ENAMEX> and hydrophobic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids conserved</ENAMEX> in the YbaK
        subclade on the conserved lysine face of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3a</TIMEX>,
        top). This was consistent with the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Among these conserved
        positions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> identified a cluster of
        solvent-accessible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> above and beyond the proposed
        oxyanion hole, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y20</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H22</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D23</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E32 and R132</TIMEX>.
        Together, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues form</ENAMEX> a polar surface patch and the
        wall of the putative binding site. D23 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E32</ENAMEX> contribute
        to the negative face identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> .
        The phylogenetic partition JEvTrace algorithm was
        carried out using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> partitions from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> average
        percent sequence identity range (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>). The resulting
        highest-scoring position is S104 (magenta), and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T47</TIMEX>,
        T96, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y98</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G102</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">I103 and S129</TIMEX> (orange). Most of these
        positions are partially shielded from solvent and/or
        contribute main-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions.
        Eliminating solvent-accessible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> left <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S129</TIMEX>, a
        position that belongs to the neutral polar patch of the
        putative binding site. Considering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> with less
        prominent scores (gray, blue, cyan, yellow), the size of
        the epitope identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> increases considerably
        and encompasses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K46</TIMEX> face (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3b</TIMEX>,
        top). Together these positions form a partially buried
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> that defines the bottom and walls of the putative
        ligand-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> spanning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K46</TIMEX> face. From the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
        level on (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) all identified positions are on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lysine</ENAMEX> face of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX>. Significantly, the loop
        immediately above the oxyanion hole is disordered in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX> PDB <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">1DBX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. This loop, formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26-30</NUMEX>, is not conserved nor does it conserve chemical
        properties across the phylogeny. However, a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subclades</ENAMEX> express invariance at these positions. Because of
        its proximity to the conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G101</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> branch of the
        J-shaped putative binding site, this disordered region is
        predicted to contribute to the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificity of YbaK</ENAMEX>. A number of structural studies by NMR
        have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX> are flexible and
        undergo conformational changes upon binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>].
        Using GRASP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] predicted a positively
        charged patch on the face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein opposite K46</ENAMEX>, and
        a negatively charged patch on a face adjacent to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K46</TIMEX>.
        However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">YbaK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> has the interesting feature of
        a single conserved lysine separated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> or neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> from a circular arrangement
        of mixed charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asp, Arg, Glu, Lys</ENAMEX>). These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues</ENAMEX> line the perimeter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the K46</TIMEX> face. This is
        reminiscent of numerous examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        interaction, where hydrophobic "rings" of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are
        observed to surround polar and charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, with the
        proposed purpose of screening ionic interactions from
        solvent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. This potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        interaction feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX> is additionally supported by
        evidence that the prolyl-tRNA synthetases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>) interact with other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>. There may be
        additional surface patches of mixed positively and
        negatively charged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">YbaK</ENAMEX>. However, the
        positively charged surface identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . contains the largest number
        of high scoring positions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple phylogenetic partitions</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3b</NUMEX>). The lysine
        perimeter patch (Figure 3a,3b, top) and other potential
        patches are not conserved nor are they identified
        completely by the partition algorithm (Figure 3a,3b, side),
        and thus are not expected to be a predominant functional
        feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YbaK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> analysis suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX> is involved in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction requiring a binding site with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> and polar patches, and an oxyanion hole
        opposite a conserved lysine. Pursuing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        interaction hypothesis, it appears that a protruding
        J-shaped polypeptide volume involving an aspartic or
        glutamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, or a negatively charged cofactor, is a
        likely ligand for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">YbaK</ENAMEX>-binding site. The face opposite
        this binding site presents a patch of positively charged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, supporting the hypothesis of a nucleotide binding
        function for at least some subclades of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YbaK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
        Thus although, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YbaK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> subtypes only share one
        conserved amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, the patterns of
        subclade sequence conservation suggest a main binding
        function, characterized by unique specificity within
        multiple clades that is spatially centered around the
        conserved lysine, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K46</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        
          JEvTrace
          The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method has been a successful tool for analyzing
          protein functional surfaces using the additional
          information present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phylogenetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
          However, this approach has been limited by difficulty in
          producing a dynamic graphical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX> to analyze
          the data. The optimization involved in producing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX>
          results has previously relied on manually manipulating
          the underlying data, while certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> of analysis were
          inherently inaccessible. Thus, identification of the
          dominant spatial cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">invariant residues</ENAMEX> has been
          unwieldy. To improve this operational challenge we have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructed JEvTrace</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of algorithms and
          objects together with a graphical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user interface</ENAMEX>. The
          algorithms allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to identify evolutionarily
          relevant positions based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> selections of subclades
          (Figure 2a,2b) or partitions of the phylogeny (Figure
          3b). This approach introduces new features and parameters
          in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> analysis. Additional algorithms for tracing
          subclade conservation through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of a
          specific subclade (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>) and subclade conservation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> (Figure 2a,2c) are also implemented. The user
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> produces interactive graphical results, and
          access to the corresponding sequence, phylogenetic and
          protein structure data. To map <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> results and alignment
          selections to the structural dimension, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamically</ENAMEX> linked to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3D</NUMEX>-structure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>, WebMol
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
          These algorithms (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods) allow
          comparisons of features within a phylogeny in ways that
          are not directly limited by the topology of the
          phylogeny, sequence representation bias or sequence
          distance metrics. The implementation allows an analysis
          of any possible combination of subclades within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phylogeny</ENAMEX>. The resulting decompositions of
          evolutionary sequence data allow multiple definitions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, structure and function homology within a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and hence grant new perspectives to
          family sequence analysis.
          The original <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method relies on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> phylogenetic results in order to identify
          predicted functional sites. A recognized limitation of
          the original method was filtering out buried polar side
          chains within structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clefts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> gives
          access to the entire set of results before residue
          solvent-accessibility filtering. Extensive structural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filtering</ENAMEX>, not limited to solvent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">accessibility</ENAMEX> can be
          carried out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WebMol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> facilitates the analysis of other features of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protein families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conserved</ENAMEX> positions can be found for
          any subclade in the phylogeny, and the conservation and
          variability between any set of subclades can be analyzed
          (subclade comparison, Figure 2b,2c). This functionality
          can be used to distinguish homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
          different functions, as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> suggested by Aloy 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. For a particular
          subclade, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> can perform a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> trace,
          identifying the subclade specific conservation within a
          chain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> subclades of a node (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3a</NUMEX>).
          This method can be used as an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> surrogate if there is
          lack of significant homology between subclades of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. This was helpful in the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YbaK</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> can identify the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in a single
          sequence relative to the considered sequence data. This
          was useful for our drug-design efforts on a malarial
          cysteine protease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> also serves as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>. Any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> analysis of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> or phylogenetic data can be visualized on
          available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. This can be useful in
          protein structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> modeling by highlighting the
          evolutionary contexts for structural analysis within a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. All these informatics features
          address sequence determinants of specificity and
          similarity using distinct biological data.
          In general, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> approach is more difficult to apply
          at lower percent sequence identity, owing to the problem
          of building accurate sequence alignments, especially in
          the absence of structural information [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>]. For
          example, annotations based on remote homology pairwise
          alignments were a significant source of errors in the
          initial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genome annotation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Known alignment
          problems occur at the amino and carboxyl termini of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and even more commonly in loop regions. In
          addition to an accurate alignment, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> also requires a
          minimal amount of sequence information and the related
          parameter of evolutionary diversity within the protein
          family. Of the algorithms provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX>, the
          parent/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> trace and subclade comparisons can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as few as two</NUMEX> sequences. The partition trace
          and subclade trace require more than a pair of subclades,
          and benefit non-linearly from larger amounts of data.
          Overall, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> largest effects of limited sequence data
          are the signal-to-noise ratio for the correlation of
          invariant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and the ability to
          identify functional specificity and specific functions.
          As a corollary, until the sequence space of a protein
          family has been sampled sufficiently, insight into the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> functions and specificities within a phylogeny
          remain limited.
        
        
          SCF: an MSA sequence coloring format
          With rapidly enlarging biological data sources, there
          is a clear need for sensible standards. We propose SCF: a
          file format that will encode any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined coloring
          scheme for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and nucleotide sequences as well as
          their secondary and tertiary structures, based on the
          inherent structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAs</ENAMEX>. The format is simple, easy to
          verify manually, and readable as text by any alignment or
          structure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX>.
          An example <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> alignment with a selection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residues</ENAMEX>, including absolutely conserved positions as
          well as positions forming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> structural epitopes in one
          of the known protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. It
          is important to note that only selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> are
          encoded - which is both a performance and a storage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX>. Our implementation of an alignment viewer allows
          transparent interaction with tertiary structures, using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JAVA applet WebMol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. In this setting, the color
          format serves to annotate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with
          multiple sequence information, and allows comparisons
          across multiple sequences and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. This format
          should also aid the visualization of experimental results
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to biological sequences and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. Most
          important, it will allow integration of visualized
          sequence alignment results under a single representation
          scheme.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have designed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> application, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX>,
        implementing the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] and its variations. These
        methods have in common the analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> families
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAs</ENAMEX>, phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method has proved a useful tool for understanding
        the sequential and structural aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function,
        including the analysis of variations relevant to molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. From an evolutionary perspective, the function
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family encompasses both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, for example, substrate specificity reflected in
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids lining substrate</ENAMEX>-binding pockets, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>, for example, regions responsible for general
        enzymatic activity or binding of a common molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffold</ENAMEX>. While it is trivial to identify absolutely
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, function discovery often requires a
        context for the predicted or unknown function associated
        with the absolute conservation pattern.
        Using the examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YlxR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">YbaK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> identified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues clustering</ENAMEX> around the putative conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">functional residue</ENAMEX>(s), thus validating a functional
        prediction. These findings supported an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding
        prediction for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YlxR</ENAMEX> and most likely a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">interaction interface for YbaK</ENAMEX>. For discovery of additional
        functional properties, as in the case of a new binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">YlxR</ENAMEX> or the extensive putative binding site and
        positively charged epitope in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">YbaK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> provided
        phylogenetic evidence of clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> on the
        protein surface.
        It is hoped that the JEvTrace implementation will lead
        to analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> at varying levels of
        detail, leading to useful decompositions of the data. One
        of these decompositions comes from evidence in the
        evolutionary record of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. As documented by
        the biological applications of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method, evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> presents evidence allowing the distinction of
        conserved spatial arrangements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> versus
        evolutionary sequence changes with negligible or no effect
        on function. Together with experimental data, the
        decompositions of evolutionary data provided by JEvTrace
        may enable us to make additional distinctions in the
        molecular specificity, kinetic and dynamic properties of
        protein function.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence</ENAMEX> family retrieval and analysis
          We chose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structures of unknown function,
          and retrieved their protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from the sequence
          database. The sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was used as a
          query for PSI-BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenPept</ENAMEX> database
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>). The sequences were then aligned and phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> created with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and/or combinations of
          software from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCG</ENAMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PILEUP</ENAMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42, 43</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUPSEARCH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Algorithm
          The binary phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> data are
          implemented as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. The phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>,
          assumed to be binary, is modeled as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> and nodes
          along with an ordering such that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> shares a
          node with a parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> child
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX>. Each node in the phylogeny corresponds to a
          subset of sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX>. Every phylogenetic branch
          is represented with an abstract consensus sequence, used
          to model the corresponding subclade sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>. The implemented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> derives a
          consensus sequence for every subclade of sequences
          represented in the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. This information is
          used to dynamically generate results with the supplied
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithms</ENAMEX> based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined subclades or partitions
          of subclades.
          The partition trace variation of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method assigns
          nodes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> to a defined partition of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX>. Partitions are perpendicular to the direction
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Sequence conservation
          in each subclade is compared pairwise to conservation in
          all other subclades within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given partition</TIMEX>.
          Alternatively, in the subclade trace algorithm, requiring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user specification</ENAMEX> of a set of nodes, the defined nodes
          are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algorithmically</ENAMEX> treated as a single partition. The
          subclade trace does not require partitions, and is
          therefore independent of the topology of the phylogeny.
          In both algorithms, each position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> is scored by
          the frequency of conservation of different amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in
          pairs of subclades at that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> position. In the partition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace</ENAMEX>, the score is cumulative across partitions. All
          scores are normalized if there are more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> pairs
          of invariant subclades at any alignment position. The
          numerical scores are mapped to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-color scale
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), limited by graphical interaction with the
          structure. Scores can include normalization by the
          sequence variability of the identified invariant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subclades</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> also provides the ability to perform a single
          subclade trace. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined subclade is assigned as
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> node, and the subclade-specific
          sequence conservation below or above that node is
          identified. Subclade-specific conservation is defined by
          the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are conserved in a subclade but
          not in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>. The results are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of related
          subclades of the phylogeny, with color-coded subclade
          sequence selections on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> and structure. We call
          this variation of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trace</ENAMEX>, and it is especially useful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subclades</ENAMEX> and cases of highly speciated specificity.
          JEvTrace generates results dynamically, displays them
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> and enables saving in standard graphics
          formats or the SCF format. As in the original <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method,
          absolutely conserved positions are inherently excluded
          from the analysis. Structural filtering is assigned to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WebMol JAVA</ENAMEX> program, packaged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX>.
          Concurrently with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WebMol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> reads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> data and
          aligns the sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> with a selected
          sequence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX>. This alignment enables <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> to
          map results and selections from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> to the structural
          dimension. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> also presents the option of using the
          ACCESS program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>], which calculates the static solvent
          accessibility of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>]. This
          solvent-accessibility data can be used to filter results
          of the phylogenetic analysis by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid solvent accessibility</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>].
        
        
          JEvTrace implementation
          The program takes as input an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX>, or an MSA with a
          corresponding phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PILEUP</ENAMEX> (GCG),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] formats are
          recognized. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylogeny</ENAMEX> is interpreted as a binary tree
          with a hypothetical root. Protein structure viewing is
          designated to the JAVA structure viewer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WebMol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Alignment</ENAMEX> selections in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> can be mapped to the
          Chimera structure viewer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>] using an earlier version
          of the SCF format available in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX>. As many proteins
          lack representative crystal structures, use of structures
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> analysis is optional. Currently, JEvTrace
          supports <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WebMol</ENAMEX> window per session.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> can select up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> partitions of the
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, or choose any set of nodes. A number
          of operations, including the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> method, can be carried
          out on the selected parts of the phylogeny. The resulting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are independent of structural information and can be
          viewed and manipulated directly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> of the protein
          family. To aid interpretation of the phylogenetic data,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> can be annotated with the percent sequence
          identity of all the subclades. The identified positions
          are visualized on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> as well as any available
          structures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Among the many sequence-structure features of JEvTrace
          is the ability to highlight the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in contact with
          a selected position, using a residue-residue distance
          calculation and a distance cutoff. A number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sequence</ENAMEX>-based features are also available, including
          calculation of alignment position statistics for a
          variety of physical-chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>: molecular volume
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>], average pKa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>-bonding potential,
          number of rotatable bonds and hydrophobicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> graphical canvases: a
          binary phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, a list of sequence identifiers
          (for example, accession codes) and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX>. The three
          canvases are aligned by row, such that the terminal nodes
          (representing individual sequences) of the phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree align</ENAMEX> with their names and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and alignment canvases are scrollable in two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>, and have a practical capacity of more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 400</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, on a Pentium
          workstation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">256 M of RAM</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> functions are
          organized into menus and buttons, allowing extensive user
          interaction with the data. Any results that are
          represented graphically in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WebMol</ENAMEX> can be
          printed or saved.
        
        
          Sequence coloring format (SCF)
          implementation
          The colored format for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> is given as a text file
          with the file extension '.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX>'. It is accurate with
          respect to the underlying sequence data, given that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>(s) remains unchanged in length and order. As a
          safeguard for underlying sequence data consistency, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> object calculates a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> checksum variable (see SCF
          website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>] for details). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relational</ENAMEX> databases and
          software environments such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> represent dynamic
          extensions of the format. The coloring data can exist as
          an individual file or can be appended to the actual data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">file - Multiple Sequence Format</ENAMEX> (MSF) (GCG) or CLUSTALW [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>] files in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX>, and a PDB file [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>] for
          structural data. Appending the coloring to the underlying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> can allow transparent annotation by color.
          The residue positions of sequences in an alignment are
          uniquely indexed from top to bottom, using sequence
          numbers starting at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> as rows, and left to right, using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> positions starting at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> as columns. The
          actual file format consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> columns: sequence
          number, residue number, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> columns for the primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> space (red green blue, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RGB</ENAMEX>) designation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>, and an optional comment/property column (Figure
          1c). The last column can accommodate accepted coloring
          schemes or can be used to define properties for colors
          and/or the underlying data. This format accommodates any
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24-bit</NUMEX> digital color, and allows highlighting of any
          subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in any subset of sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX>.
          The selections are encoded in a hierarchical sorted
          manner, that is, smallest to largest sequence position,
          and within this group smallest to largest sequence, and
          within those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, smallest to largest color
          values.
          Our JEvTrace implementation of the SCF format in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX>,
          allows reading of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> data files, and
          interpretation of the SCF coloring data in each of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contexts</ENAMEX>. In addition, the underlying sequence data are
          modeled as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> objects, whose properties are dynamically
          updated. In this implementation, it is possible to
          translate selections between different MSAs that share at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sequence. Using a single sequence as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'translator'</ENAMEX>, any selections can be 'translated' from one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> to another, given that both alignments contain
          the 'translator' sequence. This feature is useful in
          bridging analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> containing distant
          homologs, performing independent analysis of multiple
          subclades of a protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, or updating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSA</ENAMEX> data.
        
        
          Hardware
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JEvTrace</ENAMEX> and SCF JAVA packages have been tested on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGI MIPS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pentium Pro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windows</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linux</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> packages are compatible with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> and
          higher versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Availability
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAVA</ENAMEX> executable package and manual for JEvTrace v1.0
          is available on the web [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. A description and JAVA
          source for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v1.0</ENAMEX> format are also available on the
