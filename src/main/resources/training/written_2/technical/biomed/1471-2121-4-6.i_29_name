        Subcellular localization of mRNAs represents a
        fundamental mechanism for post-transcriptional control of
        cell and tissue function. Examples include the polarized
        localization of oocyte mRNAs which is crucial for the
        establishment <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">axis</ENAMEX> formation in the embryo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] , the
        targeting of specific mRNAs to the synapses of nerve cells
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , centrosomal segregation of mRNAs in the mollusk
        embryo which results in asymmetric inheritance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and
        the localization of Î²-actin mRNA to sites of active actin
        polymerization at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In each of these cases, mRNA targeting is mediated
        by the cytoskeleton. For example, growth factor-induced
        localization of actin mRNA to the leading edge of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> is a dynamic, regulated process requiring
        actomyosin interactions and activation of the RhoGTPase
        pathway, as well as specific signal sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' UTR
        of the message [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11 12</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, disruption of the
        actin cytoskeleton using pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> also blocks
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of Î²-actin mRNA with microfilaments and
        prevents localization of the transcript to the cell
        periphery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 13</ENAMEX> ] . Mechanical forces exerted on cell
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">integrin receptors</ENAMEX>, which anchor the actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> to the extracellular matrix, also produce
        changes in the localization of poly(A) mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> inside the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the
        localization of transcripts can serve as a key regulatory
        step in gene expression as inhibition of mRNA targeting can
        significantly impact cell function. For example, replacing
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of the mRNA for the intermediate filament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, vimentin, with the Î²-actin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'UTR sequence results
        in mislocalization of vimentin transcript, altered
        fibroblast morphology, and impaired motility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        To date, only a relatively small number of gene
        transcripts are known to target to the cytoskeleton and all
        of these have been found empirically. 
        In situ hybridization technologies
        and microinjection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> have
        greatly enhanced our ability to observe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular RNA</ENAMEX>
        localization with high spatial resolution. However, the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA species</ENAMEX> that may be simultaneously observed
        using these approaches is usually limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>
        transcript at a time. We hypothesized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        mRNAs with the cytoskeleton may be a more widespread
        post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that extends to a
        larger subset of transcripts than is currently recognized.
        To explore this possibility, we used gene microarray
        technology to identify and analyze large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosolic</ENAMEX> and cytoskeleton-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> isolated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> promyelocytic cells. By combining traditional
        biochemical subcellular fractionation methods with
        massively-parallel gene profiling technology, we were able
        to ask the question: how many different eukaryotic mRNAs
        interact with the cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and what is their
        identity?
      
      
        Results
        To investigate whether multiple mRNAs associate with the
        cytoskeleton, exponentially growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> promyelocytic
        cells were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biochemically</ENAMEX> extracted to obtain fractions
        enriched for either cytoskeleton or cytosolic components.
        Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed in nonionic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> to release the soluble, cytosolic fraction. Upon
        centrifugation, the pellet, containing cellular matrix, was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in high salt buffer to release
        cytoskeleton-associated components. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from
        both fractions and hybridized to nylon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filter DNA</ENAMEX> arrays
        that contained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5184</TIMEX> gene or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences. After filtering
        out genes whose signal intensity was not significantly
        above background noise, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">649</NUMEX> known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> remained. Analysis
        of these genes revealed a subset of transcripts that were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">enriched 2-15</ENAMEX> fold in the cytoskeleton fraction relative to
        the cytosolic fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, top). Selected transcripts
        identified by microarray analysis, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-actin</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrin</ENAMEX> and phosphatidylinositol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-kinase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PI4K</NUMEX>), were
        subsequently confirmed by semi-quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Among the subset of transcripts that were found to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the cytoskeleton fraction were several mRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, such as those encoding Î²-actin mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunits</ENAMEX>, that have previously been shown to be
        cytoskeleton-associated in other cell types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 16</NUMEX> ] . In
        addition, we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 20</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        cytoskeleton-associated transcriptome, the majority of
        which encode structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to interact directly
        with cytoskeleton filaments, such as spectrin and protein
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spectrin is an integral</ENAMEX> component of the
        submembranous cytoskeleton that is required for maintenance
        of cell shape and mechanical stability of the surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. Interactions between spectrin and actin filaments
        are stabilized by protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> and regulated by a variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">accessory proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protein 4.1</ENAMEX> also may connect
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> translation apparatus to the cytoskeleton
        through interactions with a component of the eukaryotic
        translation initiation factor-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eIF3-p44</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, mRNAs for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in
        translation, such as various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>, were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the cytoskeleton fraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> found to be cytoskeleton-associated in this
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">encode</ENAMEX> PI4K which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the cytoskeleton
        backbone of the focal adhesion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] as well as thymosin
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²4</NUMEX>, an actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer sequestering protein</ENAMEX> that also
        contributes to control of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell motility</ENAMEX> and contractility [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] .
        To determine which specific class of cytoskeleton
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filaments</ENAMEX> is required for the localization of these mRNAs,
        cells were treated with latrunculin B (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">min. Latrunculin</ENAMEX> B depolymerizes actin microfilaments and
        hence should release components that normally associate
        with the actin cytoskeleton. Western blotting of the
        biochemical fractions prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation confirmed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">latrunculin</ENAMEX> B treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in
        the amount of Î²-actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that was extracted in the
        cytoskeleton fraction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from these
        samples revealed a shift of the cytoskeleton-associated
        transcripts to the cytosolic fraction upon exposure to
        latrunculin, indicating that these transcripts had been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In contrast, depolymerizing microtubules with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocodazole</ENAMEX> did not change the distribution of these
        transcripts between the cytosolic and cytoskeleton
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> promyelocytic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> cells have been widely used
        as a model system for the study of hematopoietic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> because they undergo terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> to one of several cell types of the
        myelo-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">monocytic</ENAMEX> lineage when stimulated with various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacological</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . In particular, induction of
        macrophage differentiation by treatment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HL60</NUMEX> cells with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPA</ENAMEX> is accompanied by dramatic alterations in cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> and cytoskeleton structure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precursor HL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
        cells are spherical and grow in suspension, whereas the
        differentiated macrophage-like cells become adherent and
        spread. To examine whether differentiation and
        reorganization of the cytoskeleton produces changes in mRNA
        distribution, macrophage differentiation was induced by the
        addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPA</ENAMEX> to suspension cultures of
        exponentially proliferating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> promyelocytic cells.
        Within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 hrs</NUMEX> of induction, the previously non-adherent
        cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) attached and spread on the tissue culture
        plastic (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The serial extraction approach described
        above was used to separate cytosolic and cytoskeleton mRNA
        fractions from these adherent cells. Spatial distribution
        profiles of mRNAs in differentiated HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells were
        obtained using microarrays and compared with profiles of
        the spherical precursor HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells.
        Rather than comparing the entire transcriptome of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">undifferentiated</ENAMEX> versus differentiated cells as is commonly
        done [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , we were interested in how the two
        transcriptome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compartments</ENAMEX> behaved upon differentiation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX>. We found that the terminally differentiated cells
        contained a greater number of cytoskeleton-associated
        transcripts than suspended precursor cells, consistent with
        the idea that the cytoskeleton plays a larger role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizing RNAs</ENAMEX> in adherent cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1bottom</ENAMEX> versus
        top, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> unique mRNAs exhibited
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or more enrichment in the cytoskeleton-associated
        samples. A scatterplot of the ratios of cytoskeleton to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosolic RNAs</ENAMEX> in the precursor and macrophage cells
        revealed a shift in the distribution of individual
        transcripts to the cytoskeletal compartment upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> did not change their localization status as
        indicated by the fact that the ratios of most genes
        remained close to the diagonal in this plot.
        To further characterize changes in the overall
        distribution pattern of mRNAs upon differentiation, we
        performed hierarchical cluster analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA profiles</ENAMEX> representing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spatial pools
        (cytosolic and cytoskeleton) in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types
        (undifferentiated and differentiated cells). Complete
        linkage clustering based on Euclidean distance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] of
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sets of transcripts (cytosolic versus
        cytoskeleton transcripts in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells in the presence or
        absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPA</ENAMEX>) revealed that the cytoskeleton-anchored
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the precursor HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells and those in the
        macrophage cells were most similar (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In other
        words, mRNAs within each distinct subcellular compartment
        clustered more closely together than those of the same cell
        type. Thus, the overall subcellular distribution of mRNAs
        is largely conserved across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different cell types
        despite significant changes in cytoskeleton architecture,
        adhesive state and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell morphology</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        Interactions between mRNA and cytoskeleton filaments are
        responsible for the spatial distribution and localized
        function of several transcripts in somatic cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 24</NUMEX>
        ] . However, since only a small number of localized mRNAs
        have previously been uncovered, it is not known to what
        extent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> with the cytoskeleton might
        be a more general mechanism of gene regulation. Our data
        suggest that while many mRNAs distribute equally between
        the cytosolic and cytoskeletal fractions, a specific set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> preferentially with actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfilaments</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, this spatial distribution pattern was
        retained even after the round HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells were chemically
        induced to differentiate into macrophages that adhere and
        spread on the culture substrate, a process that involves
        extensive alterations in cytoskeletal architecture and
        genome-wide changes in gene expression. Thus, the
        cytoskeleton-associated transcripts may encode a core group
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose expression may be regulated at the
        post-transcriptional level through their association with
        the components of the actin cytoskeleton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
        Consistent with this hypothesis, the majority of
        cytoskeleton-associated transcripts identified in this
        study encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that modulate cytoskeleton structure
        or adhesion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrin</ENAMEX> and protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> form a complex with
        actin filaments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 26</NUMEX> ] that may be important in
        signaling in additional to forming a physical link between
        the cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PI4K</TIMEX> activity has been shown to associate with
        the actin cytoskeleton by biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> extraction
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] and is thought to specifically localize with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±3Î²1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . PI4K catalyzes the production of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate</ENAMEX>, an intermediate in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways</ENAMEX> which
        itself can interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">actin binding proteins</ENAMEX> to regulate
        microfilament polymerization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Our work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> suggests
        that the mRNAs of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are all positioned in
        close association with the actin cytoskeleton to permit
        efficient localization of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX>.
        Given the limited sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA arrays</ENAMEX>, it is
        possible that the cytoskeleton may play a role in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> and regulation of additional cellular
        transcripts that could not be detected with the approach
        described here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Abundant mRNA species</ENAMEX> may target only a
        miniscule fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mRNA</ENAMEX> molecules to the cytoskeleton;
        this may be the functionally important fraction but its
        relevance would not be revealed using this method. On the
        other hand, mRNAs of lowly expressed genes may be entirely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the cytoskeleton but may fall below the
        limits of microarray detection. For the majority of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, the relationship between mRNA localization and
        translational activation remains unclear. It is therefore
        possible that although only a small fraction of a
        particular transcript <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the cytoskeleton,
        these localized molecules might actually represent the
        actively translated subpopulation.
        This naturally raises the question of whether the
        cytoskeleton-associated transcripts are differentially
        expressed in promyelocyte and macrophage cells. Tamayo 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> have previously monitored gene
        expression at various time points following phorbol
        ester-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> in the same HL-60 cell system
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Thirteen of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> transcripts we identified as
        cytoskeleton-associated were also assayed in that study by
        Tamayo, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> of these
        transcripts-alpha spectrin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pim-1</ENAMEX> were found to vary
        significantly, in that the expression of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in the promyelocytic cell type and increased
        dramatically upon differentiation to the macrophage cell
        type. Future work in this area might address the potential
        relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytoskeleton-localization</ENAMEX> and
        expression of these transcripts.
        As a mechanosensitive scaffold that controls a large set
        of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the actin cytoskeleton is
        critically poised to modulate a variety of cellular
        processes, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, cell survival,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> and proliferation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 31 32</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> function of
        the cytoskeleton in gene regulation appears to be the
        spatial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of transcripts and possibly their
        translation within the intracellular environment. Our work
        demonstrates that a subset of gene transcripts interacts
        with the actin cytoskeleton and that this subpopulation
        includes a number of structural and cytoskeleton-modulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as well as molecules involved in protein
        translation. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis
        that cellular evolution resulted from self-assembly of
        molecular scaffolds, like the actin cytoskeleton, that
        provide simultaneous structural and biochemical functions,
        including orienting mRNA transcripts and facilitating their
        translation into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that self-assemble into the very
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scaffolds</ENAMEX> to which they associate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        In summary, this work extends our view of
        post-transcriptional control of gene expression by
        revealing that multiple transcripts involved in cellular
        regulation associate with the actin cytoskeleton. The
        subcellular localization of the majority of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> had not been previously investigated. It
        appears that information about the spatial context of an
        mRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, in addition to knowledge of its temporal
        expression pattern, may be necessary for a more complete
        view of gene regulation. Thus, a combination of other
        biochemical fractionation techniques (e.g., isolation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microtubule</ENAMEX> or intermediate filament cytoskeleton
        compartments, nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">matrix</ENAMEX>, etc.) with massively parallel
        gene profiling technology may provide additional insights
        into cellular regulation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this work, we set out to explore the extent to which
        somatic cell transcripts associate with the cytoskeleton
        and to identify the specific transcripts that might be
        regulated through cytoskeleton localization. A set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX>, encoding structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, cytoskeletal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and components of the translation machinery, was
        shown to be highly enriched in the cytoskeleton-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells. Intact actin microfilaments were
        required for the localization and/or anchoring of these
        transcripts. In addition, this study emphasizes the value
        of using subcellular fractionation to expand the range of
        genome-wide technologies by providing information about the
        spatial distribution of a transcript, in addition to its
        expression level.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell culture conditions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Suspended HL-60</ENAMEX> promyelocytic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMDM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clonetics</ENAMEX>) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal
          bovine serum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyclone</ENAMEX>). Cells were seeded in tissue
          culture flasks at a density of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Ã— 10 5cells/ml</ENAMEX> and
          expanded when the culture reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Ã— 10 6cells/ml.</ENAMEX> To
          induce macrophage differentiation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM phorbol ester
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPA</ENAMEX>) was added to growth cultures at a cell density of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.5 Ã— 10 6cells/ml</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> hrs prior to harvest. To
          depolymerize actin microfilaments, cells were treated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml latrunculin B (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytoskeleton, Inc.</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>
          prior to harvest.
        
        
          Cell harvest and serial extraction
          Subcellular fractionation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> into
          cytoskeleton-associated and cytosolic fractions was
          performed as previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 34</NUMEX> ] . In brief,
          HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells were harvested by centrifugation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspension</ENAMEX> in buffer A (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> Igepal nonionic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>). The minimal concentration of nonionic
          detergent required to release cytosolic components
          without disrupting nuclei was determined by measuring
          lactate dehydrogenase activity as a marker for release of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosol</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> concentration that released
          <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the lactate dehydrogenase activity in the
          cytosolic fraction was chosen for all subsequent studies.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TPA-</ENAMEX>treated cells become adherent and were harvested at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> hr by scraping in buffer A, pelleting the cells, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspending</ENAMEX> in buffer A plus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igepal</ENAMEX>. After
          incubating for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, the samples were pelleted
          by centrifugation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) and the supernatant containing
          "cytosolic" components was collected. The pellet was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in high salt buffer B (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0.25 M</ENAMEX> sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> to
          disrupt the cytoskeleton and release associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclei</ENAMEX> and internal membranes were removed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) and the supernatant containing
          "cytoskeleton-associated" components was collected. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          was isolated from the cytosolic and
          cytoskeleton-associated fractions using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNeasy</ENAMEX> miniprep
          column and reagents (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>). As an internal control for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation procedure, an exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that was
          generated by 
          in vitro transcription from a
          pBluScriptII plasmid was added to the fractions prior to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the
          exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pBluII RNA</ENAMEX> was equally distributed between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytosolic</ENAMEX> and cytoskeleton-associated fractions.
        
        
          Microarray hybridization and analysis
          Small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼g</ENAMEX>) from each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA fraction</ENAMEX> were
          reverse transcribed and radiolabeled (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼g oligo dT, 1x
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Strand</ENAMEX> buffer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U SuperscriptII</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM dNTP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dATP</ENAMEX>, dGTP, dTTP
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 mCi 33P-dCTP</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN Radiochemicals</ENAMEX>). Probes were
          purified by passage through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Spin6</ENAMEX> chromatography
          column (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX> gene filter (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GF201</NUMEX>)
          was prehybridized in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MicroHyb</ENAMEX> solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics</ENAMEX>) containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Î¼g Cot-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> poly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dA</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2.5</NUMEX> hr. The probe
          was denatured by heating to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">95Â°C</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min</TIMEX> before adding
          to the prehybridization solution. Hybridization was
          carried out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">42Â°C</NUMEX> in a hybridization roller
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oven</ENAMEX>. Membranes were washed twice in 2x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> at
          50Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> and once in 0.5x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55Â°C</TIMEX> for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min. After washing, the filter was placed on moist
          filter paper, sealed in plastic wrap and exposed to a
          phosphor imaging screen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-2 days</TIMEX>. Images were
          acquired using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneStorm</ENAMEX> phosphor imaging system
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>). Filters were stripped by placing in
          boiling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> with shaking for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr. Each sample probe
          was sequentially hybridized to the same human gene filter
          to control for variation between filters. The Pathways
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX>) software package was used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> and initial comparisons. Additional
          analysis was performed using <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Matlab 5.3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mathworks</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustan</ENAMEX> 4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustan Graphics</ENAMEX>). Comparison of multiple
          scans of the same sample revealed that low intensity
          spots (intensity <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1</NUMEX>) were variable due to background
          noise; these were not included in subsequent
          analysis.
        
        
          Western blotting
          HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cells were harvested and serial extractions were
          performed as described above. Equal volumes of each
          sample (cytosolic and cytoskeleton-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>)
          were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE, transferred to a
          nitrocellulose membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>) and immunoblotted with
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-actin</NUMEX> and detected using
          horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Laboratories</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SuperSignal West Dura</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>)
          as a chemiluminescent substrate.
        
        
          RT-PCR
          Semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was
          used to confirm the relative abundance of specific mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the cytosolic and cytoskeleton-associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. In addition, the abundance of histone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>, a
          transcript that distributed equally between the cytosolic
          and cytoskeleton fractions in microarray analysis, was
          confirmed. cDNA was synthesized from each sample by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">incubating 1</ENAMEX> ug <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 mM</NUMEX> each dNTP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Î¼g</ENAMEX>/ml random hexamer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boehringer Mannheim</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> RNase
          inhibitor, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U OmniScript</ENAMEX> reverse transcriptase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OmniScript RT Buffer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> microliters of

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) was used for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction in
          a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 Î¼l</NUMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pmol of each
          primer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> mM each dNTP and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U Taq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen PCR</ENAMEX> buffer. PCR cycling conditions were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at
          94Â°C and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 26 or 30</TIMEX> cycles of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 sec at 94Â°C</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55-63Â°C</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 min at 72Â°C</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were
          separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with
          ethidium bromide and visualized in a FluorImager
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnydale</ENAMEX>, CA). To determine
          conditions of log-linear amplification (with slope = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products from each dilution of cDNA template were
          quantified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> Image software.
