        Various smooth muscles differ in the content of
        contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and their isoforms, and these
        differences might contribute to manifestation of
        characteristic contractile phenotypes. For example, phasic
        and tonic behavior of gastrointestinal smooth muscles has
        been attributed to different expression levels of caldesmon
        and caldesmon-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but not to differences in
        the relative proportions of myosin, actin, calponin, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tropomyosin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Arteries and veins of different
        vascular beds are primarily composed of tonic smooth
        muscles. However these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of blood vessels serve
        distinct functions in the circulation, i.e. resistance vs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capacitance</ENAMEX>. The basis for the functional dissimilarities
        between the resistive and capacitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> is poorly
        understood, although various possibilities have been
        considered. Arterial walls, for example, include a
        substantial layer of smooth muscle, which provides
        efficient adjustment of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> to blood pressure changes.
        In contrast, the muscle layer of venous wall is thinner and
        veins better accommodate changes in blood volume.
        Differences in smooth muscle layer thickness, however, do
        not always satisfactorily explain why in some instances,
        including stimulation of postganglionic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX>,
        veins are more responsive than corresponding arteries [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Although differences in the type and amount of
        neurotransmitters, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor density</ENAMEX> and/or sensitivity for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotransmitter</ENAMEX> action, or signal transduction mechanisms
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to the contractile elements
        have been proposed to underlie the functional distinctions
        between capacitative and resistive regions of the
        mesenteric circulation, the possibility that mesenteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artery</ENAMEX> and vein convey distinct expression levels of
        contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has not been ruled out. The present
        study was carried out to determine whether the artery and
        vein form the same circulatory bed (i.e. mesenteric
        circulation) demonstrate differences in the expression
        levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> major contractile and thin filament-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, i.e. actin, myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (MHC), myosin
        light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (MLC), tropomyosin (TM), calponin, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caldesmon</ENAMEX>. We also compared the anatomical structure of the
        vessel walls to obtain basic information about the
        morphology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> under study, and to interpret the
        protein density measurements in relation to vessel wall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX>. Our experiments provide hints for understanding
        how the morphology and contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content might
        contribute to distinct functions of the arterial and venous
        sites of the splanchnic circulation. In addition, this
        study contributes to the relatively rare comparative
        studies on capacitative and resistive blood vessels from
        the 
        same vascular bed.
      
      
        Results
        
          Morphology of mesenteric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> and vein
          The gross <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of canine mesenteric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> and
          vein preparations was studied by conventional phase
          contrast microscopy. The walls of secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">180 ± 5 μm</NUMEX> in thickness and consisted of
          an inner endothelial layer (tunica intima), a tunica
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> and an outer tunica adventitia (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, Panel A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> sections of tunica <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> revealed that it consisted
          primarily of smooth muscle cells, averaging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 ± 0.5</NUMEX>
          cells in cross section (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fields of view, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>). Although, the structure of secondary and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tertiary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of mesenteric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> was similar, the
          smooth muscle layers of tertiary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.4</NUMEX>
          ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> smooth muscle cells in cross section (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, Panel</ENAMEX>
          B), and were notably thinner (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">130 ± 4 μm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>,
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
          Mesenteric veins and arteries exhibited similar gross
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, but expected differences were also observed
          in some individual structural elements. For example,
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> mesenteric vein consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>
          smooth muscle cells and had an average wall thickness of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 ± 4 μm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX>). Similarly, tertiary-branched
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenteric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">veins</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.3 ± 0.2</NUMEX> smooth muscle
          cells in cross section and were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 ± 2 μm</NUMEX> thick (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 1,</ENAMEX>
          Panel D, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fields of view for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>). These
          observations point to another structural difference:
          unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX>, the average number of smooth muscle
          cells per cross section, and thus the difference of wall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thickness</ENAMEX>, between secondary and tertiary veins, was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insignificant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P > 0.05</ENAMEX>).
          Ultrastructural details in vessel wall morphology were
          observed by electron microscopy of the canine mesenteric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artery</ENAMEX> and vein. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
          endothelium, smooth muscle cells and nerves within the
          artery. Endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> made close association with
          smooth muscle in regions of the inner aspect of the
          artery that was free of internal elastic lamina (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          Panel A). Within the tunica media, smooth muscle fibers
          were organized so that the long axis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> ran at
          an angle to circular axis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> wall (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          Panel B). These cells were tightly packed with thick and
          thin filaments and had many of the ultrastructural
          characteristics of smooth muscle cells including dense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and bands, occasional mitochondria, sacroplasmic
          reticulum, free ribosomes, caveolae and a basal lamina
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panels C</ENAMEX> and D). Elastic connective tissue and
          an abundance of collagen fibrils occupied intercellular
          spaces between smooth muscle cells. In the adventitial
          layer there was an abundance of collagen fibrils.
          Occasional nerve trunks containing several axons were
          observed adjacent to the external elastic lamina and
          often in regions were the lamina was disrupted. Nerve
          axons contained several types of vesicles including dense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cored</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron lucent vesicles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, Panel</ENAMEX>
          D).
          The overall ultrastructural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the
          mesenteric vein (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) was similar to that of the
          artery. The tunica <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> was primarily made up of smooth
          muscle cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix proteins</ENAMEX>, the
          tunica adventitia was made up of collagen fibrils, an
          external elastic lamina, occasional nerve processes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. Since the same set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> were
          observed in sections of either blood vessel wall, the
          characteristic feature that distinguishes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vein</ENAMEX> was wall thickness and number of smooth muscle cells
          that span through vessel wall.
        
        
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content of mesenteric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> and
          vein
          For these experiments we used mesenteric arteries and
          veins from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. The tissue homogenization
          conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] favor extraction of the major smooth
          muscle cell contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins actin</ENAMEX> and myosin, and
          the thin filament-binding components caldesmon, calponin,
          and tropomyosin (TM). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentrations
          determined in the clear homogenates from the artery
          decreased after each extraction cycle from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and were lower
          than the detectable minimum (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml) of the BCA micro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cycle. Likewise in the vein, the
          protein concentrations after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cycle were lower
          than the detectable level. Therefore, the protein
          extraction after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cycle was considered complete.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> supernatants from each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> and from each vein
          were pooled together, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentrations were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assayed</ENAMEX> again. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an average</TIMEX>, the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> yield was
          significantly higher from the artery than from the vein:
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.312 ± 0.024 mg</NUMEX>/mg dry tissue weight versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.225</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.016</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mg, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Thus,
          the calculated average ratio of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the
          artery versus vein was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content of mesenteric artery
          and vein
          To test whether differences in the total protein
          content were associated with differences in the content
          of individual contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we quantified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by using dilution series of purified protein
          standards, as illustrated with actin in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The band
          densities of increasing amounts of actin standards on
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunoblots</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, Panel A) were fitted to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> relationship (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panel B</ENAMEX>), which was then
          used to calculate the amounts of actin in extracts from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> and vein (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Panel C</ENAMEX>). As shown in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, densitometry of the immunoreactive actin bands and
          calculation of the actin amounts as a fraction of the
          separated total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, revealed a lack of difference
          between the artery and vein (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P > 0.05</ENAMEX>). Similar assays
          showed that the contents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">200 kDa</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa</ENAMEX>) were also indistinguishable in the artery and vein
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and so were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actin</ENAMEX>/MHC ratios: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.72</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.38</NUMEX>
          in the artery and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.59 ± 0.26</NUMEX> in vein (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P > 0.05</ENAMEX>).
          These data indicate that the fractions of the major motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, actin and myosin, are similar in both blood
          vessels.
          We assayed the contents of some thin filament binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, proposed to play roles in modulation of the
          actin-myosin coupling, e.g. calponin, caldesmon, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> pointed to a slightly bigger amount of calponin
          in the artery than vein, however the difference was not
          statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P > 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). There
          were significant differences in the content of caldesmon.
          The high molecular weight caldesmon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h-caldesmon</ENAMEX>) is the
          major isoform of intact vascular smooth muscle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . On
          the Western blots h-caldesmon appeared as a single band
          with apparent molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> kDa, which
          comigrated with h-caldesmon standard, purified from
          porcine stomach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Densitometry of immunoreactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bands</ENAMEX> revealed that the artery contained approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.39</NUMEX> times more h-caldesmon than vein (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropomyosin</ENAMEX> is a dimer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, composed of one heavy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> (TM-α, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> kDa) and one light subunit (TM-β, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kDa</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, Panel A). Analysis of the TM bands revealed
          a lack of significant difference of the total TM between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> and vein (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). However, differences were
          observed in the content of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> isoforms (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>): (i) both, the artery and vein had significantly
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM-α</ENAMEX> than TM-β; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>-α was
          bigger in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>-β was more abundant in
          vein. These TM isoform levels determined significantly
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM-α/TM</ENAMEX>-β ratios: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.26 ± 0.48</NUMEX> in the artery
          versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.87 ± 0.26</NUMEX> in vein (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The overall architecture and contents of individual
        contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are among the factors contributing to
        differences in the functional behavior of blood vessels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] . However, comparative information about <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> and
        veins from the same vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bed</ENAMEX> is usually scarce, as it
        is with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> and veins of the mesenteric
        circulation. In the present study we focused on identifying
        differences in the structure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of mesenteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterial</ENAMEX> and venous walls, which might help to better
        understand the physiology of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vascular beds. The
        primary structural difference was that secondary arterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> contain a greater number of smooth muscle cells
        within the tunica media and have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 10</NUMEX> times thicker
        smooth muscle layer than that of veins. Moreover, arterial
        smooth muscle cells have smaller intercellular gaps. This
        tighter arrangement suggests closer intercellular coupling
        and more efficient production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> during muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constriction</ENAMEX>; the arterial wall is thus better suited for
        vigorous mechanical resistance than the venous wall. From a
        structural point of view, mesenteric blood vessels comply
        with the general notion that arterial walls are thicker
        than venous walls from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>. Likewise, the
        walls of the arterial secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> are thicker
        compared to tertiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, consistent with the notion
        that a gradient of wall thickness is necessary for
        adjustments of the arterial network to rapid reduction of
        the blood pressure. Interestingly, however, secondary and
        tertiary mesenteric veins have almost identical thickness.
        It appears, therefore, that descending down the mesenteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, the contractile potential of arterial strips would
        decrease faster relative to that of veins. Thus, an
        awareness of the gradient of wall thickness might be useful
        in comprehending the relative potency of the artery and
        vein during comparative mechanical studies.
        From the thicker smooth muscle layer of mesenteric
        artery we obtained a greater amount of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> than
        from the thinner veins, but the fraction of the major motor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins actin</ENAMEX> and myosin, as well as of thin
        filament-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein calponin</ENAMEX>, was indistinguishable.
        An intriguing finding in this study was that the
        actin/myosin ratio in the canine mesenteric circulation
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~3.7</NUMEX> in the artery and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~3.6</NUMEX> in the vein) is higher than in
        aorta, carotid and coronary arteries (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2.6</NUMEX>), or in
        non-vascular smooth muscles (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1.5</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These
        observations suggest that the contractile protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX> might be inconsistent among vascular beds of
        one species, and might exhibit interspecies
        differences.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldesmon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        displayed quantitative differences between artery and vein.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldesmon</ENAMEX> is likely to play a modulatory role on the
        production of smooth muscle force via a tethering of actin
        to myosin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and/or of its effects on the actomyosin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> does not seem to
        function as a major regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, but modulatory
        effects due to its ability to maintain the actin
        filamentous structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , to inhibit the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-ATPase
        activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , alter the cytoskeletal dynamics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        and improve actin filament flexibility during the
        contraction/relaxation cycle [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] have been well
        documented. Differences in the content of caldesmon, or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> isoforms, therefore, might be associated with modulatory
        effects on the time profile or magnitude of contraction.
        Moreover, it has been recognized that caldesmon and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> can
        modulate the actin-myosin interaction in a cooperative
        manner [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , suggesting that functional effects of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> on actin-myosin coupling and smooth muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> ought to be interpreted in parallel. It remains
        to be determined whether the relatively bigger amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caldesmon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>-α is advantageous for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> in
        fulfilling resistive functions, and whether more TM-β is a
        prerequisite for veins to fulfill capacitative functions in
        the mesenteric circulation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results of this study confirm previous studies that
        thicker and more tightly assembled smooth muscle layer,
        rather than the profile of the major contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        is the likely cause for a higher mechanical potential of
        the mesenteric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> compared to vein. While in various
        circumstances the mesenteric veins display a greater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX> to contractile stimuli than the
        corresponding arteries [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 21</ENAMEX> ] , this difference should be
        attributed to the specificity of the neuroeffector
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coupling</ENAMEX>, or to signal transduction mechanisms underlying
        the functional distinctions between capacitative and
        resistive regions of the mesenteric circulation.

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> and veins used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> biochemistry
          experiments were perfused with distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min
          to remove endothelium. In previous experiments we have
          shown that this procedure successfully removes the
