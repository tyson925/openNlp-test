        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> like many enteric
        and soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> can respire anaerobically by using a
        variety of amine-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-oxides and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-sulfoxides</ENAMEX> as electron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptors</ENAMEX>. This ability depends on the regulated synthesis
        of a membrane bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (dimethylsulfoxide) and/or TMAO
        (trimethylamine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX>) reductase enzyme. Use of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> occurs by a broad substrate
        enzyme encoded by the 
        dmsABC operon located at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>
        on the chromosome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold activation of 
        dmsABC gene expression in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaerobiosis</ENAMEX> is controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fnr</ENAMEX> regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] . Following a re-examination, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsABC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> start site
        was located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">223 nucleotides</NUMEX> upstream of the translational
        start of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . This centers the Fnr
        binding site (TTGATnnnnAACAA) at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-41.5 bp</ENAMEX> from the 
        dmsABC P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> as also
        established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> footprinting analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The
        presence of nitrate, a preferred alternative electron
        acceptor, elicits a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold repression of 
        dmsABC expression via the NarXLQP
        two-component regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 9 10</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nitrate</ENAMEX> is
        detected by either of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two sensor</NUMEX>-transmitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarX</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarQ</ENAMEX>, which then activate the DNA binding
        response-regulatory protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL</ENAMEX>, by phosphorylating an
        aspartate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> located at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>. NarL-phosphate
        then negatively regulates 
        dmsABC operon expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of 
        dmsABC expression have also been
        described that involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">molybdenum</ENAMEX> dependent gene expression
        via the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ModE</ENAMEX> transcription factor, and integration host
        factor (IHF) that interacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at a downstream site
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 11 12</NUMEX> ] . Neither the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMAO</ENAMEX> nor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>, substrates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> reductase, further modulate 
        dmsABC gene expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6</NUMEX> ] .
        In this study, the control of 
        dmsABC gene expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> and
        NarL was investigated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mutagenesis of the Fnr</ENAMEX> recognition
        sequence at the

        dmsABC expression and explored the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX> and spacing requirements for the Fnr
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> site at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. The region of 
        dmsA promoter DNA protected by the
        NarL regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I and</ENAMEX>
        hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments. These studies
        define the molecular interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> at the 
        dmsABC P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> that together
        provide for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nitrate</ENAMEX> regulated expression of
        this respiratory pathway operon.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Effect of cis-acting mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> binding
          site on anaerobic induction of dmsA-lacZexpression
          To investigate the effects of sequence changes in the 
          dmsA Fnr-recognition site on the
          anaerobic activation of 
          dmsA-lacZ expression, site-directed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> and Î²-galactosidase assays were performed
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Since the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fnr</ENAMEX> binding site at the 
          dmsA P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> differs from the
          Fnr consensus recognition sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTGATnnnnATCAA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          ) by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">base pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) in the right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site (e.g., A 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCAA</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fnr-</ENAMEX>site was
          converted to the consensus sequence and analyzed for
          Î²-galactosidase activity under both aerobic and anaerobic
          conditions. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold increase in anaerobic activation of 
          dmsA-lacZ expression was observed
          for the consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> site (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-fold) relative to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX>-fold anaerobic activation by Fnr seen for the native 
          dmsA sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î»JA303</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">»JA250</ENAMEX>, respectively). The Î»JA303 consensus mutant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fnr</ENAMEX> +strain exhibited a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>-fold
          anaerobic increase in Î²-galactosidase expression relative
          to the corresponding 
          fnr -strain (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,200</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          units). To our knowledge, this "consensus" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fnr</ENAMEX>-dependent 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> exhibits the highest
          anaerobic induction of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fnr</ENAMEX>-regulated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> promoter examined. The
          enhanced ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> to activate 
          dmsABC gene expression is possibly,
          by analogy to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crp</ENAMEX>, due to increased affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> at
          the consensus versus the native non-consensus Fnr
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> sequence at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsA</ENAMEX> . Likewise, the poor match of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> site at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> for the fumarate reductase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frdA</ENAMEX> to the consensus Fnr sequence
          may account for the relatively weak anaerobic induction
          for this respiratory operon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
          Several additional DNA sequence changes were
          introduced into the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region to alter the
          Fnr recognition sequence as well as to alter the spacing
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> site and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase recognition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A single base substitution in the
          left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site when combined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> consensus
          sequence at the right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX>-fold
          activation of 
          dmsA-lacZ expression (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">»JA450</ENAMEX>), an induction equivalent to the wild-type 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> that has the
          symmetrical deviation in the right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site (ca.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX>-fold). Thus, the left and right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites are
          equivalent in their ability to confer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX>-dependent
          activation of 
          dmsA gene expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>. This is in contrast to the requirement for
          the left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fnr1</NUMEX> regulatory site needed for
          Fnr-dependent repression at the 
          cydA P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . When a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>-pair change was introduced into the left Fnr
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTGAT</ENAMEX> to TT 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG T</ENAMEX>) of the native 
          dmsA sequence, it nearly abolished
          the anaerobic induction of 
          dmsA-lacZ expression (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">»JA257</ENAMEX>). The deletion of the entire left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site Fnr
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, while preserving the right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site as
          consensus, exhibited similar results (Î<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">»JA304</ENAMEX>). Hence, a
          single Fnr <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-site is not sufficient to allow
          Fnr-dependent activation of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DMSO reductase genes</ENAMEX>.
          To evaluate how the spacing between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> binding
          site and the start of 
          dmsA transcription alters the
          anaerobic activation of 

          dmsA-lacZ expression, single
          basepair insertions were introduced at position -35
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(Î</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">»JA448 and Î»JA449</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX>-fold anaerobic activation
          seen for the wild-type 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was reduced to about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35-fold</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the two mutants</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), indicating
          that the position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> site at the wild-type 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is important for
          controlling optimal 
          dmsA gene expression. Thus, the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> exhibits a preference
          for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-41.5</NUMEX> target sites like other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fnr</ENAMEX>-regulated class II
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . By analogy to the CAP transcription
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , the proposed mechanism for Fnr
          activation of gene expression involves its ability to
          promote open complex formation by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 16</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . As suggested by the appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I</ENAMEX>
          hypersensitive cleavage sites, a change in the DNA
          conformation occurs upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fnr</ENAMEX> binding at the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . The
          presence of hypersensitive DNase I cleavage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at
          other FNR-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> bending
          experiments support this conclusion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 20</ENAMEX> ] .
          Furthermore, recent studies propose the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interaction of Ïƒ 70and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> at the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">narG</ENAMEX> and 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 21 22 23</ENAMEX> ] .
          Finally, for each of the site-directed mutations of the
          Fnr binding site in this study, the level of 
          dmsA-lacZ expression was not
          significantly altered in an 
          fnr deletion strain either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerobically</ENAMEX> or anaerobically, indicating that the
          Fnr-independent expression from the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was not affected by
          the sequence alterations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Location of NarL</ENAMEX> binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at the

          ] . Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> putative NarL <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> have been proposed
          based on their similarity to a NarL consensus recognition
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TACYYMT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> = C or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> = A or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] ,
          no 
          in vivo or 
          in vitro information is available
          regarding the location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> site(s) within the 
          dmsA regulatory region. To evaluate
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> binds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">footprinting</ENAMEX> experiments were
          performed using a 
          dmsA promoter fragment
          corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-127</NUMEX> to + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> relative to the start of
          transcription at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL-phosphate</ENAMEX> was incubated
          with the coding strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> bp region was
          protected that extends from position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-48</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+28</NUMEX> relative
          to the start of 
          dmsA transcription (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, open
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rectangle</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> hypersensitive cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were
          seen at positions <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+32, +31, +30, +18, +4, -18, -19, -41,</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-53</NUMEX> relative to the start of transcription.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I</ENAMEX> footprint of the non-coding strand of 
          dmsA with phosphorylated NarL
          revealed an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> bp protected region that extends from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-51</NUMEX>
          to +32 relative to the start of transcription (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> hypersensitive cutting was observed at positions
          +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+4, +3, -10, -20, -21, -22</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-32</NUMEX>. For the
          non-coding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA strand</ENAMEX>, the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I</ENAMEX> footprint
          pattern appears to increase when higher levels of
          NarL-phosphate are present. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I</ENAMEX> protection first
          occurs within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+10</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-15</NUMEX> region followed by an
          extension to the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-25</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-50</NUMEX> region and then finally the
          +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> region. The size of the protected region did not
          change further when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five</NUMEX>-fold higher amounts of
          NarL-phosphate were used (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX>, data not shown). Thus,
          the sizes of the protected regions on each strand concur.
          Furthermore, non-phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL</ENAMEX> gave no DNase I
          protections in the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region under the same
          conditions for either strand (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 10 Î¼M</NUMEX>), suggesting
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL-phosphate</ENAMEX>, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL</ENAMEX>, can act as a
          transcriptional repressor for 
          dmsA expression. The protections
          for both strands are consistent with the binding of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> molecules of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
          Hydroxyl radical footprinting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> interactions
          with 
          dmsA promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was also
          performed for both strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>). In
          hydroxyl radical footprinting, the small, highly reactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hydroxyl radical (â€¢OH</ENAMEX>) attacks the deoxyribose sugars
          along the DNA backbone with no sequence or base
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>, thereby providing a high resolution of
          structural information [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> distinct hydroxyl radical protected regions were
          observed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five</NUMEX> basepairs in size for each DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> that extended over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">bp region</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          These NarL-phosphate protections extended from position
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59 to +38</NUMEX>, consistent with the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">footprinting</ENAMEX> experiments described above. The hydroxyl
          radical protected regions for the 
          dmsA strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were offset by
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 bp</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' direction (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This offset suggests
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> either occludes the minor groove of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA conformation</ENAMEX> is distorted upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL</ENAMEX>
          binding. In the former case, the DNA backbone sites
          located closest to one another are across the minor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groove</ENAMEX> and separated in sequence by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> bp [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> proposal is supported by a recent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> angstrom
          NarL-DNA structure for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX>-C-terminal domain complexed
          to a synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-2-7 NarL</ENAMEX> consensus binding site where
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> causes a conformational change of B-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to
          A-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (Ann Maris</ENAMEX>, personal communication). Furthermore,
          the hydroxyl radical protected regions occur at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, a regular phasing of the helix repeat. This
          signifies that NarL-phosphate binds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> side of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> molecule 
          dmsA promoter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30</NUMEX>
          ] . The hydroxyl radical data are also consistent with
          the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> molecules of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NarL</ENAMEX>-phosphate to
          the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region as suggested
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> data. Therefore, a simple model that
          accounts for the footprint data is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multiple NarL</ENAMEX>-phosphate molecules onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> face of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that somehow protect the minor groove from hydroxyl
          radical attack [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . In an alternative model,
          NarL binds only at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">NarL</ENAMEX> heptamer
          consensus sites spaced at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> bp intervals within the 
          dmsA regulatory region (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          However, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is difficult to envision since the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns extend
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> turns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
          By either of the above models, the location of the
          NarL-phosphate protected regions suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> may
          compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> for occupancy on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> but only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are grown
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaerobically</ENAMEX> in the presence of nitrate, conditions
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> is in the activated form. No hydroxyl radical
          or DNase I protected regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> were observed when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-phosphorylated NarL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was used at a
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> (data not shown). In addition,
          Î²-galactosidase assays revealed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> nitrate
          dependent repression of 
          dmsA-lacZ expression was unaffected
          by the deletion of upstream DNA sequence to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-71</NUMEX> relative
          to the start of 
          dmsA transcription, further
          pinpointing the location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the NarL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> site for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsA</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Furthermore,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> footprint pattern does not extend into the 
          dmsA P2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region. Therefore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> does not appear to directly affect regulation at the
          P2 site, unless a large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that involves
          multiple transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> is involved (i.e.
          Fnr, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NarL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ModE</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHF</ENAMEX> in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAP</ENAMEX>). Future
          investigation of this complex regulatory region will be
          needed to ascertain such a matter. Finally, a similar
          hydroxyl radical footprint pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8-9</ENAMEX> protected
          regions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-4 bp spaced 10 nucleotides</NUMEX> apart was also
          observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NarL</ENAMEX>-phosphate at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region of the
          
          frdA gene, another anaerobically
          induced gene that is repressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nitrate</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          To establish if the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> protected region is
          required for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NarL</ENAMEX>-phosphate to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment
          (designated Fragment B, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) containing a truncated
          region of the 
          dmsA regulatory sequence was
          constructed. The fragment extends from position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-127</NUMEX> to
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> relative to the start of 
          dmsA transcription at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fragment B</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consensus heptamer
          sites have been replaced by the multi-cloning region of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGEM-11Zf</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). When examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase I</ENAMEX>
          footprinting analysis, the altered 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsA Fragment</ENAMEX> B (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) revealed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp NarL-phosphate</ENAMEX> protected region
          extending from position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-51</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-13</NUMEX>. This protected region
          spans only the wild-type 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> but not the
          adjacent foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the
          full-length 
          dmsA fragment (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fragment A</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-127</NUMEX> to
          +<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>) showed a larger protected region from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-51</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+32</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 2-5</ENAMEX>). These findings demonstrate that the smaller 
          dmsA region containing only one of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consensus heptamer sites (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) is
          sufficient for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> binding. However, a somewhat weaker
          binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NarL</ENAMEX>-phosphate to the DNA fragment containing
          the truncated 
          dmsA region relative to the
          full-length region may suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> binds at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in a weakly cooperative fashion. The protections
          are consistent with the proposal that NarL-phosphate
          recognizes and binds at multiple heptamer recognition
          sites within the 
          dmsA P1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">putative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL</ENAMEX> binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with the consensus
          heptameric sequence (TACYYMT) have been proposed for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>,
          previously assigned at positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">+8</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-14 and -34</NUMEX>, are now
          centered at positions + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-7</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-27</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) due to
          the reassignment of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX> start site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Since
          the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase I and</ENAMEX> hydroxyl radical footprints
          in this study show DNA protections between and beyond
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consensus sites, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may
          be present in this region. As the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consensus NarL
          boxes flank the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and are spaced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> bp
          apart (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), the spacing and orientation of the NarL
          protected regions make it tempting to speculate that
          NarL-phosphate binds at each site. Additional
          NarL-phosphate monomers then assemble on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to form
          a stable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, molecules of
          NarL-phosphate may bind at both the consensus and at
          related NarL-box sequences that contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or two
          mismatches from consensus (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Inspection of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA</ENAMEX> reveals an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> box within the protected
          region that has one mismatch from consensus (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>,
          dashed arrows) and nineteen NarL-like boxes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mismatches</ENAMEX> (dotted arrows, not all shown). We note that
          none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consensus heptamers (solid arrows,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) are arranged in a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7-2-7</ENAMEX> sequence, nor are any
          of the consensus heptamers paired with any of the
          mismatch heptamers in such an arrangement. This is
          noteworthy since a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7-2-7</ENAMEX> sequence has been speculated for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleating NarL</ENAMEX> interactions at other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoichiometry</ENAMEX> experiments are planned to ascertain the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NarL</ENAMEX> molecules that bind the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region, as are
          studies to mutagenize one or more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> binding
          sites to determine the importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> consensus
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study investigated the effects of sequence changes
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fnr</ENAMEX>-recognition site on the anaerobic activation of 
        dmsA-lacZ expression as well as
        examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> recognition sites within the 
        dmsABC regulatory region. The data
        illustrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> is responsible for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold
        anaerobic activation of 
        dmsA expression. Also, both
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-sites of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> recognition sequence at 
        dmsA are required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX>-dependent
        expression and are similar in their ability to activate 
        dmsA transcription. Furthermore, the
        spacing between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fnr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase recognition
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> is critical at 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dmsA</ENAMEX> . 
        In vitro interactions of the
        nitrate-responsive regulatory protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NarL</ENAMEX> with the
        promoter region of 
        dmsABC were examined using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase I</ENAMEX>
        and hydroxyl radical footprinting techniques. The location
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NarL</ENAMEX>-phosphate protected regions within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a 97 bp</TIMEX>
        segment of the 
        dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is consistent with the
        model for 
        dmsABC expression whereby multiple
        molecules of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NarL</ENAMEX>-phosphate recognize and bind to the DNA
        in a weak and cooperative fashion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> interactions
        with the 
        dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region occurred at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> intervals and were offset by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 bp</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' direction,
        suggesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of multiple NarL-phosphate
        molecules onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that protect the minor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">groove</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonphosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL</ENAMEX> was unable to
        protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> binding sequences at the 
        dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region, suggesting that
        phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NarL</ENAMEX> is required for repression of 
        dmsABC expression.

          the bacteriophage used in this study are listed in Table

          solid LB medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Ampicillin was added as needed
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. For Î²</ENAMEX>-galactosidase assays, cells were grown

          Construction of dmsA-lacZoperon fusions
          To introduce mutations within or nearby the proposed
          Fnr recognition site at the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, site-directed
          mutagenesis was performed using the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kunkel</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
          ] . The template for mutagenesis was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">m13mp19</NUMEX>-100 which
          contained a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">676 bp</ENAMEX> 
          Bam HI fragment containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">587 bp</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> upstream of the

          the associated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">89 bp</NUMEX> of the 
          dmsA coding region. Each intended
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hinc II</ENAMEX>/ 
          Bam HI fragment containing the

          inserted into the plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRS1274</TIMEX> to give <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the JA250</TIMEX> (wild

          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lac Z</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter fusions</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          These fusions were inserted into the chromosome in single

          Î²-Galactosidase assays
          Î²-Galactosidase activity was determined as previously
          described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration was estimated
          by assuming that a cell density at OD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> corresponds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> Î¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> per ml [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Î²-galactosidase activity is
          expressed in nanomol ONPG <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hydrolyzed per min</NUMEX> per mg
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Values for Î²-galactosidase activity represent
          the average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more experiments and the values
          varied no more than plus or minus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> from the mean.
        
        
          Footprint analysis
          A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bp DNA fragment</ENAMEX> containing the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region was used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA footprinting</ENAMEX> experiments. The fragment, corresponding
          to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-127</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+62</NUMEX> relative to the start of transcription,
          was amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using primers

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'GGGAATTCGCTATATAGGCTTGTATACATCGAA'3</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">oSB14</NUMEX>) with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pPC25</ENAMEX> as template. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was digested
          with either the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eco RI</ENAMEX> or 
          Xba I restriction enzyme,
          end-labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">[Î±P 32</ENAMEX>]-dATP (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN, Inc.</ENAMEX>) using the
          Klenow fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase I, and purified using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> clean-up kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>). A smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment
          representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region from
          position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-127</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-13</NUMEX> relative to the start of
          transcription was also constructed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification
          using pPC25 as template and oligonucleotides <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">oSB15</ENAMEX> and
          oSB21 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5'GTAGTATTACTAGTAAGTGAGG'3</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was
          digested with the restriction enzymes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Xba I and</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Spe I and cloned</ENAMEX> into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Xba I-digested pGEM-IIZf</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>).
          Only the 
          Xba I site designed near the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-127</NUMEX>
          region remained intact. Using the resulting plasmid pSB10
          as template, the cloned product was PCR amplified with
          the vector forward and reverse primers, digested with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and labeled as described
          above, resulting in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fragment</ENAMEX> B (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> footprinting assays were carried out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 Î</TIMEX>¼l
          of binding buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pH7.5</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> mM

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ng poly-(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dI-dC</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> glycerol)
          with a final DNA concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> nM. NarL was purified
          and phosphorylated using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetyl phosphate</ENAMEX> as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Following phosphorylation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NarL</ENAMEX> was
          immediately diluted to the indicated concentrations and
          DNA binding was allowed to proceed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) was added (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:250</ENAMEX> dilution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          mg ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-1stock</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) and incubation continued for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22Â°C</TIMEX>. Reactions were stopped by the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          Î¼l of stop buffer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M ETDA</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sodium

          precipitation, the samples were resuspended in loading
          dye, subjected to electrophoresis on an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> polyacrylamide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gel</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 M urea</ENAMEX>, and detected by autoradiography.
          Maxam-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> sequencing reactions were performed as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
          Hydroxyl radical footprinting at the 
          dmsA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was performed as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . NarL binding to the indicated DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> was performed as described above, omitting
          glycerol from the binding buffer. Following the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> min
          binding reaction, a freshly prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> cleavage mixture
          was added (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Î¼l each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM L-ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>
