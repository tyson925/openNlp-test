          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          Identify the unique symbols in the analyzed sequences.
          For a nucleotide sequence the unique symbols would be A,
          G, C, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> found in DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          Map each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> to a unique corner in the unit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercube</ENAMEX>. The dimension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> hypercube, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , is chosen as the upper integer
          of 
          log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uu</ENAMEX> ) where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uu</ENAMEX> is the number of unique symbols.
          Therefore 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> has the value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. For each symbol mapped in such a way, let 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           be the

          th coordinate of the corner of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypercube</ENAMEX> to which symbol 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> is mapped. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible
          mapping is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          A = [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,0</NUMEX>], 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          C = [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>], 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          G = [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,0</NUMEX>], and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,1</NUMEX>]. There are sparser
          implementations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> that may use values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> up to the number of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>,
          
          uu , as detailed in the original
          proposition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . However, those solutions are not
          essentially different and the implementation presented
          here can be straightforwardly ported to sparser USM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">representations</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          Iteratively generate the forward USM coordinates for
          each of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> symbols and each of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> coordinates as follows
          
        
        
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          Iteratively generate the backward USM coordinates for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> and each coordinate as follows
          
          The given procedure results in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n USM</ENAMEX> coordinates for each of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> symbols in the transformed
          sequence. The similarity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> at any pair of
          symbols can be measured using the distance measure
          defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinga</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The measure is
          defined by
          
          D = 
          d 
          
            f 
           ( 
          a 
          
            i 
           
          b 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           ) + 
          d 
          
            b 
           ( 
          a 
          
            i 
           
          b 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">) â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
          where
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinga</ENAMEX> present the distance measure as an
          estimator of the length of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> containing
          the compared symbols. They also note that the measure, as
          defined, necessarily overestimates the length of these
          segments.
          As can be seen in the USM procedure, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in
          the sequence is encoded as a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> coordinates.
          These coordinates are constructed in such a way as to
          encode the symbol itself as well as the preceding symbols
          (forward coordinates) and following symbols (backward
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinates</ENAMEX>). Scale independence is a property of this
          representation that allows the complete recovery of the
          encompassing sequence (preceding and following symbols)
          from the USM coordinates of any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in the sequence to
          any resolution (any scale) up to the complete length of
          the sequence. In practical implementations we are faced
          with the limitations of finite word length
          representations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> coordinates. In these
          implementations our ability to recover the encompassing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is bounded by the word length of the coordinate
          representation. For this reason, we refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> and bUSM
          implementations with finite precision coordinates as
          bounded scale independent representations. In this paper
          we consider the implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> algorithm and
          propose a modification to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinga</ENAMEX>'s approach [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] that eliminates the overestimation and allows
          determination of similar segment lengths of bounded
          length and offer an algorithm for overcoming the bounded
          length restriction.

          Source of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> distance metric
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimation
          The application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> as a tool for measuring
          scale-independent discrete sequence similarity and its
          particular application to genomics and proteomics
          exploits a distance metric providing an estimate of the
          length of similar regions surrounding a pair of symbols.
          In the approach presented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinga</ENAMEX>, this
          distance metric is shown to overestimate the true length
          of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. We propose a variation on their
          approach that retains the distance property, eliminates
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimation, and uses more computationally
          efficient operations. We begin this discussion by first
          providing a more complete proof of the distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimation</ENAMEX> in the unidirectional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX>. This proof aids
          in the illumination of the source of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-estimation.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> distance metric estimates the length of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ungapped</ENAMEX> identical segments in the region surrounding the
          symbols being compared. As such, we now consider two
          sequences, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> symbols in agreement starting at
          symbol indices 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            v 
           and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
           respectively.
          
          From the definition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> recursion (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 1</ENAMEX>)
          we can see that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">j thcoordinate</ENAMEX> at the k thstep can
          also be written as
          
          Where the is the j thcoordinate of the k thsymbol and
          the are determined by the initial values of the
          coordinates. These values are assigned in the
          initialization step of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> encoding process. We write
          a coordinate of the sequence at the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            v 
           thand 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thstep</ENAMEX> in the recursion as:
          
          These representations are given as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> summations
          corresponding to the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> symbols in agreement, the symbols
          preceding the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> back to the beginning of
          each sequence, and the initial value of the coordinate.
          From our definition of these sequences ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> most recent symbols in agreement)
          we see that that the first terms (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> summation) in
          each of the expressions are equal. We can factor a common
          term from each of the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">summations</ENAMEX> giving
          
          By change of index we get
          
          We let , , and for the non-similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">independent Bernoulli</ENAMEX> random variables with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX>. The term in brackets is
          recognized as a uniformly distributed random value on
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>). We can rewrite 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USMv</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USMw</ENAMEX> as follows
          
          Where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rv</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           and 
          Rw 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           are uniformly distributed on [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>). Next consider
          the differences between the USM coordinates for each of
          these sequences.
          
          The terms in the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> are eliminated and
          the difference becomes a scaled difference between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniformly</ENAMEX> distributed random variables. The scale factor
          of this difference gives the length of the similar
          segment.
          The unidirectional distance metric given by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinga</ENAMEX> is defined as

          the USM vector. Exploiting the fact that 
          log is monotone increasing we
          substitute our expression for the USM difference and
          write 
          d as:

          the distribution of Ï† can be determined as follows
          
          This confirms the result originally reported by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinga</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . We see from this derivation
          that the exact length of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, given by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> , is determined by the exponent
          of the common factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> factored from the non-similar
          segment. The remaining factor in that term constitutes
          the overestimation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overestimation</ENAMEX> is, therefore,
          determined by the difference between terms in the series
          representation of the maximum coordinate difference
          beyond the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. The symbol sequence encoded
          in this portion of the coordinate provides no information
          as to the length of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> and so we wish to
          eliminate its effect on the estimation of the similar
          length.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> USMs
          It is clear from the discussion above that
          overestimation of the length of similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> by USM
          results from contributions to the coordinate difference
          from terms in the coordinate summation preceding the
          similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. This effect is due to the use of an
          arithmetic difference in the computation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinga</ENAMEX>'s distance metric. Consider the following
          example
          
          where 
          R 
          
            a 
           and 
          R 
          
            b 
           are the uniformly distributed random values on [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>)
          described in the previous derivation. Finite length
          coordinates are used here for illustration purposes.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quantities must differ in the most significant
          position but are not constrained in the remaining terms.
          In this example we see that for the least significant
          subtraction to occur, the difference must borrow from the
          next more significant term. The borrow propagates the
          length of the sum and the length is overestimated, in
          this case, by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The overestimation is therefore, due to
          the interaction of the symbols prior to the first symbol
          at which the sequences differ.
          We propose a variation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> encoding and
          difference metric in which arithmetic operations
          (subtraction, maximum, and base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> logarithm) are replaced
          with equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boolean</ENAMEX> operations in which the values of
          individual terms in the above expression do not interact.
          We now present the proposed change of arithmetic.
          Consider the following representation of a bUSM
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX>) coordinate
          
          c = 
          R 
          i 
          a 
          
            i 
           
          where 
          a 
          
            i 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">âˆˆ</ENAMEX> {<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">} â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>)
          Where represents the bit-wise logical OR of a series
          of terms and 
          R 
          i is the right shift operator
          repeated 
          i times. The value 
          c is then an infinite bit
          representation that encodes one bit from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in
          the encoded sequence. The bUSM recursion is then written
          as
          
          The representation of a coordinate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> after
          the k thstep of the recursion is given by
          
          Again, consider <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two sequences</TIMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> , as defined previously. We write
          the coordinates of these sequences at the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            v 
           thand 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thstep</ENAMEX> in the recursion as:
          
          As before, we break the representation into three
          terms; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> representing the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, one
          representing terms prior to the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, and one
          representing the initial value of the coordinate. The
          proposed recursion replaces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> with a right
          shift operation and addition with a bit-wise logical OR.
          Resulting coordinates are histories of one bit of the
          symbols preceding the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> with the most recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbol</ENAMEX>'s bit stored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>most bit position (most
          significant position).
          Given the proposed coordinate representation and
          recursion, we now examine the bit-wise binary equivalent
          to the computation of the distance metric. Consider the
          exclusive OR of the coordinates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> symbols being
          compared.
          
          The exclusive OR operation yields true (bit is set) if
          the bits differ and false (bit is not set) otherwise.
          Based on our definition of sequences 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> and 
          W none of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> in the similar
          segment of the newly defined bUSM coordinate difference
          are set and the first bit beyond the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> must
          be set. The exact length of the similar segment is given
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> less than the position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>most set bit in
          the set of coordinate differences.
          Under the original approach, the maximum of the
          differences across all coordinates is taken prior to
          computing the base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> logarithm. Under the proposed
          approach we replace this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> with the bit-wise OR
          of the differences across all coordinates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>most
          bit set in the result corresponds to the bUSM coordinate
          that determines the length of the similar segment
          (equivalent to the coordinate winning the max operation
          in the standard USM). The computation of the distance
          metric in the original approach employs a base-2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">logarithm</ENAMEX>. Under the proposed approach we substitute the
          logarithm with a scan for the position of the most
          significant bit set in the bit-wise OR of the coordinate
          differences. By forming both the forward and reverse bUSM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinates</ENAMEX> and adding the forward and backward
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>, the exact length of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> can be
          determined for all pairs within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>.
          For the standard USM, initial values for coordinates
          are taken as random draws on [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,1</NUMEX>). This allows the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> properties of the overestimation to remain
          consistent at the beginning and end of the sequences. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX> does not overestimate the similar length and
          we must, therefore, reexamine the initialization approach
          so as to preserve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of exact lengths at
          the beginning and end of the sequences. This can be
          accomplished through the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unique symbols,
          a tail symbol for sequence V and a tail symbol for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sequence W.</ENAMEX> The use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> special symbols to mark the
          ends of the sequences results in no change to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recursion</ENAMEX> or similar segment length determination. It
          does impact the initialization and possibly the
          computational costs due to a potential increase in the
          number of coordinates required to represent the alphabet
          and the tail symbols. The addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extra symbols
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will</ENAMEX>, in some cases, increase the number of coordinates
          required. If, for example, an alphabet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> is required,
          the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> symbols increases the number of
          coordinates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3</TIMEX>. If, however, an alphabet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          is required, the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> symbols results in no
          increase in the number of coordinates. Naturally, this
          would not ever happen for a sparse implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX>,
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uu</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and, consequently, the
          number of coordinates increases with every new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>.
          Nevertheless, this would not, in any way, change the bUSM
          proposition as the sole difference between sparse and
          compact representations concerns the binary
          representation of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,...</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uu</ENAMEX>  . It is noteworthy,
          however, that the incentive to use sparser USM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">representations</ENAMEX>, which is the smaller extent of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-determination, does not exist for bUSM, where
          determination of length unit identity is exact, as shown
          below.
          The initial value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX> coordinates for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence V</ENAMEX> are set to indicate that an occurrence of the
          sequence V tail symbol precedes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. An</ENAMEX>
          instance of the tail symbol is also added to the end of
          the sequence (follows the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in V). The initial
          value for sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>'s coordinates are set similarly
          using the sequence W tail symbol. Since tail symbols
          differ from each other and from all non-tail symbols,
          similar regions will be terminated at the beginning and
          end of the sequence and exact distances will be
          determined as required.
          Both forms of the USM coordinates can be considered a
          form of embedding and reorientation of the sequence data
          as illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Instead of coding the
          information as a sequence of symbol codes, we code it as
          a collection of coordinates containing one code bit for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> in the sequence. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> coordinate stores
          one bit for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> preceding (forward coordinates)
          or following (backward coordinates) the symbol associated
          with the coordinate. The sequence of coordinates
          redundantly embeds the symbols surrounding the current
          symbol.
          The standard USM coordinates can be directly obtained
          from the bUSM form by interpreting the bUSM coordinates
          as block floating point representations of the USM
          coordinates with the binary decimal point set to the left
          of the most significant bit. Dividing the unsigned word
          representation of the bUSM coordinate by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> , where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> is the word length, yields the
          equivalent standard USM coordinate with 
          W symbols of precision. We also
          recognize that for both the standard and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> USM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinates</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of similar segment lengths
          is limited by the length (or precision) of the word used
          to represent the coordinate. The original implementation
          of the standard USM was created in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matlab</ENAMEX> and used <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64-bit</NUMEX>
          floating point coordinates. As such, lengths for similar
          segments <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 53 symbols</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IEEE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">754</ENAMEX> format provides
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">53 bits</NUMEX> of precision [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ) cannot be determined. The
          bUSM coordinates are similarly limited. The comparable
          implementation encodes bUSM coordinates in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64-bit</NUMEX> fixed
          point representations and so exact similar segment
          lengths up to a maximum length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> can be
          determined.
        
        
          Overcoming finite word length limitations
          In theory, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> encoded sequences could be used to
          detect arbitrarily long similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. Previously we
          discuss the constraint imposed by finite-length binary
          representations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> and bUSM coordinates. An algorithm
          for overcoming this limitation will now be presented.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> we define <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following two</TIMEX> functions
          
          Under the finite word length limitation we note that 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           , the true forward and backward distances, cannot be
          determined from a single symbol pair comparison. We
          define <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new functions and which can be determined from
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W -bit</ENAMEX> coordinate representations.
          These functions provide the length of similar segments up
          to the length of the underlying representation 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> . The true length of the forward
          and backward similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are returned for lengths
          less than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX> and the word length is returned
          otherwise. Next we present the following recursive
          functions
          
          The functions 
          D 
          
            f 
           and 
          D 
          
            b 
           recursively locate the end of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> by
          stepping backward ( 
          D 
          
            f 
           ) and forward ( 
          D 
          
            b 
           ) through the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> until the end of the
          region is detected. The exact forward and backward
          lengths of similar segments of arbitrary length can be
          determined from these recursions. If the similar segment
          extends to the end of the sequence, the recursion will
          terminate on the last step due to the tail symbols added
          to the beginning and end of the sequence. The exact
          length of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> containing symbols 
          v 
          
            i 
           and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           is given by
          
          The proposed recursive definition of similar segment
          length overcomes the finite word length limitation and
          provides a practical method for recovering exact
          distances for arbitrarily long similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Performance comparisons
          Computational comparisons of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches were
          performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>code implementations developed as
          described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>. This comparison examines the
          performance gains achieved through the use of binary
          operations (shift, exclusive OR, OR, bit scan) as
          replacements for the equivalent functions in the standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, subtraction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX>, and log). Since the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX> requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional symbols to represent
          the tail symbols for each of the sequences, three
          coordinates are required for each of the forward and
          reverse directions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> total). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> coordinates were
          required for the standard USM. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard USM</ENAMEX> coordinates
          were stored as 64 bit floating point numbers and bUSM
          coordinates as 64 bit unsigned fixed point numbers. The
          standard and binary USM implementations were, therefore,
          limited to detecting similar segments up to lengths <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> respectively in a single comparison (not using the
          recursive distance algorithm).
          Elapsed execution time measurements were made for each
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> test cases and are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. For
          small sequence lengths (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10,000</NUMEX> symbols) the
          symbol-pair distance calculations for the binary USM
          achieved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 8.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> comparisons per second on
          our test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> while the standard USM achieved rates
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> comparisons per second. The binary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> approach was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3.7</NUMEX> times the speed of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard USM</ENAMEX>. For these small sequence test cases, the
          test application and the USM representations of the small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> fit within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processor</ENAMEX>'s on-chip cache (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">512</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kilobytes</ENAMEX>). For cases where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> encoded sequences
          exceed the cache size and require reads from main memory,
          the performance decreases as indicated for the larger
          cases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> symbols and above). For these cases, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binary</ENAMEX> USM executes at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> comparisons per second and
          the standard USM at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> comparisons per second for a
          performance ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.9</NUMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> examples applying both the standard and binary USM
          approaches were prepared to illustrate the difference in
          results obtained from overestimated distance and exact
          similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> length determination. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case
          duplicates the example given by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinga</ENAMEX>.
          Phrases from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy Cope</ENAMEX> poem were converted to
          standard and binary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> for each of the sequences. The
          pair-wise comparisons were performed using both
          approaches and the results are shown as pixel maps
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In these pixel maps, brighter regions
          indicate higher distance values and should correspond to
          symbol pairs found in similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. It is clear from
          the images in this figure that the major similar segments
          (lengths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 9</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) are clearly visible in both
          images. However, the exact distances in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> USM
          image clearly show the shorter segments (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lengths 3, 4,</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) that are somewhat hidden by the standard USM
          overestimation error (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). A similar illustration
          is provided using a sample nucleotide sequence. The
          sequence coding the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin receptor</ENAMEX> was acquired
          through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">048346</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSR</ENAMEX>) and used in a BLAST search
          for similar sequences. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M69243,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CTK-1</ENAMEX>) was taken from that list. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nucleotide segment
          of the of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">048346,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3056-3155</TIMEX>) associated with the predicted tyrosine kinase
          domain and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nucleotide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> from the chicken
          tyrosine kinase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M69243</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51-150</NUMEX>) were converted to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard USM</ENAMEX> and bUSM coordinates and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise compared
          using the associated distance metrics. Pixel maps of the
          distance metrics were prepared (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Again, the
          long similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are clearly visible in both images.
          The overestimation noise in the standard USM (image A)
          again masks many of the shorter similar segments seen in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX> (image B).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinga</ENAMEX> presented a fundamentally interesting
        and practically useful extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaos Game</ENAMEX>
        Representation iterative function (CGR) referred to as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Sequence Maps</ENAMEX> (USM) and demonstrated the
        application of this representation and an associated
        distance metric in the identification of similar segments
        of discrete sequences. In this report we have presented
        considerations for the practical implementation of these
        methods and offer an implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
        eliminates the overestimation of the length of similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">segments, 2</ENAMEX>) eliminates the inability to recognize similar
        segments longer than the word length of the coordinate
        representation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) can be implemented with more efficient
        operations, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) provides a simple conversion that
        recovers the standard USM coordinates. As currently
        defined, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> distance metric (and associated bUSM
        implementation) is limited to the estimation of lengths of
        local identity about the pair of symbols being
        compared.
        The nature of the overestimation by the unidirectional
        distance metric was revealed in a proof of the distribution
        of the overestimation from the standard method. The
        algebraic difference taken in computing the distance
        results in the overestimation of length. This observation
        leads to a modification of the algorithm that eliminates
        the interaction of symbols when computing distance. We also
        recognize, in this derivation, that to achieve this result
        we must assume that the i thcoordinates for the symbol
        representations are equally likely ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> coding
        selections for standard USM sequences must be balanced so
        as to make the occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 0</NUMEX> in a standard USM
        coordinate equally likely for the given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> set (and
        frequency of occurrence). This indicates that instead of
        choosing the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">n binary representations</ENAMEX> of symbols as
        suggested in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , the symbols should be chosen from the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> possible values in such a way as to
        balance the occurrences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 0</NUMEX> for each coordinate. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX> approach places no constraints other than
        uniqueness on the symbol representation.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX> approach eliminates the overestimation
        problem noted in the standard USM and can recover more
        symbols than the standard approach for a given amount of
        storage. The binary approach is faster than the standard
        approach (based on a straightforward implementation) and
        offers the potential for further enhancement through, for
        example, the use of processor instructions designed
        specifically to find the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or last bit set in a word
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">e.g.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pentium Bit Scan Reverse</ENAMEX> (BSR) instruction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] ).
        In our test cases the binary approach performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>
        times that of the standard approach even though it
        processed 6 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> forward, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> backward) rather than 4 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>
        forward, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> backward) coordinates. These measurements are
        specific to the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> (processor, OS, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) and with optimizations these ratios will change
        considerably.
        The computational cost of preparing the coordinates is
        insignificant when compared to the cost of the distance
        calculations in cases we examined. This may, in part, be
        due to the fact that we performed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> Ã— 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> comparisons for sequences of length
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and with a minimum value for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>. Since the storage
        requirements for a USM representation of a sequence are
        considerably larger than that of the sequence itself, it
        may be more efficient to store the sequence in its native
        form (a sequence of symbols) and compute the USM
        coordinates just prior to sequence comparison when a large
        number of comparisons are being performed. We also observed
        that the storage size of the coordinates had an impact on
        computational performance. The performance of the algorithm
        decreases sharply when the USM coordinate representation
        exceeds the on-chip cache of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processor</ENAMEX>. This may
        indicate that we should be considering tradeoffs between
        word length and the size of the similar segments we wish to
        detect without using the recursive length function. If, for
        example, the probability of sequences <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 16</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symbols</ENAMEX> is sufficiently small, then a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> bit coordinate
        might be used.
        A single pairwise comparison grows as the upper integer
        of the base <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> logarithm of the number of unique symbols.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almeida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vinga</ENAMEX> note that for a given length of interest 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> , we need to sample the distance
        metric at no more than 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
        
          A 
         Â· 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>

        w indices to locate all sequences of
        length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> or greater. In an application
        focused on locating all identical segments of length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> or greater, the computational cost
        therefore grows as [log 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
        nn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">)]Â·</ENAMEX>( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>

          B 
         )/ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> . The exact distance given in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binary</ENAMEX> approach allows us to locate, from this sampling,
        the beginning and end of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> from the
        sampled symbol indices and the forward and reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. Subtracting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> less than the exact forward
        distance from the indices of the symbols being compared and
        adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> less than the exact backward distance from the
        indices we can identify the start and end of the similar
        segment containing the given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol pair</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean USM</ENAMEX>,
        offers this advantage due to its unique ability to
        determine the exact length of the similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        USM representations of discrete sequences in genomics
        and proteomics offer the possibility of scale-independent
        representations of sequence information surrounding points
        of comparison in those sequences. In order to maximize the
        potential for application of these methods we must consider
        both their theoretical properties and the computational
        methods for efficient implementation that retain these
        properties. We have offered one further step in that
        direction by identifying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> implementation of USM
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">bUSM</NUMEX>) that not only preserves the theoretical properties
        of numerical USM but actually uses the binary environment
        of the computational implementation to achieve a more exact
        logical solution. The proposed implementation leads to a
        distance metric that exactly determines similarity length
        between sequences. Ultimately, this achievement can be
        described as one that replaces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
        logarithmic, numerical distance, with computationally more
        efficient logic operations. It could then be argued that,
        given the discrete nature of biological sequences, new
        scale-independent numerical representations, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX>,
        are all but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the identification of more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accurate Boolean</ENAMEX> equivalents of fundamental relevance.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Software implementation
          Test versions of both the standard USM and the Boolean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> algorithms were developed in order to facilitate
          performance comparisons of practical implementations. A
          single "generic" implementation of the framework for both
          methods was first developed and then used as the starting
          point for developing method-specific implementations.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> was taken so as to minimize differences in any code
          other than that implementing the recursion and the
          distance metric calculations. Programs were written in C
          and compiled and tested in the same environment
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX>, linker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>) and executed
          against the same test cases. No attempt was made to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimize</ENAMEX> either implementation (beyond that performed by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX>). Both applications were compiled using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compiler</ENAMEX> (gcc version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.95.3</NUMEX>) under the cygwin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">environment http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cygwin</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/</ENAMEX>on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GHz</ENAMEX> Pentium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> running Windows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> code,
          Makefiles, and test data are available from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://bioinformatics.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">musc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu/resources</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Software performance testing
          Test cases were produced by replicating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 kbp</TIMEX> segments of the e-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli genome</ENAMEX> to create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> kbp, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          kbp, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> kbp, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> kbp, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> kbp, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> kbp, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> kbp, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kbp, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          kbp sequences. Each implementation is run as a separate
          program. The programs load the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequences to be
          compared from disk, compute the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USM</ENAMEX> (or bUSM) coordinates
          for all symbols in each sequence, and compute the local
          distance metric ( or ) for all pairs of symbols. Compute
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> was measured from the point following the load of
          the sequence from disk to the point at which all of the
          distance calculations were completed. Times were measured
          using the unix clock() function. Compute time was also
          measured from the point at which the USM coordinate
          calculations were completed to the end of the distance
          calculations.
