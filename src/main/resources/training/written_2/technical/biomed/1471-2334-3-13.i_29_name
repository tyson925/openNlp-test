          Testing the hypothesis
          We can test this hypothesis by:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Identifying genes likely to have been transferred
          (directly or indirectly) to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:H7 from archaea.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) Investigating the distribution of similar genes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX> and non-pathogens and performing rigorous
          phylogenetic analyses on putative transfers.
        
        
          Have any transfers been described between archaea
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coliO157</ENAMEX>?
          I have demonstrated that a gene coding for a
          bifunctional catalase-peroxidase is likely a transfer
          from archaea to a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogenic bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H7</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Although
          not yet directly implicated in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">O157:H7</TIMEX> as a virulence
          factor, this enzyme has been implicated as a virulence
          factor in 
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 26</NUMEX>
          ] , and in 
          Legionella pneumophila [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          Furthermore, this 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H7</NUMEX> catalase-peroxidase
          has been associated with enterohaemorrhagic hemolysin in
          a variety of shiga-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>-producing
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">verotoxin</NUMEX>-producing) 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . This
          correlation of the presence of the catalase-peroxidase in
          many virulent but not in avirulent strains suggests a
          direct role in the virulence of enterohemorrhagic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> .
        
        
          How can we identify other genes likely to have been
          transferred (directly or indirectly) to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coliO157</ENAMEX>:H7
          from archaea?
          We can use the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> complete 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genomes</ENAMEX> available [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 20 21</NUMEX>
          ] to identify a subset of genes present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (or both)
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">O157</NUMEX> strains but not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>. This subset of genes
          - although most have not been directly identified as
          virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> - are more likely to be
          virulence-associated. This subset will be the focus of
          our search for genes likely to have laterally transferred
          from archaea. Perna 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,387</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the EDL933 O157</TIMEX> strain they sequenced that are
          O157-specific; This number does not include the
          O157-specific plasmids that were previously sequenced [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] from which some of the preliminary work [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
          described below was derived.
          As a preliminary step to testing this hypothesis I
          have searched the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli O157</ENAMEX>:H7 strain EDL933 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
          genome for open reading frames (ORFs) meeting the
          following criteria:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">O157</TIMEX> strain EDL933 but not in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) highly similar (having a BLASTP similarity bit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">score > 95</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> archaeal
          genomes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) having few or no highly similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (BLASTP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">score < 85</ENAMEX>) in other bacterial genomes
          This search was facilitated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clusters of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orthologous Groups</ENAMEX> (COG) database at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] .
          This preliminary, non-systematic search produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ORFS
          worth considering as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGTs</ENAMEX> from archaea to pathogenic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Table 1shows these ORFs with their location
          and, if any information was available, a possible
          function.
          Although the putative functions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1are</ENAMEX> not
          generally associated with virulence, many genes, under
          the right circumstances, can facilitate infection or
          contribute to pathogenicity. There are examples in the
          literature where both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> transporters (in 
          Streptococcus gordonii : [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] )
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helicase genes</ENAMEX> (in 
          Legionella pneumophila : [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] )
          have been directly implicated in virulence.
          Further testing of this hypothesis will require
          rigorous phylogenetic analyses of each suspected
          transfer. The procedure of comparing similarity scores to
          identify potential lateral transfers (used above)
          although commonly employed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 37</NUMEX> ] it is fraught with
          potential errors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 38 39 40 41 42 34 35</NUMEX> ] and must
          serve only as an initial screen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ragan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] recently
          wrote:
          
            This study demonstrates the need for
            a systematic, comprehensive approach to the study of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LGT</ENAMEX> based on first principles, i.e. rigorous inference
            and statistically based comparison of molecular
            phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. As more genomic sequences appear, a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-based approach will become both more challenging
            and more rewarding. 
          
        
        
          Implications of the hypothesis
          Although this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> focuses on archaea and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , the model of distant gene
          transfer as a major contributor of "new" virulence genes
          to pathogens or potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathogens</ENAMEX> has broad
          applicability to a large number of pathogenic systems.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> represent both the most distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and, in
          many ways, the most unlikely source for virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          If 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> can acquire virulence genes
          from archaea, then potentially any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is a
          reservoir of virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for pathogens. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ]
          The implications, should this hypothesis be proven,
          are myriad. Our understanding of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
          virulence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be expanded to include virtually all
          life on earth - at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance a frightening prospect.
          At the same time, however, it would allow us to move from
          a descriptive, reactionary view of infectious disease
          towards a predictive science of infectious disease. It
          would be dramatic evidence of what some microbiologists
          suspect: that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer is the predominant
          engine of variation in prokaryotes and the catalyst for
          the emergence of new bacterial pathogens.
