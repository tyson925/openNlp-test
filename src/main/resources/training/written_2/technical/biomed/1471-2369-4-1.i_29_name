        Atrial fibrillation is thought to be more common in
        chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
        although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> based comparisons are not available. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atrial</ENAMEX> fibrillation is worthy of separate study from
        other dysrythmias due to unique aspects of its natural
        history and management. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] Risk factors for atrial
        fibrillation may be more common in dialysis, and include
        age, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac enlargement</ENAMEX> and an abnormal
        calcium-phosphorous metabolism. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] However, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX>, risk factors and associated mortality for
        hospitalized atrial fibrillation have not been reported for
        a national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies have also not assessed the effects of
        cardioprotective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> on atrial fibrillation in
        dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of chronic dialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atrial fibrillation is controversial, since
        studies of atrial fibrillation have generally excluded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] We therefore
        performed an historical cohort study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renal Data System</ENAMEX> (USRDS) <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality</ENAMEX>
        Study (DMMS) Wave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, which includes information on blood
        pressure, lipid levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, and other important
        clinical data. Our objectives were to determine the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX>, and risk factors for hospitalized atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> (primary hospitalization discharge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ICD9</TIMEX> code
        427.31.x), occurring after the initiation of dialysis but
        prior to receipt of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal transplantation</ENAMEX>, as well as
        determine risk factors for mortality after hospitalized
        atrial fibrillation.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Statistical analysis
          Univariate analysis was performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-Square</ENAMEX>
          testing for categorical variables (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX> exact test used
          for violations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cochran</ENAMEX>'s assumptions) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test for continuous variables (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann Whitney test</ENAMEX> was
          used for variables without a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution).
          Variables with borderline significance (p value < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          in univariate analysis) and those thought likely to have
          a clinical relationship with atrial fibrillation, such as
          cardioprotective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> and blood pressure, were
          entered into the multivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. In addition,
          variables thought to have a likely clinical relationship
          with atrial fibrillation were also entered into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multivariate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, in accordance with established
          epidemiological principles. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stepwise</ENAMEX> (forward
          likelihood ratio method) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards
          analysis was used to assess the association between
          baseline factors and hospitalized atrial fibrillation,
          independent of other factors. Log-log plots were
          inspected to verify the existence of proportional
          hazards. Estimated hazard ratios (HR) along with
          corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals (CI) and p values
          are reported for all regression covariates. Stepwise
          logistic regression was used to test the independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of patient factors with preexisting coumadin
          and cardioselective beta-blocker use, using the same
          covariates as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Regression</ENAMEX> above. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          atrial fibrillation with mortality as a time-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> was tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> non-proportional hazards
          regression analysis as previously described. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
          Hierarchically <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">well-formed models</ENAMEX> were used in the
          assessment of interaction terms. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] Collinearity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostics</ENAMEX> were evaluated both from the output of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> procedures and by manual generation of models
          including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of several variables with close
          relationships (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX> and
          left ventricular hypertrophy, which was assessed by chest
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X-ray</ENAMEX>, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography).
          Propensity scores [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] have been used to adjust for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounding</ENAMEX> in baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use. Since this method
          is primarily undertaken to assess uniformity of risk
          among strata, model fitting was also tested by fitting
          models to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> random sample of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
          and then running the same model for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to test for agreement.
        
      
      
        Results
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4065</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMMS Wave</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 cohort.</TIMEX> Of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these, 3621</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had valid dates for
        starting dialysis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. From this cohort, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3374</TIMEX> had
        sufficient information to calculate follow-up times. During
        the time of the study period, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        hospitalized for a primary discharge diagnosis of atrial
        fibrillation, with an incidence density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5/1000</NUMEX> person
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        Use of digoxin and particularly levothyroxine was common
        in dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Among other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-arrhythmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>,
        only amiodarone was used by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baseline</ENAMEX>, and so is the only other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> reported. Among
        the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, cardioselective beta-blockers were
        used by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.6%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized for atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.4%</NUMEX> of all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; digoxin was
        used by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized for atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8%</NUMEX> of all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; and coumadin
        was used by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized for atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.6%</NUMEX> of all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Characteristics of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, including
        univariate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with hospitalized atrial
        fibrillation, are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the
        percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were hospitalized for atrial
        fibrillation by risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. As shown, there were marked
        disparities by age, blood pressure, dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modality</ENAMEX>, and
        history of left ventricular hypertrophy.
        Table 3shows significant factors associated with
        hospitalized atrial fibrillation in multivariate analysis
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Regression</ENAMEX>. Factors positively associated with
        atrial fibrillation were advanced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">></ENAMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71 years</TIMEX> vs.
        age <<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48 years</TIMEX>), hemodialysis (vs. peritoneal dialysis),
        and baseline digoxin use. Pre-dialysis systolic blood
        pressure had a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>" shaped association with atrial
        fibrillation, with highest risk associated with the low and
        high extremes of blood pressure (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However,
        neither pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure nor
        post-dialysis blood pressure were associated with the risk
        of atrial fibrillation, nor were serum albumin levels. No
        medications except digoxin were independently associated
        with atrial fibrillation. There were also no significant
        interactions between terms, specifically between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medications</ENAMEX>, laboratory data or dialysis modality in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preexisting coronary heart disease</ENAMEX>.
        There were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> total deaths in the cohort through <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2000</TIMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized for atrial
        fibrillation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> died during the study period. Mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follow-up</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.92</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.14 years</TIMEX>. Unadjusted survival after
        atrial fibrillation and for the entire cohort is also shown
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. Survival was significantly worse after atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> non-proportional hazards regression
        analysis, adjusted hazard ratio for mortality, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.54</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
        confidence interval, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.19</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.99</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>. The leading
        cause of death among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized for atrial
        fibrillation was unknown (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>), followed by cardiac arrest
        of unknown cause (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac arrthymia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX>), acute
        myocardial infarction (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>), atherosclerotic heart disease
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>), cardiomyopathy (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>). Of patients
        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation, the most common
        secondary diagnosis was hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>),
        followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>).
        Table 5shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Regression</ENAMEX> analysis of factors
        significantly associated with mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        hospitalized atrial fibrillation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> factors, the
        baseline use of coumadin (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and higher systolic
        blood pressure, were associated with a lower risk of
        mortality after hospitalization for atrial fibrillation. Of
        note, calcium channel blockers, specifically
        non-dihyropyridine calcium channel blockers, were not
        significantly associated with mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        atrial fibrillation. In fact, the hazard ratio for
        mortality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atrial fibrillation using
        non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.85</NUMEX>,
        although the p value was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.21 and 95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals
        were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.69</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.94</NUMEX>. Dihydropyridine calcium blockers, as well
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE inhibitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, were also not significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX>. Because use of coumadin might be biased by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with factors favorably associated with
        mortality, logistic regression analysis was performed to
        assess factors independently associated with use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coumadin</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> factors were independently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the use of coumadin: left ventricular
        hypertrophy on echocardiography (adjusted odds ratio, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.88</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.10</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.20</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>); chronic obstructive lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (adjusted odds ratio, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.98</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.05</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.74</NUMEX>); and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> use (adjusted odds ratio, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> regression analysis was performed
        limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had left ventricular hypertrophy,
        chronic obstructive lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, or did not use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
        hospitalized for atrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibrillation</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX>), coumadin use
        was still significantly associated with improved survival,
        adjusted hazard ratio, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.36</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.16</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.82</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.014</NUMEX>.
        Models were robust to testing on random samples of the
        study population (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the remaining 30%</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        In agreement with some previous studies in the general
        population [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4</NUMEX>] and preliminary reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USRDS</ENAMEX>, [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] atrial fibrillation was associated with increased
        mortality among chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, cardiovascular events, and not thromboembolic
        events, are the most common cause of death after atrial
        fibrillation, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] in agreement with the findings of the
        present analysis. However, it is also possible that
        thromboembolic events could have been underdiagnosed due to
        a low index of suspicion for thromboembolism in chronic
        dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] because of the high number
        of deaths with an unknown cause, the low rate of autopsies
        in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, or a combination of these factors.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vazquez et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] provide further evidence that causes of
        death may underestimate the incidence of embolic events in
        chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atrial fibrillation. They
        reported that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> of chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> suffered thromboembolic events at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">followup</ENAMEX>.
        Risk factors for atrial fibrillation in chronic dialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were consistent with established risk factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 27</NUMEX> ] , except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with hemodialysis
        (compared with those on peritoneal dialysis). In addition
        to age, left ventricular hypertrophy is also a
        well-established risk factor for atrial fibrillation in the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> for cardiovascular
        comorbidity were associated with atrial fibrillation in
        univariate analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), but not in multivariate
        analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). While the efficacy of cardioversion in
        successful conversion of atrial dysrythmias may be helpful
        in some settings, it is less useful than the duration of
        the dysrythmia in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atrial fibrillation. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        However, it has never been established whether the same
        guidelines apply to dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The present study
        could not assess whether cardiac enlargement affected the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> rate of cardioversion in dialysis patients
        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation.
        Pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure exhibited a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>"
        shaped relationship with the risk of atrial fibrillation,
        which is similar to the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>" shaped relationship of blood
        pressure with mortality and other cardiovascular events in
        chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Recent reports have indicated
        that pulse pressure is a more predictive indicator of
        cardiovascular events in dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> or diastolic blood pressure separately. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        However, pulse pressure was not independently associated
        with atrial fibrillation in our analysis.
        Hemodialysis was associated with a significantly higher
        risk of atrial fibrillation than peritoneal dialysis in the
        present study. It is possible this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> represents
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>, since hemodialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> present for medical care
        much more frequently than peritoneal dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and
        asymptomatic atrial fibrillation is more readily detected.
        However, there are legitimate reasons why atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> might occur more frequently on hemodialysis
        than on peritoneal dialysis. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foley et al</ENAMEX>
        demonstrated that progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac enlargement</ENAMEX> was more
        frequent in hemodialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than peritoneal dialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] although these findings were not replicated
        in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> study. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have
        confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LVH</ENAMEX> progresses despite adequate blood
        pressure control in hemodialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] Also,
        hospitalized congestive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> is more common in
        hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, especially
        for those on the renal transplant waiting list. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] The
        typical regimen for hemodialysis is likely far less
        physiologic than peritoneal dialysis. Residual renal
        function may also be preserved longer in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on
        peritoneal dialysis, although this is controversial. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] Some or all of these factors may therefore mediate the
        higher risk of atrial fibrillation associated with

        The effectiveness of coumadin for atrial fibrillation in
        chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> has not been assessed previously.
        In fact, previous reports considered chronic renal failure
        a contraindication to the use of anticoagulation in atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiesholzer et al</ENAMEX> concluded that
        non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation was not an independent
        risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
        Therefore, Figure 2suggests several possibilities. First,
        although the clinical indications for coumadin use in this
        cohort were unknown, coumadin is often given for a limited
        period of time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , after which it is often
        discontinued, in the absence of known predisposing factors.
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were using coumadin at the time of
        the study assessment and later discontinued it might not
        have been taking coumadin at the time they were
        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation, negating a possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of coumadin with mortality after
        hospitalization for atrial fibrillation. Another
        possibility is that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> not taking coumadin at
        baseline may have later been treated with coumadin after
        hospitalization for atrial fibrillation. Given the growing
        evidence that dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the modern era may
        actually be hypercoagulable, primarily due to defects of
        the fibrinolytic system, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 37 38</NUMEX> ] clinical trials of
        the use of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thromboembolic disorders</ENAMEX> are warranted. Of note, baseline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coumadin</ENAMEX> use, in contrast to digoxin use, was not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with hospitalization for atrial fibrillation and
        therefore presumably was not a marker for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        pre-existing atrial fibrillation.
        The decision to use coumadin in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> in whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSR</ENAMEX> cannot be established is based on
        an assessment of both their risk of serious bleeding and
        their risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. Coumadin therapy has been associated
        with improved survival in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> systolic
        dysfunction in the absence of dysrythmias as well,
        primarily through reduction in cardiovascular events rather
        than reduction of thromboembolic events. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] This may be
        one explanation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of coumadin use with
        reduced mortality in chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized
        for atrial fibrillation in the present study.
      
      
        Study limitations
        The present study was observational and not randomized,
        and therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> should not be construed as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causative</ENAMEX>. The study is a random sample of all hemodialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, not the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, although the peritoneal
        dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was almost fully captured. We did not
        have access to information on treatment or conversion to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were hospitalized for atrial
        fibrillation, nor did we have information on the type of
        atrial fibrillation for which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presented and how it
        was classified within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACC/AHA/ESC</ENAMEX> guidelines. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] We did
        not have access to information on which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        self-limited episodes of atrial fibrillation vs. those who
        had persistent atrial fibrillation, nor the duration or
        presence of atrial fibrillation prior to hospitalization or
        the study start. We did not have information on left atrial
        size other than the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LVH</ENAMEX> on echocardiography. We
        also did not have information on thyroid functions (other
        than baseline use of thyroxine), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use, or
        pre-existing atrial dysrythmias. Information bias could
        have arisen due to mistakes in coding or spelling,
        especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. We were unable to follow
        changes in variables over time. Therefore, we could not
        follow changes in blood pressure, laboratory values,
        dialysis adequacy, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>. We could not assess
        other factors that have shown to be associated with atrial
        fibrillation, such as hypokalemia or calcified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aortic/mitral</ENAMEX> valves, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] although there are many
        similarities between the risk factors for valvular heart
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and atrial fibrillation in chronic dialysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] Our use of atrial fibrillation as an
        outcome variable required survival to reach
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX>, and thus sudden death was not considered
        as an outcome. However, causes of death, especially if not
        verified by autopsy, are also of questionable validity in
        comparison to the rates of total mortality. [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]
        In summary, the present observational, non-randomized
        study confirms the high incidence and mortality of atrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrillation</ENAMEX> in chronic dialysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Traditional risk
        factors for atrial fibrillation such, as older age, were
        confirmed. Hemodialysis, possibly due to a greater
        frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">progressive cardiac enlargement</ENAMEX> or more
        frequent observation, was also identified as a risk factor
        for atrial fibrillation. Of the greatest potential
        importance, the use of coumadin at the start of the study
        was associated with lower mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> later
        hospitalized for atrial fibrillation. These findings should
        be confirmed in clinical trials.
