        α-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Actinin</ENAMEX> is an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein
        present in a variety of cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and in focal adhesion
        sites where cells adhere to the substrate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . There is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and histologic [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] evidence that focal
        adhesion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, containing α-actinin and other footpad
        material, are left behind as a result of normal movement of
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , perhaps at increased rates when neutrophils
        and monocytes move into inflammatory tissue. We have shown
        that α-actinin is abundant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> stroma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>, presumably at focal adhesion sites [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . We have
        also reported that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> kDa amino-terminal α-actinin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX>, which we have named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mactinin</ENAMEX>, is generated by the
        degradation of extracellular α-actinin by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monocyte-</ENAMEX>secreted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urokinase</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, we have demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> is present in inflammation caused by 
        Pneumocystis <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carinii pneumonia</ENAMEX>, by
        examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
        infection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . It was not present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> not challenged
        with 
        P. carinii , suggesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inflammaton</ENAMEX> is necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mactinin</ENAMEX> formation. We have
        also reported that mactinin promotes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">monocyte</ENAMEX>/macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . For example, α-actinin fragments
        significantly increase lysozyme secretion and
        tartate-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid phosphatase staining</ENAMEX> in peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX>. In contrast, intact α-actinin has no
        maturation-promoting activity. We proposed that mactinin is
        present in the microenvironment at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of various types
        of inflammation, perhaps owing to migrating cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, and there it might contribute to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX> and maturation of monocytes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Monocyte/macrophage</ENAMEX> infiltration has a key role in the
        pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The release of
        pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and
        enzymes by the synovial lining macrophages is important for
        the onset, propagation, and flare of arthritic inflammation
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The finding that the number of synovial tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> is correlated with joint destruction in
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> is evidence of their importance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monocytes</ENAMEX> and macrophages are believed to have a
        similar role in other chronic inflammatory joint diseases,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gout</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and psoriatic arthropathy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Therefore in this study we assessed the effects of mactinin
        on monocyte chemotaxis 
        in vitro . We have also tested
        synovial fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with various types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, including rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, psoriatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">reactive arthritis</ENAMEX>, gout, and ankylosing
        spondylitis, for the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monocyte</ENAMEX>/macrophage
        maturation-promoting fragment, mactinin. We have also
        investigated whether mactinin is present in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> model in rabbits [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        Macrophages are believed to be important in this model of
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] , and both the arthritic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> joint fluid can be tested for mactinin.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Source of mactinin
          As described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pGEX2</NUMEX> vector,
          encoding the actin-binding domain, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues 2</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">269</NUMEX> of
          chicken smooth muscle α-actinin, fused with the carboxy
          terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) with an
          engineered thrombin cleavage site, was kindly provided by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dr DR Critchley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Leicester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>.
          Fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was expressed in 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> , and the cleavage
          products of the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were purified by affinity
          chromatography of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> extracts on immobilized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutathione</ENAMEX>. The fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was then cleaved with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calbiochem</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA) to yield the
          actin-binding domain of α-actinin and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>.
          The cleavage products were then separated by
          reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a
          C-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> column [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE demonstrated that the
          α-actinin fragment was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> of the total protein
          of pooled fractions, with the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> being carrier
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX>. The calculated molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of this α-actinin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da</ENAMEX>. In this report, both the active
          product of urokinase degradation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-actinin</NUMEX> formed 
          in vivo [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and the active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> actin-binding domain, which are of similar
          molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX>, will be referred to as mactinin.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mactinin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> routinely assay negative for protein
          endotoxin with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrotell</ENAMEX> chromogenic assay kit, which
          can detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 0.25</NUMEX> endotoxin units/ml (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associates</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Cod</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Woods Hole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Isolation of peripheral blood monocytes
          Mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coat
          preparations of healthy blood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> by density gradient
          centrifugation with Histopaque <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1077</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contaminating</ENAMEX> red cells were then lysed in distilled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and the sample was applied to an LS separation
          column with a magnetic monocyte isolation kit in
          accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions (Miltenyi
          Biotec, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Auburn</ENAMEX>, CA). This negative selection method
          resulted in a cell population containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX>
          monocytes as determined by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD14</TIMEX> expression.
        
        
          Chemotaxis assay
          Cell migration was assessed by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro-chemotaxis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NeuroProbe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>).
          An aliquot of peptide was placed in the lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>, and a suspension of monocytes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</NUMEX>) was placed in the upper compartment of
          the well. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX> were separated by a
          polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with a
          pore size of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μm</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the incubation period</TIMEX> the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> was removed, fixed, and stained with a Hema 3
          stain set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). The cells that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migrated</ENAMEX> through the membrane pore in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> high-power
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fields (×400</ENAMEX>) were counted by light microscopy. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> membranes were counted for each
          concentration.
        
        
          Assessment of mactinin concentrations necessary for
          HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> maturation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> myeloid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> cells were seeded at a density
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5/ml</ENAMEX> and grown for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">μg/ml</ENAMEX> gentamicin and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> fetal calf serum at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , in the presence of various
          concentrations of recombinant mactinin. We have
          previously reported that mactinin promotes monocyte
          maturation as measured by morphology, non-specific
          esterase activity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rosette</ENAMEX> formation in this
          leukemia cell line [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Here we report the
          concentrations necessary to induce maturation as measured
          by non-specific esterase staining used as a maturation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Antisera generation
          To generate antisera with sensitivity for detecting
          mactinin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified recombinant chicken</ENAMEX> α-actinin peptide
          was modified by coupling with dinitrophenol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and
          injected into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">white rabbits</ENAMEX> along with
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund</ENAMEX>'s adjuvant, as described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
          . Boosts were done with peptide and incomplete <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjuvant</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> studies were approved by the
          Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animal Care</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Use Committee</ENAMEX> (IACUC) of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Affairs Medical Center</ENAMEX>. Antisera
          were screened for their ability to detect the immunizing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> and were immunoaffinity-purified with columns of
          the recombinant fragment covalently bound to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Affi</ENAMEX>-Gel
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 matrix</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA). We expected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity of the purified antisera with fragments
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> because of the highly
          conserved amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Synovial fluid samples
          Fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> undergoing
          therapeutic arthrocentesis was collected and tested for
          the presence of the fragment by Western blot analysis.
          The use of these fluid samples in this study was approved
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittee</ENAMEX> on human studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAMC</ENAMEX>. In brief, fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">895</NUMEX> 
          g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> and frozen at
          -80°C until the time of analysis. Because mactinin is a
          very small fraction of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content (more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 μg/10 μl</NUMEX>) of the fluid, immunoaffinity
          purification of mactinin was performed before Western
          blotting. Samples were thawed, dialyzed against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX>-buffered saline, and centrifuged again; the
          total sample volume was then applied to a column of
          immunoaffinity-purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> covalently bound to a
          Affi-Gel 15 matrix, and eluted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sodium citrate
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M NaCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fractions</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 ml</NUMEX>) were collected
          and neutralized with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 M Tris-HCl</ENAMEX>. Protein-containing
          fractions were pooled, dialyzed against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX>-buffered saline, concentrated, and subjected to
          electrophoresis on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gel under reducing
          conditions. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 μl</NUMEX>, representing
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> of the total sample.
        
        
          Immunoblot analysis
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> separated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE were transferred
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoretically</ENAMEX> to poly(vinylidene difluoride)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>). The membrane was blocked with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfat milk</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M Tris-HCl/150 M NaCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequentially</ENAMEX> treated with affinity-purified rabbit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisera</ENAMEX> raised against recombinant mactinin, followed by
          second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> conjugated with alkaline phosphatase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Mesa</ENAMEX>, CA). Immunoreactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          detected by alkaline phosphatase reaction with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate/nitroblue</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetrazolium</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> analyses were performed with rabbit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz Biochemistry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Dissociation of immune <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in rheumatoid
          arthritis fluid
          To examine whether mactinin was present in immune
          complexes in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> fluid, some samples
          were acidified by dialysis against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sodium acetate,
          pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX>, to dissociate complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The acidified
          samples were first fractionated on an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-75</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>) size-exclusion
          column. Fractions identified by Western blotting as
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mactinin</ENAMEX> were pooled, neutralized, and further
          purified by fractionation on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-4</ENAMEX> column. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-4</ENAMEX> column
          was equilibrated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> trifluoroacetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and
          eluted with an acetonitrile gradient (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>) run at
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ml</ENAMEX>/min. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aliquots</ENAMEX> of protein-containing fractions were
          used for Western blots.
        
        
          Measurement of mactinin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> model
          To produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>
          white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbits</ENAMEX> were immunized by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subdermal</ENAMEX> injection of
          ovalbumin emulsified in complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund</ENAMEX>'s adjuvant in
          accordance with modifications [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] of the method of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dumonde</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glynn</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IACUC</ENAMEX> approval. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with positive skin tests to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovalbumin</ENAMEX> received intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">articular</ENAMEX> injections of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mg of
          sterile ovalbumin into one knee and an equal volume of
          sterile saline in the contralateral control knee weekly
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthritic</ENAMEX> and control knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> were then
          lavaged with saline and aspirated at the time of killing,
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had developed chronic synovitis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 weeks</TIMEX>
          after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intraarticular</ENAMEX> injections were complete.
          Samples were frozen at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80°C</TIMEX> until the time of analysis.
          Samples were then concentrated and used for Western

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mactinin</ENAMEX> is a chemoattractant for peripheral blood
          monocytes
          For analysis of the effect of mactinin on monocyte
          chemotaxis, peripheral blood monocytes were placed in the
          upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-well micro-chamber plate with
          various concentrations of mactinin. The lower compartment
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> also contained various concentrations of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> and was separated from the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> by a
          polycarbonate filter. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-10</ENAMEX> nM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> had significant chemotactic activity for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX>. Intact α-actinin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> had no activity.
          Because our mactinin preparations were contaminated with
          up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> (thus containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX>), we tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> alone and also found no
          activity. The number of concentrations tested per assay
          was limited by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> combinations for
          triplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>), but in separate assays we have seen
          significant chemotactic activity at mactinin
          concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 0.5</NUMEX> nM. The concentration of
          mactinin necessary for activity is similar to that of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMLP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM) in our assay system, and mactinin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMLP</ENAMEX> attract similar numbers of monocytes.
        
        
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mactinin</ENAMEX>'s maturation-promoting

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> mactinin has maturation-promoting activity
          
          in vitro in HL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">leukemia cells</ENAMEX> at
          the concentrations shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. That is, it induces
          non-specific esterase staining at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> pM and activity
          reaches a plateau at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 pM</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> controls were
          run at a similar range of concentrations and showed no
          significant activity.
        
        
          Detection of mactinin in arthritis fluid
          Affinity-purified rabbit antiserum raised against a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant chicken</ENAMEX> α-actinin fragment detected picogram
          amounts of the immunizing amino-terminal protein fragment
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). As also shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, this antiserum
          reacted with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of the expected molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> in
          representative samples of immunoaffinity-purified
          synovial fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">psoriatic arthritis</ENAMEX>,
          reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, gout, and ankylosing spondylitis. In
          all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with these
          arthritides contained mactinin. In contrast, mactinin was
          detected in none of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rheumatoid arthritis samples</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test).
          When the detected levels of mactinin are corrected for
          the recovery rate by the isolation procedure, they are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml, and are in the range of
          maturation-promoting activity 
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vitro (≥ 25</ENAMEX> pM or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml) and
          the level needed for chemotactic activity (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 nM</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX>). The lack of mactinin in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
          fluid was surprising, and we decided to pursue this
          further.
          Owing to the autoimmune nature of rheumatoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, we examined whether mactinin was present in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. That is, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-bound mactinin might
          not bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-matrix column used in the
          isolation protocol to decrease the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> load,
          resulting in mactinin being undetectable but potentially
          active. To dissociate immune <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, an aliquot of a
          rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> fluid sample was acidified and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were fractionated on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-4</ENAMEX> column. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, mactinin is detectable by Western blot analysis
          after dissociation from immune <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          To confirm the presence of mactinin in rheumatoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arthritis fluids</ENAMEX>, some frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aliquots</ENAMEX> were thawed and
          immediately subjected to electrophoresis on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, affinity-purified mactinin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisera</ENAMEX> reacted
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several 30-40</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> kDa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> in each of the samples tested. We have
          previously demonstrated that only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> kDa α-actinin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">degradation</ENAMEX> product has maturation-promoting activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were not seen in non-reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>,
          which did have immunoreactive material at the top of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gel</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Hence, the detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> might
          represent mactinin bound to various immune complex
          fragments.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mactinin</ENAMEX> is present in inflammatory fluid from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">antigen-induced arthritis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthritic</ENAMEX> and control knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of rabbits with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chronic antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> were lavaged with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> and aspirated at the time of killing. Samples were
          concentrated and used for Western blots run under
          reducing conditions. As seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, mactinin is
          present in arthritis joint fluid but absent from control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluid</ENAMEX>, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mactinin</ENAMEX> formation is dependent on
          the inflammatory response. As also seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>,
          another α-actinin fragment of slightly higher molecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX> is present in both samples.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        During inflammatory processes, various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, such
        as cytokines and chemokines, regulate the recruitment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX>. Once in the tissue, monocytes undergo the poorly
        understood process of transformation to macrophages with
        altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphology</ENAMEX> and function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>,
        synovial macrophages might cause joint destruction by
        differentiating to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone-resorbing osteoclasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] or by
        releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage-degrading enzymes</ENAMEX> and cytokines, such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interleukin-1</ENAMEX> and tumor necrosis factor-α [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . It has
        therefore been suggested that therapies for chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> should be aimed at depleting joint mononuclear
        cells or controlling the activation of synovial macrophages
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Indeed, elimination of macrophages by
        clodronate-laden liposomes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> models of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adjuvant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] induces amelioration
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
        Of the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of inflammation, mactinin is the
        first example of a fragment of a cytoskeletal component
        that might be released during leukocyte influx into
        inflammatory tissue. Further, mactinin might have a role in
        promoting the response of mononuclear phagocytes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. The monocyte functional studies 
        in vitro demonstrate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> nM
        levels of the fragment have significant chemotactic
        activity. We have previously reported that mactinin
        promotes monocyte maturation, as measured by lysozyme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> and tartrate-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid phosphatase</ENAMEX> staining
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Here we show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> pM levels of mactinin promote
        monocytic maturation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HL-60</ENAMEX> leukemia cell line.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mactinin</ENAMEX> is present at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of various types of
        arthritic inflammation at levels that are active 
        in vitro , including synovial fluid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">psoriatic arthritis</ENAMEX>, reactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, gout, and ankylosing spondylitis. Although it
        was not initially detected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> immunoaffinity-purified
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, it was detected after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid dissociation</ENAMEX> of immune <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senecal</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] have reported that sera from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with autoimmune
        diseases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> contain antibodies
        against microfilament-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including
        α-actinin. In addition, auto-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against actin,
        vinculin, integrins, or fibronectin could also form
        complexes with mactinin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Our results suggest
        that mactinin is bound to immune <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> joint fluid, which prevents its binding to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody-matrix</ENAMEX> during the isolation procedure. The finding
        that mactinin is detected by Western blotting of samples
        run under reducing conditions without immunoaffinity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> seems to confirm this. It is noteworthy that,
        unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is neutralizing, even antibody-bound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> might still be active.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> model of rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> in rabbits demonstrates persistent active
        inflammation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> after the intra-articular
        injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, including hypertrophy and hyperplasia
        of the synovial lining cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pannus</ENAMEX> formation with
        articular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> erosion, and chronic infiltration of
        synovium by lymphocytes and plasma cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dijkstra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] found macrophages
        in the superficial layer of the synovium, where they might
        secrete enzymes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen radicals</ENAMEX> into the joint space,
        which can lead to cartilage erosion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The protein
        levels in lavage fluid from arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> in this model
        are low enough to allow direct testing by Western blot
        analysis without immunoaffinity purification, as was needed
        with the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirates</ENAMEX>. Mactinin was found in the lavage
        fluid from arthritic knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of rabbits with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune arthritis</ENAMEX> and might contribute to macrophage
        function in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> model.
        Because this study was done using waste fluid from
        therapeutic synovial fluid aspirates, we did not have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from noninflamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>. The low mactinin recovery
        rate during the purification process and the low
        concentration of mactinin needed for activity make it
        necessary to assay at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of fluid, and this amount
        is not available from any tissue and fluid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. However,
        mactinin was not present in the control joint fluid in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> model, suggesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> is specific for the inflammation process.
        Similarly, we have reported that bronchoalveolar lavage
        fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uninfected mice</ENAMEX> contains no mactinin, in
        contrast to fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> infected with 
        P. carinii [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        The plasminogen activators, tissue type and urokinase
        type, have been reported to be both deleterious in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>, owing to the proteolysis of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        and beneficial because of fibrinolytic activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        The presence of both increased urokinase and plasmin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> synovial tissue suggests
        a complex role for urokinase in this disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ]
        that seems pertinent to our finding of urokinase-generated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> fluid samples. The overall effect
        of urokinase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> model seems
        to be beneficial, because chronic joint inflammation and
        bone erosion are significantly worse in urokinase-deficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . However, the ability of urokinase-generated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mactinin</ENAMEX> to enhance proteolysis might be deleterious.
        Hence, future testing of specific mactinin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> in
        animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> seems warranted.
      
      
        Conclusion
        We conclude that mactinin is present in arthritic
        synovial fluid in levels that can promote mononuclear
        phagocyte chemotaxis and maturation. There, increased
        numbers of mature monocytes might increase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and
        bone destruction. These results lead us to speculate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of mactinin might be of benefit in the treatment
        of some forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic arthritis</ENAMEX> and form the basis for
        our plans to test the efficacy of mactinin antisera to
        ameliorate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
