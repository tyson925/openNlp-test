        Vacuolar-type H +-ATPases are enzymes responsible for
        the energization of membranes and the acidification of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> within the eukaryotic cell via the
        establishment of proton and electrochemical gradients at
        the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. The vacuolar type H +-ATPase in plants
        is a large multimeric enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> whose function is to
        pump protons across a membrane via primary active
        transport. Vacuolar type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPases</ENAMEX> are homologs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthases and probably convert the free energy of
        hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate bond into
        rotational motion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Vacuolar type H
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+-ATPases</ENAMEX> are critical for the maintenance of homeostasis
        in eukaryotic cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        In plant cells V-ATPases are responsible for the
        deacidification of the cytosol and the energization of
        secondary transport processes across the tonoplast, as well
        as in the endocytotic and secretory pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition, the vacuolar type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPase</ENAMEX> is thought to be
        primarily responsible for the acidification and expansion
        of the large central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vacuole</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> a
        critical event in growth and development is the maturation
        and expansion of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vacuole</ENAMEX>. Upon maturation, the
        vacuolar contents can comprise more than eighty percent of
        the total cell volume [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Primarily filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vacuole</ENAMEX> also is a repository for a wide variety of
        solutes fulfilling numerous important metabolic functions.
        The influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and metabolites into the vacuole is
        dependent in part on the generation of a proton motive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> across the tonoplast.
        Vacuolar type H +-ATPases are large, multimeric enzyme
        complexes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">500-750</ENAMEX> kDa consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 or more</NUMEX> different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Structurally</ENAMEX>, they can be divided into integral
        (V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) and peripheral (V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ) membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The
        peripheral membrane sector is located on the cytoplasmic
        side of the membrane and is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX>
        different subunits including the catalytic subunit, subunit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> The V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> peripheral sector is further divided
        into a head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and stalk region. The V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> integral sector is embedded in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 4</NUMEX> different subunits.
        Subunit A of the vacuolar-type H +-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> is the
        catalytic subunit. The subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kDa in most organisms studied and is a hydrophilic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptide</ENAMEX> located in the head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the V 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> peripheral sector in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> copies per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holoenzyme</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . This subunit contains a nucleotide
        binding motif and functions to bind and hydrolyze <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] . In addition, subunit A contains a highly conserved
        cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> located within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX>' catalytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> that may be involved in regulation of the holoenzyme
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Cloning, sequencing and characteristics
        of subunit A of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-Type ATPase</ENAMEX> from 
        Arabidopsis thaliana have been
        previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        Small multigene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> subunit A are known
        to exist in flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algae</ENAMEX>. The catalytic
        subunit exists as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct genes with highly conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> and intron boundaries in twelve species of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . In the flowering plant 
        Daucus carota (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot</ENAMEX>) evidence
        exists for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct isoforms for the catalytic subunit,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which is tonoplast specific while the other is
        localized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct
        mRNAs have been isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> ( 
        Gossypium hirsutum ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Two
        subunit A mRNAs are expressed in the unicellular alga 
        Acetabularia acetabulum [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] .
        Isoforms of other V-ATPase subunits are also known from
        plants including subunit B [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 30 32</NUMEX> ] , the proteolipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] and subunits <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ]
        .
        What is lacking in our knowledge of vacuolar type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> is a sense of what purpose these multigene family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> may serve in the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">milieu</ENAMEX> and how they
        participate in the growth, development, and metabolism of
        higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. It has been proposed that multigene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        might be encoding functionally distinct isoforms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> subunits. These isoforms may be required to
        provide unique functions or regulatory constraints within
        the varied micro-compartments requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 39 43</NUMEX> ] . In addition, different isoforms may be
        responsible for targeting to varied subcellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 26 28 36 41 44 47</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, it is
        possible that gene family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may behave in a
        differential manner with respect to environmental stress [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> are primarily responsible for the
        maintenance of proton flux across the tonoplast in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
        the vacuolar H +-ATPase, the H +pumping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pyrophosphatase</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na +/H +antiporter</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX>
        enzymes have been implicated in allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> to cope
        with environmental stress conditions.
        Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to
        evaluate the role vacuolar type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> play in allowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> to cope with environmental stress. These endeavors
        have primarily concentrated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold stress</ENAMEX>. Cold
        tolerant 
        Brassica napus, a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> of 
        Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrated an
        increase in both subunit A mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in response to
        chilling at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2°C</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . This chilling also resulted in a
        concomitant increase in cell sap osmotic pressure and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous ABA</ENAMEX> accumulation. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> indicated
        that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> also was a cold tolerant
        plant which exhibited a similar response with respect to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> subunit A mRNA, however they provided no data. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX> ( 
        Oryza sativa ) chilling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> at
        10°C resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fold increase in vacuolar type
        ATPase activity evaluated by in vitro assay of isolated
        membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . This study did not analyze changes in
        protein level in the isolated membranes in response to
        chilling. Cold sensitive mung <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean seedlings</ENAMEX> ( 
        Vigna radiata ) subjected to chilling
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> contrastingly showed no increase in
        vacuolar type ATPase activity in isolated membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ]
        . In addition, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found no change in the
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels in response to
        chilling.
        The facultative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> plant 
        Mesembryanthemum
        crystallinum displays a differential organ level
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress while still engaged in C 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> photosynthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . Subjecting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> resulted in an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately two</NUMEX> fold
        increase in the transcript levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">subunits A</ENAMEX>, B, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolipid</ENAMEX> in roots prior to the shift to Crassulacean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid metabolism</ENAMEX>. Fully expanded leaves exhibited an
        increase only for the proteolipid mRNA, an increase of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> fold over non salt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stressed plants</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
        ] . Cell suspension cultures when subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress
        exhibited increase in activity of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-Type</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-Type</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> without concomitant increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>
        ] . Transcript levels of subunit E of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> in 
        Mesembryanthemum crystallinum were
        recently shown to increase in leaves but not roots of salt
        stressed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with a concomitant increase in protein
        levels in leaves [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, subunit E in 
        Hordeum vulgare showed no effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> level in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . The effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress on V-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> has also been investigated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX> ( 
        Nicotiana tabacum ) suspension cells.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subjecting NaCl</ENAMEX> adapted cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress resulted in an
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four</TIMEX> fold increase in both proton transport
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis on isolated membranes compared to
        unadapted cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Remarkably this increase in
        overall V-ATPase activity coincided with an apparent
        reduction in the amount of enzyme on the tonoplast. This
        apparently contradictory finding may be the result of
        physical changes in the enzyme itself or changes in the
        lipid environment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] . Especially confounding is the
        finding that mRNA levels for subunit A increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to four</TIMEX>
        fold in response to the same levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress in
        tobacco suspension cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Experiments with tomato (
        
        Lycopersicon esculentum ) showed
        similar results with respect to induction of mRNA for
        subunit A with an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately two to four</NUMEX> fold increase
        seen with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] . Recent work in
        the resurrection plant 
        Tortula ruralis indicated that
        transcript levels of the proteolipid (subunit c) increased
        in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress but that there was no
        corresponding increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] .
        The limited work done to evaluate the role of V-ATPases
        in drought stress has provided conflicting results. Drought
        stress in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> 
        Brassica <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">napus</ENAMEX> resulted in a very
        similar response as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold stress</ENAMEX>, that is a dramatic
        increase in subunit A mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . However, drought stress
        in 
        Lycopersicon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">esculentum</ENAMEX> resulted in
        no apparent increase in mRNA levels for subunit A [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ]
        .
        None of the previously mentioned efforts into evaluating
        the role of vacuolar type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPases</ENAMEX> in environmental stress
        acclimation take into account the fact that subunits A, B,
        and the proteolipid are most certainly present as small
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> studied. Furthermore, it is
        possible that these gene family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may behave in a
        differential manner with respect to stress. The only work
        published previously on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> subunit isoforms and
        stress is concerned with the proteolipid gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in 
        Arabidopsis thaliana. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
        proteolipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were evaluated for their response to salt
        stress as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">etiolation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
        exhibited an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately two</NUMEX> fold increase in mRNA levels
        in response to salt <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 mM</NUMEX>). However, with respect
        to etiolation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isoforms showed no response while the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> demonstrated an increase in mRNA levels.
        A number of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have been found to contain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple poly</ENAMEX> (A) attachment sites yielding different
        transcripts from a single gene. Several examples have
        recently emerged where differentially polyadenylated genes
        have transcripts that are post transcriptionally regulated
        based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> sensing. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> ( 
        Oryza sativa ), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcripts
        generated off an α amylase gene exhibit differential
        stability based on sucrose availability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . A cell
        wall invertase gene ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Incw-1</ENAMEX> ) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maize</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zea mays</ENAMEX> ) is expressed as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        transcripts differing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' ends. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transcripts are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed in response to sugars [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . In
        this study we explore the possibility that differentially
        polyadenylated transcripts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> subunit A
        encoding gene show different responses with respect to
        etiolation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, or chilling stress.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        A vacuolar type H +-ATPase subunit A cDNA has been
        previously identified and sequenced (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession
        number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U65638</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The cDNA was identified as subunit
        A of the vacuolar type H +-ATPase via identity with other
        previously sequenced subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        The primary nucleotide and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of the 
        A. thaliana subunit A cDNA showed a
        high degree of identity with subunit A cDNA sequenced from
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. This cDNA encoded a putative open reading
        frame consistent with that of other subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and was
        shown to have all the motifs common to subunit A [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] .
        This high degree of conservation was evident across taxa as
        diverse as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, fungi, and protozoa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Genome blot analysis was utilized to determine the
        number of genes in the 
        A. thaliana genome corresponding to
        subunit A of the vacuolar type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPase</ENAMEX>. Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was
        isolated as described, subjected to restriction enzyme
        digestion, and immobilized on a positively charged nylon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> single restriction enzyme digestions were
        performed. Hybridization was conducted at moderate
        stringency with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> base pair homologous 
        A. thaliana cDNA probe corresponding
        to subunit A of the vacuolar type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPase</ENAMEX>. Results indicated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to only a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hae III</ENAMEX> digest showed faint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to a second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> that was later shown to be
        the result of a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hae III</ENAMEX> site located in the region of
        the probe (results not shown).
        All evidences acquired to date failed to indicate the
        presence of a second V-ATPase subunit A gene in 
        A. thaliana. Whole genome blot
        analysis detected a single gene in the 
        A. thaliana genome. Extensive
        screening of a cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> derived from all organs and
        multiple developmental stages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> revealed only a
        single subunit A cDNA. A polymerase chain reaction based
        screen failed to detect an intron length polymorphism
        (results not shown) between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> found to be
        present in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Lastly, extensive database
        searches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>, the 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Arabidopsis EST</TIMEX> database, and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis Genome Initiative</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabidopsis</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>) report only a single subunit A
        gene in the current version of the 
        Arabidopsis genome (chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> BAC
        F9K20).
        This situation of a single subunit A gene appears to be
        unusual in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Admittedly only a small subset of plants
        has been examined in detail. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> examined to
        date <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> have only a single subunit A gene detected, the
        alga 
        Coleochaete scutata, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar beet</ENAMEX> ( 
        Beta vulgarise [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63 64</NUMEX> ] , and 
        A. thaliana [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Flowering plants
        shown to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oat</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avena</ENAMEX> sativa ), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot</ENAMEX> ( 
        Daucus carota ), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> ( 
        Nicotiana tabacum ), tomato ( 
        Lycopersicon esculentum ), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> ( 
        Gossypium hirsutum ), magnolia ( 
        Magnolia virginana ), 
        Hydrastis canadensis, Chenopodium
        rubrum, and clematis ( 
        Clematis liguisticfolio ). In
        addition, the unicellular alga 
        Acetabularia acetabulum has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> subunit A genes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot</ENAMEX> analysis was performed to determine the organ
        level expression pattern of the subunit A gene. Vacuolar
        type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPases</ENAMEX> are housekeeping enzymes critical for the
        maintenance of homeostasis. Therefore, it is expected that
        all living plant cells require V-ATPase function. Since 
        A. thaliana seemed to possess only a
        single gene for subunit A of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> it was expected
        that this gene should be expressed in all organs tested.
        Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was harvested from leaves, bolts, siliques,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, axenically grown seedlings, and axenically grown
        roots. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was denatured with glyoxal, fractionated via
        agarose gel electrophoresis, and immobilized on a
        positively charged nylon membrane. Hybridization was
        conducted at high stringency with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> base pair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">homologous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA probe</ENAMEX> labeled with digoxigenin. In
        agreement with our expectations, results indicated high
        levels of expression in all organs tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) with
        slightly higher levels of subunit A mRNA present in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seedlings</ENAMEX>. This is most likely due to the fact that
        seedlings are the most rapidly growing and metabolizing
        stage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> tested. Seedlings are undergoing
        dramatic and rapid vacuole biogenesis to allow for rapid
        growth at this stage of development and therefore would be
        expected to require a higher level of subunit A expression
        than other more terminally differentiated organs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Roots,</ENAMEX>
        leaves, bolts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> showed approximately equivalent
        amounts of signal with somewhat lower levels in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">siliques</ENAMEX>.
        Most eukaryotic mRNAs are characterized by the presence
        of a poly (A) tail, a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adenine residues</ENAMEX> post
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">transcriptionally</ENAMEX> attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' untranslated region.
        The primary function of the poly (A) tail is thought to be
        in message stability assisted by a series of poly (A)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . In addition, the poly (A) tail in
        conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' cap may be required for efficient
        translation of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNAs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] .
        Subunit A of the vacuolar type H +-ATPase in 
        A. thaliana was shown to exhibit
        multi site polyadenylation. Sequencing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' ends of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        independent clones isolated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PRL-2</ENAMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one EST</TIMEX> obtained through the 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Arabidopsis EST</TIMEX> database revealed
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different length transcripts produced from the single
        subunit A gene based on different poly (A) tail attachment
        sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Multiple polyadenylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are fairly
        common in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> mRNAs but this phenomenon is rare in animal
        genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 72</NUMEX> ] . Since the 
        A. thaliana <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> subunit A gene
        produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> different transcripts (all producing
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) and is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flowering plants
        observed to date not to have a multigene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for this
        subunit, experiments were designed to determine if muiti
        site polyadenylation might be a mechanism for gene
        regulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> proteolipid isoforms were shown to exhibit
        differential transcript expression levels in response to
        environmental stresses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . This fact implies a
        possible role for these isoforms in allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> to
        deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. Experiments were designed to determine
        if, in 
        A. thaliana, differentially
        polyadenylated transcripts could be regulated in response
        to stress.
        First, it was critical to confirm that subunit A
        transcript levels were at all responsive to environmental
        stress conditions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> environmental stresses were chosen
        including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, etiolation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>, and
        chilling at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 degrees</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        situations axenic, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day-old</TIMEX> seedlings grown on agar
        were evaluated. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seven day</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seedlings</ENAMEX> were chosen for
        their short growth time, limited space requirements, and
        ease in culturing. In addition, the facts that they are
        rapidly growing and metabolizing, were shown to produce
        ample quantities of subunit A transcript, and possess
        several organs including roots, hypocotyls, and cotyledons
        made them an attractive choice for analysis.
        Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot</ENAMEX> analysis was used <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to evaluate the
        overall response of subunit A to stress conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
        extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> treated seedlings and non-treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Hybridization was performed as previously
        described. Results indicated a subunit A transcript
        response to stress. An approximate <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-4</ENAMEX> fold increase in
        transcript level was detected in seedlings subjected to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> and chilling stress compared to control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Etiolated seedlings showed essentially equivalent
        amounts of subunit A transcript compared to controls. Since
        etiolation results in rapid elongation of seedlings it was
        expected that there would be a concomitant increase in
        subunit A messenger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as seen with proteolipid subunit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> in 
        A. thaliana [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and subunit A
        message levels in rapidly expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> ( 
        Gossypium hirsutum ) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] .
        Equivalent loading of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was evaluated via
        spectrophotometry measuring absorption at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer Lambda-3</ENAMEX> spectrophotometer and by visual
        confirmation using non denaturing ethidium bromide stained
        agarose gel electrophoresis (results not shown).
        Having established that overall subunit A transcript
        levels were responsive to environmental stress conditions
        an assay was designed to examine the response of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lengthed</ENAMEX> transcripts to the same stress
        conditions. The goal was to determine if any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        were differentially expressed in response to stress. A PCR
        based approach was taken to evaluate transcript levels for
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different subunit A mRNAs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primer</ENAMEX> pairs were
        designed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) that would only amplify one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        transcripts. This was accomplished by anchoring the
        downstream primer in the poly (A) tail. The upstream primer
        was located in the coding region of the subunit A cDNA.
        Anchoring the downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> in the poly (A) tail
        prevented that oligonucleotide from priming at any other
        site since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> nucleotides were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>'s at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end.
        The primer pairs were designed such that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        amplification products would differ in size by
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX> base pairs for ease of visualization on
        agarose gels and blots (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Primer pair <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-11</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">corresponds</ENAMEX> to transcript-1 and produce an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> product of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">579</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs. Primer pair <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-21</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-22</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">corresponds</ENAMEX> to transcript-2 and amplify a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">455</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-31</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-32</ENAMEX> correspond to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">transcript-3</ENAMEX> and amplify a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">362</NUMEX> base pair product. Lastly,
        primer pair <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-41</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-42</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">corresponds</ENAMEX> to transcript-4 and
        produce a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">238</NUMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> amplification product. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transcript-4 amplification</ENAMEX> product, which is the smallest
        and nested within the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, acted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> to detect
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> transcripts. This nesting was accomplished to
        avoid differences in signal during hybridization based on
        different probe lengths and labeling efficiency.
        A control experiment was performed prior to the actual
        stress analysis to ensure that the primer pairs amplified
        the correct transcript only and that the transcript-4 probe
        would detect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> amplification products. Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
        extracted from seedlings and cDNA was generated using oligo
        dT as described in materials and methods. Subunit A
        transcripts were amplified from the generated cDNA with the
        appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> pairs and transferred to solid support.
        Hybridization was performed at high stringency with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transcript-4 amplification</ENAMEX> product as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. The results of
        this experiment indicated that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primer</ENAMEX> pairs
        amplified only a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the appropriate and
        expected size and that the transcript-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> adequately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridized</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> amplification products (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        The differential expression of subunit A transcripts was
        evaluated in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold stress</ENAMEX>, and etiolation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Complementary DNA</ENAMEX>'s were generated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day-old</TIMEX>
        seedlings subjected to individual stress conditions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Transcripts 1-4</ENAMEX> were evaluated via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> using transcript
        specific primers. Amplification products were immobilized
        on solid support and hybridized with the transcript-4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> product. The results of this experiment
        indicate that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcripts behaved identically with
        respect to individual stress conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX>
        transcripts showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> fold increases in
        response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> stress compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">untreated</ENAMEX> controls. Similarly, treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
        degrees for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> resulted in a similar increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcripts. Etiolation resulted in
        slightly higher message levels for transcripts <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX>, and
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> compared to controls. The lesser degree of increase for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transcript-3</ENAMEX> might be due to near saturation of the signal.
        The latter might be due to the higher abundance of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>, or due to more efficient amplification of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">transcript-3</ENAMEX> primer set. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Transcript-4</ENAMEX> seems to show
        slightly less signal than control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> but the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoradiograph</ENAMEX> is somewhat under developed. These results
        are in agreement with the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> stress blot analysis.
        Apparent quantitative differences in upregulation between
        transcripts shown in (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) might be due to differential
        amplification efficiency of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different primer sets
        and do not necessarily represent true differential
        upregulation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcripts. The data can only be
        evaluated quantitatively between samples amplified with the
        same primer set. In summation, no significant differential
        regulation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> subunit A transcripts was detected
        in seedlings in response to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stress conditions
        evaluated.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Evidence gathered to date indicates the presence of a
        single gene encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+-ATPase</ENAMEX> in 
        A. thaliana. The search for
        additional subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was conducted using whole genome
        blot analysis, screening a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lambda PRL-2</ENAMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>,
        intron length polymorphism analysis, and extensive computer
        searches of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arabidopsis Expressed Sequence Tag</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genome Initiative</ENAMEX>. Most
        flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> evaluated to date have a small multigene
        family encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H +-ATPase.
        The small size of the 
        A. thaliana genome may be indicative
        of a trend toward streamlining of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, which
        may have eliminated a redundant subunit A gene over
        evolutionary time. Subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and subsequently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are highly conserved. Therefore, it is not likely
        that a subunit A gene would have escaped the screen by
        having a low degree of nucleotide identity.
        Vacuolar type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPases</ENAMEX> are housekeeping enzymes probably
        needed in all living plant cells. The single 
        A. thaliana subunit A gene was shown
        by whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot</ENAMEX> analysis to be transcribed in all organs
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> tested. The organs analyzed included roots,
        leaves, bolts, siliques, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. In addition,
        relatively high levels of transcript were found in whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seedlings</ENAMEX>. These results support the notion of a single
        subunit A gene in 
        A. thaliana that is transcribed in
        all cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.
        Numerous examples are present in the literature [see [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] and references therein] of changes in transcript,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, or activity levels of vacuolar type H +-ATPases in
        response to environmental stress. These results indicate a
        potential role for the vacuolar type H +-ATPase in
        maintenance of homeostasis during times of environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA blot analysis</ENAMEX> performed on seedlings
        exposed to environmental stress conditions indicated that
        transcript levels of subunit A were responsive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold stress</ENAMEX> treatments. Transcript levels were shown to
        increase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> fold in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seedlings</ENAMEX> treated with
        cold and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etiolation</ENAMEX> did not produce as
        significant a change in transcript level as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and cold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
        The single vacuolar type H +-ATPase subunit A gene
        detected in 
        A. thaliana can produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX>
        different length transcripts by using different
        polyadenylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. These transcripts differ only in
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' untranslated region and produce identical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The presence of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'end
        of the subunit A gene could be a potential mechanism by
        which this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is post transcriptionally regulated.
        However, the evidence gathered in this work indicates
        that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different transcripts generated off the
        single subunit A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> are not significantly differentially
        regulated in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>, chilling, or etiolation in
        axenically grown seedlings. Multi site polyadenylation does
        not appear to be a mechanism for posttranscriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of gene expression for subunit A of the vacuolar

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio State University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus OH</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Seeds</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germinated</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-inch</NUMEX> pots according to standard
          protocols. Axenic seedlings, and soil grown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> were
          maintained in a growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23°C</TIMEX> under a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16-hour</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoperiod</ENAMEX> until appropriate organs were mature. Axenic
          seedling cultures were prepared by placing surface

          allowed to dry under a laminar flow hood, sealed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraflim</ENAMEX> and incubated vertically as above. Roots were
          harvested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-14 days later</TIMEX>.
          Growth effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> stress were evaluated by
          germinating surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sterilized seeds</ENAMEX> on agar containing
          various concentrations of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX>. The optimal

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days later</TIMEX>. Plantlets exhibited the typical
          characteristics of etiolation, the hypocotyls were
          lengthened and the cotyledons reduced compared to light
          grown controls.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cold stress</ENAMEX> was evaluated by germinating surface
