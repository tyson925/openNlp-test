        Normal wound healing requires fibroblast proliferation
        and migration into the wound bed followed by tightly
        regulated matrix deposition and contraction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberrations</ENAMEX> in
        these processes can lead to excessive collagen accumulation
        as found in keloids. These scars extend beyond the original
        wound margins and are excluded from glabrous surfaces
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, soles). When grown in vitro keloid fibroblast
        cultures contain a high percentage of Î±-smooth muscle actin
        (Î±-SMA) expressing cells - myofibroblasts. In spite of
        numerous studies the etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">keloid</ENAMEX> formation remains
        obscure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] . However, as TGFÎ²1
        regulates the expression and deposition of collagenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> (ECM) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] it is expected that
        keloids develop due to aberrant responses to this cytokine.
        While in vitro analyses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TGFÎ²1</TIMEX> levels in keloid and
        normal fibroblasts have yielded variable results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] , higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGFÎ²1 receptors</ENAMEX> and Smad3
        activation were recently reported in keloid fibroblasts [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . Thus, procedures that lower TGFÎ²1 expression may
        help prevent keloid development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 18 22</NUMEX> ] .
        TGFÎ²1 also supports the differentiation of fibroblasts
        into myofibroblasts, which are a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> of the
        granulation tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . The process depends upon the
        deformability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 25</NUMEX> ] and is mediated by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED-A</ENAMEX> splice variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibronectin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>-A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibronectin</ENAMEX> is expressed in the initial stages of wound
        healing and along with collagen I is positively regulated
        by TGFÎ²1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Progression of granulation tissue to neodermis requires
        a decrease in cellularity through apoptosis of endothelial
        cells, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . Keloid
        fibroblasts demonstrate aberrant apoptotic behavior [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX>
        ] although studies have given variable results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 9 11 30</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . Our initial data for
        serum-starvation-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in monolayer cultures of
        dermal fibroblasts demonstrated delayed apoptosis of keloid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and a negative correlation with Î±-SMA
        expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Similar correlations were observed in
        rat lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGFÎ²1</ENAMEX> increased Î±-SMA content
        while acting as an antiapoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . It
        should be noted however, that many of the myofibroblasts
        were still able to undergo apoptosis consistent with in
        vivo data on palatal wound healing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFÎ²1</ENAMEX> can
        promote both Î±-SMA expression in the initial stages of
        wound healing and apoptosis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> stages of wound
        healing. The latter effect may be related to the apoptosis
        induced by relaxation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> or of the collagen gel [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] .
        In order to follow both the differentiation of
        fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and their apoptosis in
        relation to the tension in the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>, we utilized
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-color FACS analyses. Experiments were carried out with
        human dermal fibroblasts of different origins - keloid,
        nonaffected palmar sites of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        normal fibroblasts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, heels or nonpalmoplantar
        sites. Î±-SMA content and apoptosis were evaluated as a
        function of serum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFÎ²1</ENAMEX> and collagen type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. The</ENAMEX> observed
        phenotypic differences between fibroblasts grown from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glabrous</ENAMEX> vs. nonglabrous tissue suggest a reason for the
        exclusion of keloids from specific body sites of keloid
        prone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell growth, media, collagen coating and embedding
          in rafts
          Skin samples from palmoplantar (PP) and non-PP loci
          were obtained under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">keloid</ENAMEX> prone and normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Biopsies were
          rinsed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, minced into small fragments and
          epidermis separated from dermis using a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4Â°C overnight</TIMEX>
          incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dispase II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX>). The
          epidermis was then removed with forceps and the dermal
          pieces were incubated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collagenase D</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 mg/ml</ENAMEX> in 
          collagenase buffer (see below)) for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-30 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Any cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> were collected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> and resuspended in trypsin<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/EDTA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> with occasional shaking. Fetal bovine serum
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> was added at the end to neutralize the trypsin. Cells
          were harvested by centrifugation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> rpm in a clinical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifuge</ENAMEX>) and were grown and serially passaged as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . For experiments, cells from
          passages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four to six</NUMEX> were used with an initial plating
          density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX> cells/mm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. When added, ascorbic acid
          and TGFÎ²1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D Systems</ENAMEX>) were used at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX>, respectively. Fetal bovine serum(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyclone</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> was
          used as supplement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> (low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose DMEM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GIBCO</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRL</ENAMEX>)) when indicated.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> type I coated plates were prepared by
          incubating tissue culture plates with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mg rat</ENAMEX> tail
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen per ml Phosphate Buffered Saline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hrs
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature, followed by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 min</NUMEX>, 37Â°C
          incubation with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSA</ENAMEX> (bovine serum albumin) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ethylene DiamineTetraacetic acid</ENAMEX> (EDTA) -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS/EDTA</ENAMEX>, and final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> washes.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> gels (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml) were prepared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> harvested at confluence and resuspended to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          6cells/ml collagen solution (see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> ml of
          this cell suspension was added per well of a 6 well plate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nunc</ENAMEX>). Gel relaxation was achieved by full detachment
          with a spatula. Gels with keloid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> tend to
          shrink, but remain attached to the center of the well. To
          harvest cells the gels were first incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trypsin/EDTA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml trypsin;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0.25</NUMEX> mM EDTA) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> min
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, and then with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 Î¼l</NUMEX> collagenase <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 mg/ml</ENAMEX>;

          The reaction was stopped by addition of fetal bovine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. Cells were collected by centrifugation at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> rpm and the resultant pellet was washed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          3H-Thymidine incorporation
          Fibroblasts at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> confluence were incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> hrs
          in serum-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMEM</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 Î¼Ci/ml methyl-</ENAMEX>

          were harvested by trypsinization, sonicated, and
          incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> hr in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> tri-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">chloro</NUMEX>-acetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (TCA) on

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCA</ENAMEX> and once with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, before
          being dried and counted in an LKB liquid scintillation
          counter. The cell number was determined by direct

          analysis
          For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> assay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one million</NUMEX> cells were fixed
          by suspension in the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> tissue fixative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HistoChoice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amresco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> at room

        Results and Discussion
        
          Growth rates and morphologic characteristics of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palmoplantar</ENAMEX> and non-palmoplantar fibroblasts
          The proliferation of preconfluent fibroblasts grown on
          tissue culture plastic was measured as a function of
          3H-thymidine incorporation into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TCA-precipitates</ENAMEX>. As
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, fibroblasts, derived either from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">palmar</ENAMEX> skin of keloid-forming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> or the plantar skin
          of nonaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, incorporated more 3H-thymidine
          than did those isolated from keloid or normal nonglabrous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">trunk</ENAMEX> skin. This apparent difference in proliferation
          rate is consistent with the microscopic observation (data
          not shown) that palmoplantar (PP) fibroblasts reached
          confluence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 days earlier</TIMEX> than did the non-palmoplantar
          (non-PP) cultures, when plated at the same density.
          Earlier work from other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> had indicated that
          normal fibroblasts grew more quickly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , similarly [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 43</NUMEX> ] or more slowly [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 34</NUMEX> ] than did keloid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>. Such variations may reflect differences in
          culture conditions at the time of assay. For example, in
          confluent cultures the growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> fibroblasts
          slows to less than that of non-PP fibroblasts (results
          not shown).
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> cultures can also be
          distinguished by a paucity of fibroblasts with high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">granularity</ENAMEX> (side scattering), a characteristic often
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the elaboration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RER</ENAMEX> (rough endoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reticulum</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . In both confluent and post-confluent

          granularity were found in the non-PP isolates (keloid and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonplantar</ENAMEX>). The differences in proliferation rate and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">granularity</ENAMEX> predict and are consistent with differences
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression [ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , below]. Palmar, but not

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGFÎ²1 receptor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED-A</ENAMEX> fibronectin in palmoplantar
          and non-palmoplantar fibroblasts
          Earlier work demonstrated that palmoplantar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> express less Î±-SMA than do keloid or to a
          lesser extent normal non-palmoplantar fibroblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
          . As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFÎ²1</ENAMEX> is a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of Î±-SMA, these
          observations could reflect the relative levels of active
          TGFÎ²1 or the levels of those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> responsible for the
          transduction of its signal. We therefore measured the
          expression of Î±-SMA together with of the expression of
          those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> participating in the initial signal
          transduction event<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">: TGFÎ²1</TIMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> receptor
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX>-RII), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED-A</ENAMEX> fibronectin. No consistent
          differences were detected in the levels of intracellular
          or secreted, latent or active TGFÎ²1 (data not shown).
          However, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Figs.</ENAMEX> 3(for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> analysis examples,
          please, see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: Additional data <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1.ppt</NUMEX>),
          the expression of both TGFÎ²1-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RII</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED-A</ENAMEX> fibronectin was
          lower in PP cultures than in non-PP cultures. In contrast
          to previous reports [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , the level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX>-RII in
          keloid fibroblast cultures was similar to that in plantar
          cultures or even lower than that of normal nonplantar
          fibroblast cultures - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Î±-SMA content correlated
          most closely with the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ED-A fibronectin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). For keloid fibroblasts, the size and granularity of
          the Î±-SMA expressing cells was similar to those
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED-A</ENAMEX> fibronectin rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX>-RII (not
          shown, please, see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: Additional data
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2.ppt</NUMEX>). Cells with the highest granularity expressed
          TGFÎ²1-RII, while cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium granularity</ENAMEX> had high
          levels of Î±-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED-A</ENAMEX> fibronectin (not shown, please,
          see additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: Additional data <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2.ppt</NUMEX>). Together
          with our previous results demonstrating higher levels of
          thrombospondin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in keloid fibroblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , the data
          suggest that 
          
            keloid fibroblasts (and to a lesser
            extent normal non-PP fibroblasts) appear primed to more
            effectively transmit the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX> signal and thereby to

          with an increased accumulation of Î±-SMA, although the

          Simultaneous evaluation of apoptosis was carried out.
          Serum withdrawal increased the percentage of apoptotic

          please, see additional files: Additional data <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3.ppt</NUMEX>) - a
          considerable number of which were Î±-SMA positive. The
          impact of serum withdrawal was found to be greater in PP
          cultures than in non-PP cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). In addition,
          during serum starvation <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> fibroblasts
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detached</ENAMEX> and were found floating. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> analysis
          demonstrated that these cells were all apoptotic (not
          shown, see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ). Although TGFÎ²1 acted
          anti-apoptotically in PP cultures (palmar and normal
          plantar fibroblasts) and prevented the shedding of cells
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, its effect was dissimilar in non-PP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, where TGFÎ²1 had either no impact (keloid T and
          normal nonplantar fibroblasts) or was pro-apoptotic
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">keloid</TIMEX> D cultures).
          In the presence of serum, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TGFÎ²1</TIMEX> acted
          anti-apoptotically only on the normal plantar cultures
          and was without observable effect on the palmar cultures
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). However, the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX> to the non-PP
          cultures always resulted in increased apoptosis in the
          presence of serum: in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">keloid</TIMEX> D small increases were
          observed and in keloid T and in normal nonplantar
          cultures large increases were observed.
          
            
              Thus, in contrast to the ability of
              TGFÎ²1 to induce the expression of Î±-SMA in all
              fibroblast cultures, its effect on apoptosis was
              fibroblast-origin dependent. 
             
          
        
        
          Impact of collagen on levels of Î±-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> and apoptosis
          in fibroblasts
          Measurements were made of the Î±-SMA content and
          apoptotic status of fibroblasts embedded within attached
          or detached(relaxed) gels incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> in the
          presence or absence of serum and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TGFÎ²1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6and 7</ENAMEX>).
          The data were compared with those obtained prior to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embedding</ENAMEX> and with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three day</TIMEX> post confluent monolayer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A,5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). In attached gels, Î±-SMA content
          modestly increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> fibroblasts (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UL</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a'</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A; for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> at confluence see examples in
          Additional data <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX>). TGFÎ²1 further induced the expression
          of Î±-SMA (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UL</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A), although in no
          instance were the levels increased to those observed in
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three day</TIMEX> postconfluent cultures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 5A</ENAMEX>). In
          contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> fibroblasts the Î±-SMA content of keloid
          and normal non-PP fibroblasts did not increase post
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> embedding. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TGFÎ²1</TIMEX> was modestly effective at
          increasing Î±-SMA levels in keloid and normal non-PP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). The inability of keloid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> to respond with increased Î±-SMA to TGFÎ²1 may
          be a consequence of their ability to initiate gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX> (only the central portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gel</ENAMEX> remained
          attached) and apoptosis. In relaxed gels there was no
          detectable increase in Î±-SMA in palmar fibroblasts and a
          decrease in Î±-SMA in keloid fibroblasts. Most of the
          fibroblasts were apoptotic (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6c</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c'</TIMEX>).
          Similar results were obtained with normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> and normal
          non-PP fibroblasts.
          The impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> (collagen) on Î±-SMA accumulation was
          also evaluated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other experimental settings (data
          not shown): monolayer cultures of fibroblasts grown with
          ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to permit collagen secretion, and monolayer
          cultures of fibroblasts grown on collagen I coated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX>. In both settings Î±-SMA levels were reduced
          compared to controls grown on noncoated tissue culture
          plastic or without ascorbic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (see similar results in
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] ). Taken together these results suggest that the
          presence of collagen and the stressed to relaxed state
          transition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> alters or dominates TGFÎ²1 signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> (see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ). The corresponding
          reduction in Î±-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMA</ENAMEX> is in agreement with recent in vivo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on splintered vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">unsplintered rat</ENAMEX> wounds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] ,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
          When apoptosis was evaluated, it was found to increase
          significantly in all fibroblast types within attached
          gels by comparison to the input fibroblasts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
          Many of the apoptotic cells were Î±-SMA positive (see UR
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Previous reports indicating a lack of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in attached gels were based on analyses using
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ELISA</ENAMEX> that did not allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> of events in
          apoptosis which precede the formation of a nucleosomal
          ladder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Experiments aimed at evaluating keloid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> in attached gels were confounded by the
          ability of these fibroblasts to contract the gels and
          cause partial gel relaxation with concomitant apoptosis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6a</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7B</TIMEX>). Thus, while keloid fibroblasts did not
          readily undergo apoptosis in response to serum-starvation
          in monolayer cultures, they underwent the most apoptosis
          once embedded in attached gels, due to the
          self-relaxation of these gels. At the same time and under
          the same conditions the corresponding palmar fibroblasts
          showed lower apoptosis levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6b</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7B</TIMEX>). TGFÎ²1 had
          minor and variable effect on apoptosis in attached gels
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
          Upon gel relaxation (i.e. after full detachment)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> significantly increased (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6c, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c'</TIMEX>).
          In contrast to monolayer cultures exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFÎ²1</ENAMEX> did not
          alter apoptosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6c, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c'</TIMEX>, data not shown). This is
          consistent with other data on gel-embedded foreskin
          fibroblasts, which led to the conclusion that prior
          differentiation into myofibroblasts is not required for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in granulation tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Our data on
          attached gels (when Î±-SMA positive fibroblasts were
          present even without exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGFÎ²1</ENAMEX>) demonstrated that a
          considerable percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myofibroblasts</ENAMEX> underwent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6a, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a'</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b'</TIMEX>, and data not shown).
          The decrease in percentage of myofibroblasts in the
          relaxed gels containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">keloid fibroblasts</ENAMEX> (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          6b, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6b'with Fig</ENAMEX>. 6c, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c'</TIMEX>) may be due to a gradual
          turnover of Î±-SMA in the cells undergoing apoptosis. In
          the scheme presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4this process would
          correspond to the phenotypic conversion of apoptotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myofibroblasts</ENAMEX> (UR) to apoptotic fibroblasts (LR) by
          proteolysis of Î±-SMA. However, during granulation tissue
          remodeling in vivo, decreased cellularity may be the
          result of apoptosis of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] .
          Our findings showed that 
          
            reduction of tension in the ECM
            provokes apoptosis and reduces Î±-SMA; as human dermal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myofibroblasts</ENAMEX> readily undergo apoptosis in response to
            gel relaxation (or wound contraction) their absence
            from the neodermis of a healed wound is likely the
            result of apoptosis. 
           
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        There are several issues addressed for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> relating apoptosis and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myofibroblast</ENAMEX> formation
        in human dermal fibroblasts.
        
          Phenotypic differences exist among
          fibroblasts from different dermal origin 
        
        - non-palmoplantar (non-PP) or palmoplantar (PP) -
        normal (nonplantar, plantar, palmar from keloid patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsies</ENAMEX>) or abnormal (from keloid biopsies). Our work
        demonstrated that keloid fibroblasts had higher cellular
        levels of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX> pathway (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX>-RII
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED-A</ENAMEX> fibronectin; also thrombospondin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ). In
        addition TGFÎ²1 effects on apoptosis differed in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> vs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> fibroblasts. TGFÎ²1 acted pro-apoptotically on non-PP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotically</ENAMEX> on PP fibroblasts. It
        had a pro-apoptotic effect on myofibroblasts. These results
        suggest that, at least in part, the difference between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keloid</ENAMEX> and palmar fibroblasts may be due to particular
        levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TGFÎ²1</NUMEX>-pathway related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at nonglabrous vs.
        glabrous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
        
          Effect of tension in the ECM 
        
        - We found that matrix tension was dominant over TGFÎ²1
        in determining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myofibroblast</ENAMEX> formation and apoptosis
        levels. Apoptotic cells predominated in relaxed gels,
        independent of TGFÎ²1 availability. Keloid fibroblasts, once
        embedded in collagen gels - an environment exerting less
        tension on the fibroblasts - were more apoptotic than the
        corresponding palmar fibroblasts. This difference may be
        attributed to the ability of keloid fibroblasts to contract
        the collagen gel.
        For the exuberant accumulation of collagen during keloid
        formation, matrix relaxation-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> must be
        delayed. This suggests that body-site specific keloid
        formation may be dependent on the difference in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and resolution of tension in the wound bed at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonglabrous</ENAMEX> vs. glabrous sites in keloid prone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Thus a necessary requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">keloid</ENAMEX> formation will be
        maintenance of tension to prevent (delay) apoptosis. This
        gives sufficient time for the fibroblasts to express and
        deposit collagen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>. With the accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> the tension experienced by the fibroblasts in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keloid</ENAMEX> will be reduced and apoptosis initiated. According
        to our data reduced tension would lead to lowering of the
        Î±-SMA level in the keloid.
        Although myofibroblasts were not detected in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ]
        , the propensity of keloid fibroblasts to express Î±-SMA in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> and the loss of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> upon matrix contraction
        (gel relaxation) do not allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to dismiss a role for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myofibroblasts</ENAMEX> in keloids. Rather it may be necessary to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">re-evaluate Î±</ENAMEX>-SMA expression in the early stages of keloid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, when tension within the wound bed is high.
        Usually the studied keloids are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least several months</TIMEX> old
        and may have had enough time for tension relaxation and
        loss of Î±-SMA. Interestingly, keloids in some Caucasian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were found to contain Î±-SMA positive fibroblasts [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] . Many of the Î±-SMA positive cells were
        spindle-shaped, which suggests that these cells experienced
        outside tension. Furthermore, persisting tension in the
        wound bed may explain why hypertrophic scars maintain the
        myofibroblast phenotype long after wound closure.
        Fibroblasts at glabrous sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, soles) do not
        promote <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">keloid</ENAMEX> formation consistent with an earlier
        reduction in cellularity, necessary for a normal wound
        healing. It is noteworthy that tension/mechanical loading
        is exerted through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> by fibroblasts expressing a
        "synthetic" fibroblast phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . As TGFÎ²1 supports
        this phenotype, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">keloid</ENAMEX> formation at glabrous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may be
        further limited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> fibroblast requirement for higher
        and/or more sustained levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TGFÎ²1</TIMEX>.
        Clinical applications of pressure dressings that relieve
        wound bed tension are traditionally used to prevent
        aberrant scar formation during burn wound healing.
        Comparisons of non-pressure vs. pressure-treated
        hypertrophic scars have shown that pressure supports the
        disappearance of Î±-SMA expressing myofibroblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] .
        The data presented in this work suggest that body site
        differences in fibroblasts and wound tension are critical
        determinants of the keloid-less healing of palmoplantar
        wounds of keloid-prone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
