        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gene entrapment</ENAMEX> has provided effective strategies for
        insertional mutagenesis of mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in culture. The
        mutagens permit direct selection of clones in which
        cellular genes have been disrupted and simplify the
        characterisation of genes associated with recessive
        mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Mutagenesis of embryo-derived stem (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>)
        cells, coupled with in vitro genetic screens, has been
        widely used to analyse gene functions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . These
        have included screens for mutations in developmentally
        regulated genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] , in genes regulated by
        extracellular agonists [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secreted</ENAMEX> and transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Characterized
        mutations include genes involved in intracellular
        trafficking [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , transcriptional regulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 11 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] , neural
        development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and neural wiring [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and axial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patterning</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . The rapid expansion of the nucleic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid databases</ENAMEX> has had a tremendous impact on the
        identification of genes disrupted by gene entrapment. This
        has led to the development of tagged sequence mutagenesis,
        a process by which genes disrupted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are
        characterized at the nucleotide level prior to germline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        Gene trap retroviruses developed in our laboratory
        contain a selectable marker in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the U3</TIMEX> region of the long
        terminal repeat (LTR) of a replication-defective Moloney
        murine <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> virus. Selection for U3 gene expression
        generates clones in which the provirus is positioned in or
        near exons of actively transcribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and is expressed
        on transcripts originating in the flanking cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vectors</ENAMEX> appear to be effective mutagens.
        Single-gene mutation frequencies are <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-1000</ENAMEX> fold higher
        in cells isolated after gene trap selection than in cells
        containing randomly integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retroviruses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . These
        targeting frequencies also support the idea that retrovirus
        can integrate throughout the genome and that most, if not
        all, expressed genes can be disrupted. Finally,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40%</NUMEX> of inserts selected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells result in
        obvious phenotypes following transmission into the mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germline</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases examined, the
        virus appeared to induce null mutations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 30 31 32</NUMEX> ]
        .
        In order to best utilise gene traps in genetic studies,
        it is necessary to understand the factors that allow
        expression of the entrapment vectors and that determine
        whether expression of the occupied gene will be disrupted.
        This is particularly true for tagged sequence mutagenesis,
        where one would like to predict by sequence alone the
        effects of the targeting vector on cellular gene
        expression. For this, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> number inserts must
        be characterised including those not associated with any
        discernible phenotype. Most previously analysed mutations
        were selected because of phenotypes observed after germline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX>, and thus are unlikely to reveal mechanisms
        that could allow expression of the entrapment vector
        without disrupting expression of the occupied gene.
        The present study characterized a mutation in the 1B4
        cell line induced by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U3Neo</NUMEX> gene trap retrovirus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        . This insert was selected for study because the provirus
        inserted into a widely expressed gene and yet no phenotype
        was observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> homozygous for the provirus. Further
        analysis revealed that the provirus integrated into an
        intron of murine homologue of the human hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene.
        The gene encodes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related nuclear ribonucleoproteins,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hnRNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> and hnRNP <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding proteins</ENAMEX> found associated with mammalian
        heterogeneous nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          The 1B4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provirus</ENAMEX> integrates into the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNPA2/</ENAMEX>B1
          gene
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1B4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line was isolated by infecting D3 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>
          cells with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U3Neo</NUMEX> gene trap retrovirus and selecting
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G418</TIMEX> resistant clones [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . 1B4 cells contain a
          single, intact provirus as assessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Sequences flanking the
          virus, isolated by inverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, hybridized to a
          transcript of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kb</ENAMEX>, and were used to
          screen a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PCC3</NUMEX> embryonal carcinoma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. A
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> positive plaques were identified among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          6plaques screened. Further analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> cDNAs revealed
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> overlapping clones covering the entire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> Kb
          transcript. The composite cDNA contained an open reading
          frame encoding a polypeptide of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Comparison of the translated sequence to the GenBank
          database using the BLASTP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] revealed a
          significant match with human hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2/B1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are identical except asparagine
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">287</NUMEX> in the human sequence was replaced by a threonine
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse cDNA sequence</ENAMEX> has been deposited in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> (accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AF073993</NUMEX>).
          In order to determine where the provirus inserted
          within the hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene, genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> flanking the 1B4
          provirus was sequenced. The flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inverse PCR</ENAMEX> extended to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HinfI</ENAMEX> site <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">226</NUMEX> nucleotides
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and downstream of the provirus (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Sequences matching the cloned cDNA and the human hnRNP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> cDNA extended <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">64 nucleotides</TIMEX> downstream of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HinfI</ENAMEX> site, while the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">159</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> did not
          match the cDNA sequence. A consensus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' splice site was
          located at the point where the genomic and cDNA sequences
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diverged</ENAMEX>. Therefore <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1B4</TIMEX> provirus appeared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">integrate 159</ENAMEX> nucleotides into an intron of the hnRNP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene. The flanking sequence has been submitted to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> (accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AF073990</NUMEX>).
          The fact that the flanking genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> hybridized to a
          single genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment suggested that the provirus
          inserted into the hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene and not into a related
          but uncharacterized gene. However, since the match was
          based on a relatively short stretch of exon, several
          experiments were performed to confirm linkage between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">provirus</ENAMEX> and the hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene. First, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primers
          complementary to hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> sequences located upstream
          and downstream of the provirus were used together with a
          neo specific primer in separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions. In each
          case, the size of the amplified product was consistent
          with insertion of the provirus into the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNPA2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene
          (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, cDNA sequences predicted to lie
          downstream of the integration site were used to probe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blots. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2/B1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA probe</ENAMEX> hybridized
          to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 kB</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EcoR1</ENAMEX> fragment corresponding to the wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> kB fragment in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> containing
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1B4</NUMEX> provirus (data not shown). The difference in the
          size of the wild type and mutant alleles resulted from
          the inserted U3Neo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">provirus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finally</ENAMEX>, as described below,
          U3Neo transcripts expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B4</NUMEX> cells are fused to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">upstream hnRNP A2/B1 sequences.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Provirus</ENAMEX> integration does not disrupt expression of
          the hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene
          Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> U3 gene trap proviruses selected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>
          cells that we have introduced into the germline, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          resulted in obvious phenotypes (typically embryonic
          death) when bred to homozygosity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 21 28 29 30 31 32</NUMEX> ]
          . In cases where no obvious phenotypes are observed, it
          is important to determine if the insert did not disrupt
          gene expression or if the gene is dispensable.
          Inheritance of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1B4</NUMEX> provirus followed a Mendelian
          distribution and no phenotypic changes were observed.
          Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> analyzed after crossing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          heterozygous for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1B4</TIMEX> provirus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> failed to inherit
          the provirus, while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 and 13</TIMEX> were heterozygous and
          homozygous for the provirus, respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">representative Southern blot</ENAMEX> used to genotype offspring
          is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          To test whether the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1B4</NUMEX> provirus disrupts expression
          of the hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          homozygous for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1B4</TIMEX> provirus were analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> hybridization, using hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> cDNA probes derived
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sequences</NUMEX> upstream and downstream of the integration
          site. All tissues from wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> expressed a single,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> kb transcript, consistent with previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice homozygous</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1B4</TIMEX> provirus expressed the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> kb transcript as well as an additional, larger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The size of this larger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.3</NUMEX> kb as compared to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">18S</ENAMEX> and 28S <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, is consistent with fusion
          of upstream hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> exons to the Neo gene. Sequences
          derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hnRNPA2/B1</ENAMEX> sequences downstream of the site
          of integration also hybridized to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> kb transcript
          in both wild type and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1B4</ENAMEX> homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> indicating that
          transcription of full-length hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> transcripts is
          not completely disrupted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1B4</TIMEX> provirus.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse embryonic fibroblasts</ENAMEX> (MEF) were isolated from
          both wild type and homozygous mutant embryos. MEF
          isolated from embryos homozygous for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1B4</TIMEX> provirus
          showed no obvious differences from those isolated from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> or wild type embryos. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEFs</ENAMEX> was used to quantify the extent of message
          reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B4</TIMEX> homozygous cells by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>. When using probes derived from cDNA
          sequences downstream of the integration site northern
          blot analysis revealed a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction of transcripts in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutants</ENAMEX> compared to wild type using the glyceraldehyde
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-phosphate dehydrogenase</TIMEX> (GAPDH) message as an internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Splicing</ENAMEX> and polyadenylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1-Neo</ENAMEX>
          fusion transcripts
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U3Neo</NUMEX> provirus contains sequences for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' processing and polyadenylation. Continued expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1</ENAMEX> transcripts suggests that use of the viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is less efficient than removal of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">provirus</ENAMEX> resides. To determine
          whether mutation of viral <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' processing signals was
          responsible for continued hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> expression, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
          base pair region spanning the polyadenylation signal in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> was amplified from integrated provirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX>. However, the sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was
          identical to the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Moloney murine leukemia</ENAMEX> virus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          The question remained as to how hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX>-neo fusion
          transcripts are expressed. Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Northern blot</ENAMEX>
          analysis found high levels of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> Kb fusion transcript
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B4</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , approximately the size expected for
          hnRNPA2/neo fusion transcripts terminating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that fusion transcripts may combine
          the proximal upstream hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1 exon, 5</ENAMEX>' splice site,
          flanking intron and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LTR</ENAMEX> into a single, terminal exon.
          However, this possibility contradicts current models of
          exon definition in which exons in pre-mRNA are first
          defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> interacting across exons and then
          processed as relatively autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Alternatively,
          the proximal hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> exon may maintain its autonomy
          and splice to a cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site, located either in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> or in the adjacent intron.
          To distinguish between these alternatives, hnRNP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1/Neo</ENAMEX> fusion transcripts expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>
          cells were analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>). A primer complementary to the Neo gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NeoA</ENAMEX>)
          was used to prime first strand cDNA synthesis. Primers
          complementary to adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1</ENAMEX> exon sequences (PR1
          or PR2) and a neo-specific primer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NeoB</ENAMEX>) were used to
          amplify transcripts extending from the hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene
          into the provirus (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). Transcripts extending
          through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5</TIMEX>' splice site, proximal intron and into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">provirus</ENAMEX> would produce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> products of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">917 and 598</NUMEX>
          nucleotides with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PR1 and PR2</TIMEX>, respectively. As shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>, the size of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCR product</ENAMEX> from each
          reaction was significantly smaller than expected for
          transcripts colinear with the flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the
          major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products did not hybridize to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U3</NUMEX>-specific
          oligo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5C</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> independent RT-PCR
          products were cloned from separate amplification
          reactions and sequenced. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5D</TIMEX>, all of
          these transcripts spliced from the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' splice
          site in the hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene to a cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site
          located in the Neo gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5D</NUMEX>). Characteristic of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> splice site contained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PyAG</ENAMEX> and a
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point sequence but lacked a
          poly-pyrimidine stretch. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site is downstream
          of the initiation codon for neomycin phosphotransferase.
          Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNPA2/B1</ENAMEX>-Neo transcripts are expected to
          encode a fusion protein consisting of the amino terminal
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1</ENAMEX> fused to amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of
          the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> also detected several minor RT-PCR
          products upon prolonged exposure (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5C</NUMEX>). We were
          unable to clone these products due to their low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX>. However, they were smaller than expected for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcripts</ENAMEX> co-linear with the flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and may arise
          from cryptic splice sites in the flanking intron.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Several large scale screens of insertion mutations in
        mouse embryo-derived stem (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>) cells rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence
        analysis to select mutations for germline transmission [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . The process, designated "tagged sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutagenesis</ENAMEX>", involves sequencing short segments of DNA
        isolated from each mutation to identify genes disrupted by
        the targeting vector. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sequence</ENAMEX>-based screens are faster and
        less expensive than phenotype-based screens, and provide
        centralised collections of characterised mutations
        available for germline transmission. However, to maximise
        the utility of tagged sequence mutagenesis, one would like
        to predict, from the sequence alone, the functional
        consequences of the inserted targeting vector on cellular
        gene expression. Toward this end, the present study
        characterised a mutation generated by insertion of the
        U3Neo gene trap retrovirus into an intron of the hnRNP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene. Expression of the Neo gene involved splicing of
        some hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> transcripts to a cryptic splice acceptor
        site located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 nucleotides</NUMEX> downstream of the neomycin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphotransferase</ENAMEX> (NTP) initiation codon. Other hnRNP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> transcripts splice normally, removing the provirus
        along with other intron sequences. Therefore, expression of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNPA2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene was only reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of wild
        type levels, and the mutation caused no obvious phenotype
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        U3 gene trap vectors were designed to disrupt cellular
        gene function by usurping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the occupied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and by ablating transcription downstream of the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>) carried by the provirus.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">poly</TIMEX>(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are not usually recognised when located
        in introns [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39 40</NUMEX> ] , U3 gene traps were expected to
        select for clones in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provirus</ENAMEX> had inserted into
        exons of transcriptionally active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. However, in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the targeted genes we have analysed [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] , the provirus has inserted into introns.
        The present study identified a mechanism that allows
        expression of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U3Neo</NUMEX> gene from a provirus positioned
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an intron.</TIMEX> The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1</ENAMEX>-Neo fusion
        transcripts utilised a cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPT</ENAMEX> coding sequence. This places the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' proviral poly(A)
        site at the end of an alternative exon that can be utilised
        to produce fusion transcripts, or excluded to produce wild
        type transcripts. Since the initiation codon for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPT</ENAMEX> lies
        upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTP</ENAMEX> is expressed as a
        fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">219</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of hnRNP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> are appended to codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTP</ENAMEX>.
        Because of these results, we have analyzed the
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> other U3Neo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proviruses</ENAMEX> located in the
        introns of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Transcripts in all but one of
        clone splice to the cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> splice site; while the one
        exception utilizes a cryptic splice site located in the
        proximal intron (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. White</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Hicks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Roshon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. E.</ENAMEX>
        Ruley, in preparation). Thus, utilization of the Neo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptic</ENAMEX> site appears to provide the predominant mechanism
        by which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">U3Neo</NUMEX> gene is expressed following insertion
        into introns.
        These results are consistent with an exon definition
        model in which splicing and polyadenylation require
        interactions between factors acting across exons [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ]
        . This model predicts that polyadenylation signals are not
        recognised unless they can be defined as part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>'
        terminal exon. Accordingly, poly(A) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are not
        efficiently recognised when positioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 5</TIMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        splice sites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] , and insertion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5</TIMEX>' splice site
        into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3</TIMEX>' terminal exon suppresses polyadenylation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 42</NUMEX>
        ] . Conversely, upstream <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' splice sites can enhance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyadenylation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45</NUMEX> ] . We find that the proximal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1 exon</ENAMEX> upstream of the provirus does not lose its
        identity; rather, the exon splices either to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> splice
        site or to the next hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1 exon.</ENAMEX> Moreover, the poly(A)
        site in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> appears to be used exclusively in
        conjunction with a cryptic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site.
        Utilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site is likely to have
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important consequences with regard to the use of U3Neo
        vectors for insertional mutagenesis. First, insertion into
        an intron may not disrupt cellular gene expression. In the
        present study, levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNP A2/B1</ENAMEX> transcripts were
        reduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about two</NUMEX> fold in homozygous mutant cells, and
        the relative amount of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2/B1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in hnRNP complexes
        was unaffected (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Dreyfuss</ENAMEX>, personal communication). This
        may explain the absence of an obvious phenotype in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Alternatively, other hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> compensate for reduced
        levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/B1</ENAMEX> transcripts, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> can tolerate
        severe reductions in the levels of the related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hnRNP</ENAMEX> A1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site is downstream of
        the NPT initiation codon, its use may skew the targeting to
        favor of those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> capable of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">splicing</NUMEX> upstream exons
        in-frame, to produce enzymatically active fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        The magnitude of the potential bias is difficult to assess.
        A variety of amino-terminal fusions maintain enzymatic
        activity (or produce enzymatically active breakdown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">products</ENAMEX>) including those fused to codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPT</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 51 52</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, selection of resistant cell clones
        requires only minimal levels of Neo gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ]
        . Still, genes providing the appropriate introns are
        expected to provide larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for gene trap
        mutagenesis than genes lacking such introns. This could
        contribute to the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> inserts characterised
        in an earlier study occurred in the same intron of the L29
        gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice site contains a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, and the sequence (CAGG) across the intron-exon
        boundary is optimal according to the scanning model of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splice</ENAMEX> site selection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo</ENAMEX> site differs from
        the typical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' splice site in that it lacks a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypyrimidine</ENAMEX> tract; however, this feature is often
        missing from alternative splice sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point and the intron-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> dinucleotide
        are considered invariant; therefore, one may be able to
        enhance the mutagenic efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U3Neo</ENAMEX> vectors by
        altering these nucleotides. Alternatively, the problem may
        be avoided by using other selectable markers, assuming
        their sequences lack cryptic splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or by using gene
        trap vectors that rely on splicing to activate the
        expression of genes carried by the targeting vector. The
        latter vectors contain strong splice sites, either in front
        of [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 4</NUMEX> ] or behind [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] the entrapment cassette,
        allowing efficient expression from within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">introns</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hnRNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> and hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">B1</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA binding proteins</ENAMEX> found associated with mammalian
        heterogeneous nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are thought to
        participate in the processing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA precursors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , and
        they can influence splice site selection and promote exon
        skipping in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58 59</NUMEX> ] . Consistent with a
        fundamental role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA metabolism</ENAMEX>, the human and mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hnRNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are highly conserved with only one amino
        acid difference out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. However, since the 1B4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> did not ablate hnRNP <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene expression, it is
        unlikely to be useful for studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hnRNPA2/</ENAMEX>B1 gene
        function. While further analysis might uncover phenotypes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this hypomorphic mutation, detailed
        examination of either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> seemed unjustified in
        the absence of any greater effect on gene expression. Our
        results illustrate the interplay between polyadenylation
        and splicing as predicted by an exon definition model.
        Moreover, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1B4</TIMEX> mutation reveals a mechanism by which U3
        gene trap vectors can be expressed without disrupting
        cellular gene expression and suggests ways to improve the
        vectors for gene trap mutagenesis.
