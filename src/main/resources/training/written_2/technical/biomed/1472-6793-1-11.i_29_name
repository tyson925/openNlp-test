        Low intestinal calcium absorption efficiency in humans
        is common and contributes to negative calcium balance and
        bone loss [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Recent epidemiological evidence suggests
        that low fractional calcium absorption is a significant
        risk factor for future osteoporotic hip fracture [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The primary homeostatic mechanism for altering calcium
        absorption in response to low dietary calcium intake and
        increased calcium requirements during growth is an increase
        in plasma <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active hormonal form
        of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> produced in the kidney [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> is a seco-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> that acts on gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> through a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid receptor protein</ENAMEX>
        and also may have nongenomic actions mediated by a putative
        plasma membrane vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> receptor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Changes in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vitamin</TIMEX> D status primarily alter the rate of Ca absorption
        in the proximal small intestine. During transcellular
        calcium transport across the absorptive enterocyte, calcium
        must pass across an apical brush border <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane</ENAMEX>, then
        transverse the interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> against an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrochemical</ENAMEX> gradient across the basolateral membrane.
        Changes in the rate of vectorial Ca transport in the
        intestine however must be accomplished without a major
        disruption in the free intracellular Ca concentration,
        which is used as an important intracellular signal in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterocyte</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] as in other cells.
        It has been known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 30 years</TIMEX> that vitamin D
        status influences the level of calbindin D, a cytosolic
        calcium-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] believed to be the
        rate-limiting step in calcium absorption [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] by acting as
        an intracellular calcium ferry or chaperone. Calcium
        extrusion at the basolateral membrane is an active process
        involving a Ca-ATPase that may also be affected by vitamin
        D status [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, although it has been known for
        more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> that the rate of Ca transport across the
        intestinal brush border <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane</ENAMEX> can be increased by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , the identity of the calcium
        transport protein involved in Ca influx has not been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascertained</ENAMEX>. Recently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novel, closely related,
        epithelial calcium channels, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ECaC2</ENAMEX>) and
        ECaC1 (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT2</ENAMEX>), have been cloned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] and rabbit [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] respectively and shown to mediate
        calcium influx when expressed in 
        Xenopus oocytes. CaT1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ECaC1</ENAMEX> are
        found in several tissues, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin
        D-responsive epithelia in the intestine and kidney. These
        epithelial calcium channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are products of
        evolutionary local gene duplication found on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        and represent a new family of Ca-selective ion channels
        involved in active Ca (re)absorption [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore,
        it has been suggested that the control of the number of
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> at the cell surface is critical for
        regulation of active calcium transport and that the
        epithelial calcium channel could confer the rate-limiting
        step in transcellular calcium transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and other cell surface-acting signal
        molecules trigger increases in the concentration of calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ions</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> by release of calcium from stores
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, or activation of Ca ++<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> in the
        plasma membrane allowing calcium to enter from outside the
        cell. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most common mechanisms that regulate entry
        of calcium is by capacitative or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>-operated calcium
        entry [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The epithelial Ca-release activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>,
        I 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRAC</ENAMEX> , is a highly calcium-selective
        plasma membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channel</ENAMEX> that is activated on lowering
        of either intracellular calcium concentration or
        intracellular calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CaT1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> has been
        recently expressed in mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CHO cells</ENAMEX> and patch clamp
        studies have shown it to have the characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRAC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Nearly ubiquitous,
        store-operated calcium entry is essential in a wide variety
        of cellular processes including muscle contraction, protein
        secretion, metabolism, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX>, cell division
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Intestinal calcium absorption is increased after feeding
        a low calcium diet or under conditions of increased calcium
        needs, such as during growth, via a parathyroid hormone
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTH</ENAMEX>)-vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> mediated process [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . A lowering of
        serum calcium levels stimulates the secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTH</ENAMEX> that
        then activates the renal conversion of inactive
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>-hydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> to the active hormonal metabolite
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> At the intestine,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D, acting through a nuclear receptor,
        stimulates transcription of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
        including calbindin D, involved in calcium transport
        thereby acting as the primary hormonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of active
        intestinal calcium transport [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . It is thus likely that
        any putative key molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in calcium absorption,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ECaC1</TIMEX>, should be a prime target for
        hormonal regulation by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> However, to
        date, neither CaT1 nor ECaC1 expression has been shown to
        be related to serum <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> or vitamin D
        status [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 16</NUMEX> ] .
        We have developed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] a unique human
        intestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture model of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-mediated
        transepithelial Ca transport using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells, a colon
        adenocarcinoma cell line. This cell line spontaneously
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiates</ENAMEX> in culture and expresses biochemical and
        morphological characteristics of well-differentiated small
        intestine-like enterocytes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 23</NUMEX> ] . We have previously
        shown that Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells possess a classical nuclear vitamin
        D <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] that directly mediates vitamin
        D-dependent gene expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and exhibits a high
        degree of specificity for various vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> metabolites and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analogs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Most importantly, in response to
        short-term (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><24</NUMEX> h) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment,
        Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells increase transepithelial calcium transport [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] and calbindin D 
        9K expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , a cytosolic
        calcium binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Kinetic analysis of Ca transport
        across <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caco-2</ENAMEX> monolayers grown on permeable filter supports
        indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment increased
        the V 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> of Ca transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , which would
        be consistent with a vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-dependent increase in the
        number of calcium transporters.
        In the current paper, we have used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caco-2</ENAMEX> cell
        culture model to demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> expressed in the human enterocyte compared
        to ECaC1, and for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time demonstrate that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment can cause a rapid and
        marked increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA expression in the enterocyte.
        These observations suggest a likely important role for this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calcium</ENAMEX> transporter in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vitamin</TIMEX> D-dependent calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          CaT1 is expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells
          We initially addressed the question of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caco</ENAMEX>-2
          cells express ECaC1 or the closely related CaT1 gene.
          This is important because it has been suggested that
          because of the high degree of sequence similarity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>)
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the CaT1</TIMEX> and ECaC1 genes care should be taken in
          interpreting data obtained by hybridization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> or other
          methodologies based on nucleotide sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> derived from the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ECaC1</ENAMEX> or
          CaT1 gene was purified and sequenced. Based on new
          sequence information (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number AF304464
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ECaC1</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF365927</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CaT1</NUMEX>), [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ) the nucleotides
          determined following the sequencing of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caco-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was an identical match for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> rather
          than ECaC1 (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the sequences of the
          coding region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CaT1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ECaC1 genes</ENAMEX> (GenBank
          AF365927 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF304464</ENAMEX>) indicate that an additional
          identification step based on restriction fragment length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> (RFLP) analysis could also be used to
          confirm the identity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CaT1</NUMEX> mRNA in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. As
          described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Method</ENAMEX> section, a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">259 bp PCR</ENAMEX> product was
          generated with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers that would
          specifically encompass a differential 
          Bgl1 restriction enzyme cut site
          present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ECaC1</TIMEX>. Prior to electrophoresis
          on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agarose gel, the amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was either
          left untreated, or treated with 
          Bgl1 or 
          BssHII restriction enzymes. There
          is no predicted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BssHII</ENAMEX> cut site in our amplified
          region of either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ECaC1</ENAMEX> based on the recently
          published sequence of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank</ENAMEX> AF365927
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF304464</ENAMEX>). Thus, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BssHII</ENAMEX> should serve as negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for the restriction enzyme digestion step. In
          contrast, the location of the single 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BglI</ENAMEX> cut site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> should result
          in the generation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bands (â‰… 180 bp</ENAMEX> and â‰… <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) if the amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX>. Since ECaC1
          does not have a predicted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BglI</ENAMEX> site in the amplified PCR
          product, no smaller bands should result if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ECaC1</ENAMEX> was
          being amplified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction. As shown in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, we found that there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller bands of the
          predicted size and no larger <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">259</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bp band</ENAMEX> remaining after 
          Bgl1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">digestion</ENAMEX>, confirming the
          identity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> as the product being amplified in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-2
          cell. In addition, 
          BssHII restriction enzyme digestion
          did not result in smaller bands, consistent with a likely
          specific action of 
          Bgl1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">digestion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CaT1</ENAMEX> under the
          digestion conditions used. In addition, further attempts
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caco-2</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> with other PCR
          primers designed to specifically amplify ECaC1 did not
          result in an amplified product under our conditions (data
          not shown). Thus, based on this collective information,
          we conclude that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX>, but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ECaC1</TIMEX>, is expressed in
          Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. It needs to be pointed out, however, that
          since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells are not derived from normal human
          intestinal tissue, it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ECaC1</ENAMEX> could be
          expressed in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intestine</ENAMEX>. However, our
          observation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells is consistent with the recent
          report by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] indicating a high
          expression level of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CaT1/ECaC2</ENAMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intestine</ENAMEX> based
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Northern blotting</ENAMEX>, and similar findings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peng et</ENAMEX> al.
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] using quantitative real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX>, who
          also noted the apparent absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ECaC1/CaT2</ENAMEX> in human
          intestinal tissue.
        
        
          CaT1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> is regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin
          D
          Having established the identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CaT1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-2
          cells, we then studied the effect of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA
          expression. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> is an important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of
          intestinal calcium absorption, it is likely that it would
          be regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, treatment of cells for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -7mol<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/L</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D caused a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> studies) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA expression. To
          our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstration in either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">experimental animals</ENAMEX> or human tissue that intestinal CaT1
          expression is up regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D.
          This finding may provide an important molecular key to
          understand the mechanism of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-mediated intestinal
          calcium absorption. Moreover, given the potentially
          central role of this epithelial calcium channel as an
          important modulator of cellular calcium influx in a
          variety of cell types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , it will be of interest to
          investigate whether the vitamin D effect on CaT1
          expression extends beyond the enterocyte. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Vitamin</TIMEX> D
          status is known to influence a wide range of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> systems including cells involved in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> system, endocrine function, prostate, skin and
          muscle. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Vitamin</TIMEX> D effects on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> expression and cellular
          calcium influx could thereby theoretically modulate
          intracellular calcium and cell signaling in a variety of
          different tissues providing insight into understanding
          the physiological effects of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> throughout the
          body. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] have reported that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">androgen influences CaT1</ENAMEX> mRNA expression
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNCaP</ENAMEX> prostate cells. We have not yet evaluated the
          effects of androgens on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells.
          However, we have found (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Taparia</ENAMEX>, unpublished studies)
          that all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormones</ENAMEX> do not share this effect on
          CaT1 expression because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-Î² estradiol (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-7mol/L</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>) had no effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells.
          In any case, the demonstrated effect of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA shown here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-2
          cells is consistent with the idea that the active
          metabolite of vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> could increase the number of CaT1
          calcium transporters in the plasma membrane and could
          therefore be responsible for the higher rates of calcium
          influx seen across the brush border membrane in vitamin
          D-replete <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 27</ENAMEX> ] thereby playing a key
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gatekeeper</ENAMEX> role in increasing the efficiency of
          intestinal calcium absorption and maintaining calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> causes a rapid and marked
          up regulation of CaT1 expression
          In another series of studies, we addressed the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporal</ENAMEX> and dose-response effect of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-2
          cells. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the response of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> is rapid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> studies).
          Treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-7mol/L</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D
          increased (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2</NUMEX>-fold) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX>, the earliest time
          point investigated, and clearly elevated CaT1 expression
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX>, with progressively higher expression
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 14-fold</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the later time</TIMEX> points.
          The relationship between the dose of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> mRNA response
          was investigated in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> set (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> studies) of
          experiments at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -9</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -8</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -7mol<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/L</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h. In these studies there
          was a significant increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA levels at the
          lowest dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -9mol<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/L</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D
          studied (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), while a slightly higher level of CaT1
          mRNA expression was observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -8mol<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/L</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D, no further effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA
          was seen with another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold increase in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration.
          The rapid time course of induction and sensitivity of
          CaT1 mRNA response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment
          supports the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> could play a role as a
          gatekeeper of intestinal calcium absorption. We have
          previously reported that it takes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-16</NUMEX> h following
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells to
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appreciate an increase in saturable transcellular
          calcium transport [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . This temporal response is
          similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-16</ENAMEX> h observed for the achievement of
          maximal rates of intestinal calcium absorption in vivo
          following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of vitamin
          D-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Future studies of the time
          course of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CaT1 protein</ENAMEX> expression and localization of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the brush border will be necessary to
          confirm this point, but must await the development of a
          suitable CaT1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          CaT1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> precedes the increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">calbindin</TIMEX> D
          9kmRNA expression
          It has been argued [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] that the cytosolic vitamin
          D-dependent calcium binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein calbindin</ENAMEX> D 
          9K is the likely rate-limiting step in
          vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-induced intestinal calcium absorption. However,
          despite a considerable amount of associative evidence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          ] , there has long been some controversy on this issue [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] because of apparent discrepancies in the
          temporal pattern of calbindin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D9k</ENAMEX> induction compared to
          calcium absorption following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D
          treatment in experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Thus, in the current
          study, to evaluate a possible gatekeeper role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> in
          vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-mediated calcium transport we compared the time
          course of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> induction of calbindin
          D9k <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells,
          the mRNA for both calbindin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> can be detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> in the absence of vitamin D treatment. The
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> in the basal
          cell culture medium is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX> -12mol<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">/L. As</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the time course of vitamin
          D-dependent mRNA induction of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> clearly
          differs with CaT1 expression responding much earlier than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calbindin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D9k</ENAMEX>. There is no evident induction of calbindin
          D mRNA by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> post treatment. In these experiments calbindin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> mRNA
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold greater than control by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX> In contrast,
          CaT1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was clearly increased (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>5</NUMEX>-fold) by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h post
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment in the same cells.
          These observations will need to be expanded in the future
          to include measurement of the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However,
          such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies will not completely settle the
          question of the relative importance of either of these
          vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-induced genes in the calcium transport response
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> Those questions will be
          likely answered more directly in the future by
          individually altering the expression of these calcium
          transport genes in transfected cell lines or in
          transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models.
          Given what is already known about the characteristics
          of the epithelial calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and calbindin D, it is
          a plausible hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> and calbindin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> could
          work in tandem to maintain high rates of calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX>. Studies in human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">duodenal biopsy</ENAMEX> specimens
          have found a significant correlation between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> mRNA
          and calbindin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> mRNA expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Thus, as a
          working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX>, we propose that during times of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dietary calcium stress</ENAMEX>, or during periods of high calcium
          demand, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> expression in the enterocyte is increased by
          a vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-dependent mechanism. This regulatory genomic
          response of the enterocyte would result in an increase in
          the brush border <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane</ENAMEX> content of CaT1 calcium influx
          channels that could function as a gatekeeper mechanism to
          augment the rate of calcium entry across the apical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . However, given that there is a
          Ca-dependent negative feedback mechanism to limit calcium
          entry through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> by maintaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> in
          the closed position [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] there must be a way to
          remove calcium from the vicinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytosolic</ENAMEX> face of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> to optimize and sustain calcium influx rates.
          The coordinated vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-dependent induction of the
          cytosolic calcium-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> calbindin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> could serve
          this function when the need for transcellular calcium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flux</ENAMEX> is high by acting directly or indirectly as a
          molecular sponge and selectively removing calcium ions
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CaT1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and/or to buffer increases in
          intracellular calcium, thereby preventing premature
          inactivation of this I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Calbindin</TIMEX> D
          could also play its traditionally conceived role as a
          calcium chaperone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to facilitate the transfer of
          calcium through the cytosol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and perhaps delivery
          of Ca ++to the basolateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent calcium pump for
          extrusion out of the enterocyte [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        These observations are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to demonstrate
        regulation of CaT1 expression by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enterocyte</ENAMEX> and are consistent with a new model of
        intestinal calcium absorption wherein vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-mediated
        changes in brush border <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane CaT1</ENAMEX> levels could be the
        primary gatekeeper regulating homeostatic modulation of
        intestinal calcium absorption efficiency.

          electrophoresed on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agarose gel containing ethidium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bromide</ENAMEX>. Relative amounts of amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product from
          each experimental condition were visualized under
          ultraviolet light and digitized with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gel Doc 2000</ENAMEX> gel
          documentation system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>,
          CA). Relative amounts of product were estimated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> densitometry using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantity One</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>)
          quantitation software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>). CaT1 and calbindin D 
          9K mRNA expression were normalized
          relative to the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> mRNA, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constitutively</ENAMEX> expressed gene whose levels were not
          affected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,25</NUMEX>-dihydroxyvitamin D treatment.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequencing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX> analysis to establish the
          identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CaT1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-2 Cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products from the epithelial calcium channel were
          generated with the primers described above, subjected to
          electrophoresis on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> low-melting-point agarose gel,
          and purified for sequence verification. The DNA
          sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tufts University</ENAMEX> sequenced the PCR
          product to identify whether the amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caco-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaT1</ENAMEX> or the closely related
          ECaC1 sequence. Because of the high nucleotide similarity
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1 and ECaC1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>), an additional identification
          step based on restriction fragment length polymorphism
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFLP</ENAMEX>) analysis was also conducted to confirm the
          identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CaT1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caco</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were
          generated using the following primer set: sense primer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>'TGACATCTGAGCTCTATGAGGGT3', <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GenBank</ENAMEX> AF365927
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nucleotides 545-567</ENAMEX>) and antisense primer
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'CCCAGGGAGTCCTGGGCCCGGA3' (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nucleotides 782-803</ENAMEX>). These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> yield a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">259 bp PCR</ENAMEX> product with a specific
          restriction site that makes it possible to clearly
          distinguish between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaT1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ECaC1</ENAMEX> using the restriction
          enzymes 
          Bgl1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs</ENAMEX>). In this
          PCR amplified product, there is no predicted 
          Bgl1 restriction enzyme site in the
          corresponding ECaC1 sequence. In contrast, the presence
          of this 
          Bgl1 cut site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CaT1</TIMEX> sequence
          will result in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller bands (â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‰… 180 and â‰… 80 bp</NUMEX>)
          after digestion with the endonuclease. The endonuclease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">digested</ENAMEX> and undigested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCR samples</ENAMEX> were electrophoresed
          on a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> agarose gel and the bands were visualized with
          ethidium bromide staining. The size of the cut bands was
          estimated with standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> pb markers to identify whether
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product amplified from Caco-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells was being cut
          into the appropriately sized bands with 
          Bgl1 .

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are reported as mean Â± the standard error of the
          mean (SEM). Experiments were repeated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 10</NUMEX> times.
          Treatment effects were evaluated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> with a post hoc
          Tukey test for individual treatment comparisons (SYSTAT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">version 9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cary NC</ENAMEX>) where applicable.
