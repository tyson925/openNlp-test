        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibromyalgia syndrome</ENAMEX> (FMS) is characterized by wide
        spread pain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, associated with particular tender
        points [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . It is often accompanied by unrestorative
        sleep patterns, fatigue, headaches, irritable bowel and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bladder syndrome</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> stiffness, paresthesias, anxiety,
        and depression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . The prevalence rate is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2%</NUMEX> in
        the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-40</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.8%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-60</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 8%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ages
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55-64</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> is more prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a 3</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> who suffer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> have a
        disability index comparable to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] while disease severity was worse
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sjogren's syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The natural course of FMS
        may include some symptomatic relief [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , but many
        symptoms remain essentially unchanged after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 years</TIMEX> of
        follow up [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Treatments for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (amitriptyline
        and fluoxetine most common), nutritional supplements (malic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">s</ENAMEX>-adenosyl methionine, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-hydroxytryptophan</NUMEX>), and
        physical therapies (cardiovascular training, stretching,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electroacupuncture</ENAMEX>), and cognitive-behavior therapy
        [reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] ]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> frequently use
        alternative therapies, indicating dissatisfaction, or
        ineffectiveness of traditional medical therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> engulfs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in a downward spiral of
        unrestorative sleep, chronic pain, fatigue, inactivity, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>. Each symptom reinforces the others, making it
        difficult to break out of the cycle. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-week</TIMEX> vegetarian
        diet improved subjective well being in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, along
        with significant reductions in serum peroxides, plasma
        fibrinogen, apolipoproteins A and B, and serum total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . A "living-foods" vegan diet was used
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3-month</TIMEX> non-randomized controlled study of FMS
        subjects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . In the intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> there were
        significant improvements in pain scores, quality of sleep,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning stiffness</TIMEX>, health assessment questionnaire scores,
        and general health questionnaire. These studies, along with
        anecdotal evidence that we have gathered, indicate that a
        mostly raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> vegetarian diet is helpful in breaking the
        cycle of suffering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        In this study we utilized a pure vegetarian diet
        composed mostly of common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, nuts, tubers,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot juice</ENAMEX>, and dehydrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley grass juice</ENAMEX> while
        tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">FMS</ENAMEX> status during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 7-month</TIMEX> period
        of time.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Subjects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were recruited from a local fibromyalgia
          support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, by notice of the study in a bi-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX>
          newsletter, and by word of mouth. An informed consent
          document explaining the study and the risks and benefits
          of participation was given to each potential subject.
          Written consent was obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> before
          participation. The study was conducted in accord with the
          ethical standards of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Helsinki Declaration of 1975</ENAMEX> as
          revised in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were required to have a previous diagnosis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> by a rheumatologist, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of</ENAMEX>
          Rheumatology criteria of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 11</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> tender points
          being painful upon palpation. Subjects underwent a
          physical examination upon entering the study, including
          the tender point survey.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were encouraged to continue with any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> for sleep or pain. It was believed that this
          would allow the best comparison between initial and final
          conditions, with as few variables changing as possible.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> and their prescribing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> made all
          medication decisions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in this study had
          no control of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> usage.
        
        
          Diet implementation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were supplied with books published by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallelujah Acres, Inc.</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God's Way</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimate Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recipes</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>...from God's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Garden</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 Days</TIMEX> to health the
          Hallelujah diet way ) and informational pamphlets.
          Instructions were given on what <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> to eat (fresh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fruits</ENAMEX>, salads, raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot juice</ENAMEX>, nuts,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>, whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain products</ENAMEX>, tubers, flax <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed oil</ENAMEX>, extra
          virgin olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>) what <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> to avoid (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, caffeine,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> containing refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syrup</ENAMEX>, refined
          and/or hydrogenated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flour</ENAMEX>, dairy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, and
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>) and how to prepare freshly extracted carrot
          juice with the supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champion</ENAMEX> juicer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plastaket Mfg.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co. Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lodi</ENAMEX>, CA). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were given a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-month</TIMEX> supply
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dehydrated barley grass juice powder</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barleygreen</ENAMEX>) and
          a blend of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">laxative herbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">psyllium seed</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herbal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiberblend</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM International</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nampa, ID</ENAMEX>), with
          instruction to ask for more when this supply was
          finished. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were encouraged to attend a live
          motivational presentation of the basis of the Hallelujah
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet</ENAMEX> to reorient their thinking about food and health. A
          video was available for those subjects that did not
          attend the presentation. No regular support meetings were
          scheduled for motivational encouragement after this
          initial presentation, as this might make the results less
          applicable to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Main outcome measures
          Physical performance measures, as detailed by
          Mannerkorpi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , were collected at the
          beginning and end of the study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> measures were used.
          These were shoulder pain at rest, range of active motion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abduction</ENAMEX> and flexion, shoulder pain on motion, hand to
          neck, hand to scapula, isometric shoulder endurance, neck
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rotation</ENAMEX>, hand grip strength, flexibility of the low back
          and hamstrings using the sit-and-reach method, chair test
          (number of times a subject could stand up in a minute),
          and a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six-minute</TIMEX> walk. All of these measures were taken
          by the same physical therapist (SL). Along with these
          objective tests, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were asked to report their
          health status using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> short form health survey [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , and
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality of Life Survey</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 has been
          widely used to record how a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> perceives his or her
          own health status. The quality of life survey queries the
          subject <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 16</NUMEX> different aspects of life with a scale
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 0 to 7</TIMEX> for each question. These questionnaires were
          self-administered at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 2, 4</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX>.
          A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), designed to
          include commonly eaten <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> while following the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallelujah Diet</ENAMEX>, was also self-administered at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 4</ENAMEX>, and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX>. The FFQ administered at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX> was analyzed
          using The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Processor</ENAMEX>, version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.40</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESHA Research</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>, OR).
        
        
          Statistics
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QOL</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> surveys were analyzed by
          repeated measures analysis of variance. Differences
          between time points were calculated using the Bonferroni
          comparison. A subgroup of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> was used
          that reported in the beginning, end, and either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> into the trial. The physical performance measures
          were analyzed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s paired t-test. 18 subjects
          gave initial and final physical performance measures. A
          significance level less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was considered
          statistically significant.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Responders</ENAMEX> and non-responders were initially
          distinguished using the FIQ score. If a subject reported
          at least a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-point improvement in their initial and
          final FIQ score, then that subject was classified as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responder</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-point improvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> correlated
          with statistically significant improvements in measures
          of physical performance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QOLS</ENAMEX> scores, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          scores.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Subjects
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> participated in this study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> female, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          male. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had been previously diagnosed with
          fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist, but not all subjects
          currently had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> or more positive tender points. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had symptoms which they attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX>.
          Compliance of subjects was monitored by self-reported
          food intakes on a food frequency questionnaire, and by
          requests for more dehydrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley grass juice</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-month</TIMEX> supply was initially given to
          each subject, with instructions to call and ask for more
          when their supply ran out.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of whom are classified as responders)
          returned surveys at the beginning, end, and either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. Detailed results for the self-reported
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">questionnaires</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QOLS</ENAMEX>) here are reported for
          this subgroup. Response (responder or non-responder) to
          the dietary intervention is reported based on all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          subjects according to the intention to treat principle.
          Analysis shows there were no significant differences in
          gathered data between the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-group</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Dietary intake
          Food frequency questionnaires were collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Nutrient intakes, based on the FFQ
          administered at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX>, are reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Diet
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">percentages</ENAMEX>, on an energy basis, were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX> fat, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>
          percent carbohydrate, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 percent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> reported drinking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 240</NUMEX> ml servings of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot juice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, so that the mean intake of
          beta-carotene was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          reported less consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carrot juice</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> months
          than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX>. The dehydrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley grass juice</ENAMEX> was
          consumed by all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who reported immediate
          nausea upon consumption of the powder. Flax <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed oil</ENAMEX> was
          consumed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> so that the mean intake
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">n-3 fatty acids</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6</NUMEX> g/day. Fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and
          salads, based mostly on leaf <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> and dark leafy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">greens</ENAMEX> rather than head <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX>, were consumed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. The
          high intakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> resulted in high
          intakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>, vitamin C, folate, potassium, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magnesium</ENAMEX>. Animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> consumption was very low,
          especially intakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. Intakes
          were mainly from once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> to none, resulting in low
          intakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, vitamins <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B12</ENAMEX> and D, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>. Soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink intake</ENAMEX> was reported in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>,
          demonstrating willingness to report truthfully. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 3</NUMEX>
          subjects reported consuming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a 340</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> serving
          per week.
        
        
          Physical performance
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were followed up after completion of
          the study (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Results are only reported for
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of whom were classified as
          responders, Initial values were very similar to values
          reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mannerkorpi et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Significant
          improvements (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.03</ENAMEX>, paired t-test) in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were seen in shoulder pain at rest and after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motion</ENAMEX>, abduct range of motion of shoulder, flexibility
          (sit and reach), chair test, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6-minute</TIMEX> walk. Neck
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rotation</ENAMEX> (left only) was also significantly improved.
          Hand grip strength decreased significantly in right hand
          and decreased to a lesser extent in the left hand.
          Isometric shoulder endurance showed no change.
        
        
          FIQ
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> is a survey designed specifically to measure
          the impact of fibromyalgia on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s life. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> score had fallen from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> points to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          points and decreased further to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> points at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> at each time point). This is a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>
          improvement after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> improvement after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. The histogram in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1of</NUMEX> the FIQ score shows a
          decrease in the scores as the trial progressed.
          There was a significant trend (all P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) for
          improvement in all scales (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). There were
          significant improvements (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> with Bonferroni
          correction) in all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> sub-scales from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-7 months</TIMEX>,
          and almost all of the sub-scales from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-2 months</TIMEX> ("work
          missed" and "days feeling good" being the exceptions)
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          QOL
          Quality of life improved during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 7-month</TIMEX> trial,
          with the composite score rising from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an initial 3.9</NUMEX> to
          4.7 at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> each time

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7</ENAMEX> being a delighted quality of life. There were
          significant differences between initial and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> month
          scores, and initial and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 month</TIMEX> scores, but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 month</TIMEX> scores (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> with Bonferroni
          correction). The biggest impact was seen in active
          recreation, health, socializing, and participation in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 health survey breaks down health into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sub-headings.</ENAMEX> These areas are physical functioning, role
          physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functioning</ENAMEX>, role emotional, and mental health (see Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> areas, bodily pain being the exception,
          showed significant improvement (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> each time point,
          all P for trend < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). There were significant
          differences for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> headings between initial and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          month scores, except for general health, and also between
          initial and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 month</TIMEX> scores, but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2 and 7</NUMEX> month
          scores (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05 with Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction).
          Norms for the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>'s responses to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 questionnaire have been published [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
          Initially, the mean score for all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 scales
          were significantly lower than the norms for women ages
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45-54</NUMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> of dietary intervention 4 scales
          were no longer significantly different from the norms,
          showing marked improvement (general health, vitality,
          role emotional, mental health) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Responders</ENAMEX> versus non-responders
          A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-point improvement in the FIQ score was used to
          distinguish responders from non-responders. 19 subjects
          were classified as responders, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> as non-responders, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> did not follow through on initial
          evaluations. Mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> score improvement for responders
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> points, with a range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 to 62</NUMEX> points. Mean
          FIQ score decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> points for non-responders,
          with a range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-14.6</NUMEX> points. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">responders</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX> for all scales except bodily
          pain were no longer statistically different from norms
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45-54</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Responders</ENAMEX> to the dietary
          intervention also had significant improvements in
          physical performance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> (data not shown),
          while non-responders had no significant change in their
          fibromyalgia status.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The connection between dietary and lifestyle habits with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic diseases</ENAMEX> has become increasingly strong in the past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>. Most of the research has been towards the
        prevention of chronic disease rather than toward its
        treatment.
        The natural course of fibromyalgia shows that symptoms
        are generally the same over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 7 years</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . A
        stable, sharp reduction in symptoms in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months</TIMEX>, as we
        have reported here, is a definite alteration of the natural
        history of fibromyalgia.
        Group treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibromyalgia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> using a
        multi-faceted approach resulted in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> improvement in
        overall FIQ score and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.2 cm</NUMEX> increase in sit and reach
        flexibility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . This study resulted in even greater
        improvements with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX> improvement in overall FIQ score
        and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.1 cm</NUMEX> increase in sit-and-reach flexibility. A
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-week</TIMEX> exercise and education program produced a total
        drop in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> subscales of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> points [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] ; these same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subscales</ENAMEX> in this study decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.9</NUMEX> points after the
        dietary intervention reported here. This comparison shows
        that education and exercise are not as an effective
        intervention as this dietary intervention.
        As mentioned, vegetarian dietary intervention of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibromyalgia</ENAMEX> has been tested by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. In a
        small study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hostmark et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] found a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-week vegetarian</TIMEX> diet produced an improvement in
        subjective well-being. Increase in well-being, as seen in
        the improvement in quality of life, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 scores,
        was also seen in our study. In a recent study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaartinen et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] used a strict "living-foods" pure vegetarian diet
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-month</TIMEX> non-randomized, controlled study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> saw significant improvements in pain scores
        and significantly less morning stiffness, similar to our
        results. Apparently the diet was difficult to implement and
        no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> continued with the "living-foods" diet.
        Symptoms returned upon reverting back to a more standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diet</ENAMEX>, showing even more clearly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of diet and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX>. Maintenance of diets requiring more food preparation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and uncommon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> is difficult. Since the diet used
        here is mainly based on common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> the long-term
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> to the program is likely to be higher. Subjects
        learned which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> caused them the most symptoms so that
        they avoided these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> on a long-term basis.
        Initial scores using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 health survey, compared
        to population norms, were very similar to those reported
        elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . This indicates that our fibromyalgia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were very similar to other surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in
        terms of their health status. Initial FIQ scores are also
        in line with other studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 months</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        subjects that responded to the diet were no longer
        statistically different from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45-54</TIMEX>, except for bodily pain. This indicates a
        remarkable recovery of function in a short period of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        Self-reported pain was significantly reduced as measured
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> and by the physical performance measurements,
        but not as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 questionnaire. Both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIQ</ENAMEX> and physical performance measure used a visual analog
        scale from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0-10</NUMEX> to measure pain, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 only
        used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> questions with a total range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> points to measure
        bodily pain. This may have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> a less sensitive
        measure of bodily pain than the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures.
        It was unclear whether or not closer adherence to the
        diet by the non-responders would have resulted in better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. Without rapid improvements a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> lost
        motivation and adhered less to the diet, while others saw
        positive results <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a couple of weeks</TIMEX>, thus encouraging
        them to continue faithfully. The basis for not responding
        to the diet may have been physiological rather than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motivational</ENAMEX>. Further research will help answer this
        question.
        What caused the significant improvements seen in this
        intervention study? There is likely a synergy of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> and psychological factors. The change in diet
        gave the subjects motivation to take control of their
        symptoms, to overcome their disabilities and inactivity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> that believed that a change in their diet would
        improve their symptoms were attracted to this study. The
        effect of expecting a positive result was not measured, but
        it certainly was beneficial to the subjects.
        Some aspects of the new diet also improve fatigue and
        sleep patterns, so that overwhelming fatigue did not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squelch subjects</ENAMEX>' newfound motivation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> could begin
        an upward cycle out of their FMS symptoms, rather
        continuing the downward trend toward further disability,
        chronic pain, and depression.
        Intakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>, several vitamins,
        including the antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E, and
        beta-carotene, and minerals (especially magnesium,
        potassium, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>) are significantly different from the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>'s dietary intake (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), so it is
        difficult to single out which factors were most important
        in producing the dramatic improvements seen in this study.
        The improvement is likely the synergistic result of several
        factors. It is unlikely that a single factor or a dietary
        supplement will be able to reproduce the results generated
        by an overall dietary change.
        Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> used in this study has not been validated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rigorously</ENAMEX>, a comparison to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-day</TIMEX> semi-quantitative dietary
        intake of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> following the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallelujah Diet</ENAMEX>
        (unpublished data) showed that, on an energy basis, the
        only significant differences between nutrient intakes
        reported here and in that survey were for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> and vitamin
        A. So, it appears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFQ</ENAMEX> captured nutrient intakes
        satisfactorily.
        Our study had several limitations. First, because all of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> did not currently meet the diagnosis criteria
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX>, the results cannot be compared directly with other
        studies. It's possible, but cannot be proven here, that
        greater improvement would have been seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
        were experiencing more pain. It's also possible that
        subjects with less severe pain were able to improve
        quicker. Equal percentages of subjects with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 11</NUMEX>
        painful tender points were found among responders and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-responders.</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, as an unblinded observational study there was no
        direct comparison with a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Many historical
        controls were available and the natural, chronic course of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX> is well described. However, the results would certainly
        be stronger if an active control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was included.
        Another limitation was the size of the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> here seemed to be representative of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMS</ENAMEX>, it is not certain that the same results
        would be seen in a large study. These results should be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reproduced</ENAMEX> and extended in a larger, controlled trial.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, a diet intervention using a mostly raw, pure
        vegetarian diet produced dramatic improvements in FMS
        symptoms. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> responded very favorably to
        the intervention, seeing marked improvement in all FMS
        symptoms. This dietary intervention shows that many
        fibromyalgia <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> can be helped even without
        understanding the full cause of their symptoms. Further
        controlled studies are needed to reproduce and extend the
        results obtained here to see if this dietary intervention
        is a viable adjunctive therapy for managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fibromyalgia</ENAMEX> in
        a clinical setting.
