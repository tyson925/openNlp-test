        The complications of bed rest have been known for nearly
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Routine care of mechanically ventilated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> typically involves a regimen of body position
        changes to aid in the prevention of skin breakdown, to
        enhance secretion clearance, and to improve ventilation/
        perfusion relationships [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. In the recent past,
        specialized beds have been introduced that automatically
        turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on a much more frequent basis independently
        of caregiver availability. Several clinical trials have
        suggested that this type of rotational or 'kinetic' therapy
        might reduce the incidence of hospital-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX>
        and reduce the duration of stay in an intensive care unit
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. Each of these studies can be
        criticized for design errors, and these specialized beds
        are not in routine use at present. Interestingly, little
        work has been performed to evaluate the physiological
        effects of rotational therapy. In fact, a recent paper was
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to evaluate gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> during short periods of
        rotation in comparison with the supine position [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        We designed a study to evaluate the acute physiological
        effects of rotational therapy in a group of critically ill,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paralyzed</ENAMEX>, mechanically ventilated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory distress syndrome</ENAMEX> (ARDS) over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
        period.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had previously been diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>,
          were chemically paralyzed, and were sedated. Paralysis
          was monitored with routine train-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> monitoring. ARDS
          was defined in accordance with the consensus definition
          of having a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen
          to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (P 
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FIO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 200</NUMEX>, bilateral
          infiltrates on the anterior-posterior chest radiograph,
          normal cardiac filling pressures (wedge pressure less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 mmHg</NUMEX>), and a causative factor. Chest radiographs
          were interpreted by the attending radiologist. Table
          1lists characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the study. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were ventilated with pressure-control
          ventilation. Positive end-expiratory pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEEP</ENAMEX>) was
          set to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen saturation</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 93%</NUMEX> and
          the tidal volume was set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 8 and 10</TIMEX> ml/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>. Tidal
          volume was reduced to maintain peak airway pressures of
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> cmH 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O. Respiratory</ENAMEX> rate was adjusted to
          maintain a pH of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 7.30</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inspiratory</ENAMEX> to
          expiratory time ratio was less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1.</TIMEX> Inspiratory time
          was set to increase mean airway pressure, to allow a
          period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> flow during inspiration, and to avoid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intrinsic PEEP</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study design
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were randomized to receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> turning and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> regimens in random sequence for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h
          each over a period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Sequence</ENAMEX> was determined by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX>-number table, varying the assignment of management
          regimens equally. These regimens included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) routine
          turning by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> staff <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every 2 h</NUMEX> from the left lateral

          Batesville, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) that turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from left
          to right lateral position, pausing at each position for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> with a specialized bed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Effica</ENAMEX>) that
          turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from left to right lateral position,
          pausing at each position for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 min</TIMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-min period
          of percussion provided by the pneumatic cushions of the
          bed every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. P&PD</ENAMEX> was done <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-90</NUMEX> min into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-h
          turn regimen.
        
        
          Measurements
          Routine cardiorespiratory monitoring was accomplished
          in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> protocol. Continuous monitoring of
          the electrocardiogram with lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, systolic, diastolic,
          and mean arterial blood pressures from indwelling radial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">catheters</ENAMEX>, and pulse oximetry were accomplished.
          Systolic, diastolic, and mean <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pulmonary artery</ENAMEX> pressures
          and central venous pressure were also monitored
          continuously. These variables were recorded <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> from
          cardiovascular monitors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sirecust; Siemens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Danvers</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
          All pressure monitoring systems were calibrated in
          accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s specifications and the
          zero reference was verified before data collection. Every
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 h</TIMEX>, measurements of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCWP</ENAMEX>) were made and cardiac output was determined from
          thermodilution curves with iced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saline</ENAMEX> in triplicate. At
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-h time point, arterial and pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> blood
          was drawn for measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX>, pH, and oxygen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX>. Samples were drawn, iced, and analyzed within
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> by using standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corning</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Medfield</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and co-oximeters (OSM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radiometer</ENAMEX>,
          Westlake, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). This time point was chosen to allow
          a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-h</NUMEX> period of rest after suctioning and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX>. All
          measurements were made with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in the supine
          position to prevent positional effects on the results.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were ventilated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>
          7200ae (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puritan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
          Airway pressures and tidal volume were recorded directly
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventilator</ENAMEX>'s digital display. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          ventilated by using pressure control ventilation.
          Pressure was limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 40</NUMEX> cmH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and tidal volume targets were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/kg.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intrinsic PEEP</ENAMEX> was measured with an expiratory
          pause of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> s and displayed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventilator</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intrinsic PEEP</ENAMEX> maneuver. Static pulmonary compliance was
          measured during the delivery of a volume-controlled,
          constant-flow breath by recording inspiratory plateau
          pressure after a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-s pause, total <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PEEP</ENAMEX> and exhaled
          tidal volume. Static compliance was calculated as static
          compliance (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/cmH</ENAMEX>

          total <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PEEP</ENAMEX>.
          Continuous measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption (VO

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> production (VCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), respiratory quotient (RQ), and
          resting energy expenditure (REE) were accomplished with
          an open-circuit indirect calorimeter with the use of the
          dilutional principle (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DeltaTrac' Sensormedics</ENAMEX>, Yorba
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>]. VO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , VCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RQ</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REE</ENAMEX> were averaged on a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute-to-minute</TIMEX> basis and saved to a personal computer
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> analysis. Mixed expired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) was also measured and used along
          with the partial pressure of arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (P

          Routine care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> continued to receive routine care including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bathing</ENAMEX>, mouth care, suctioning, and measurement of
          hourly vital signs. Every effort was made to maintain
          continuous rotation during the study period. No patient
          had received continuous rotation before the start of the
          study. Additionally, routine procedures were accomplished
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> h before blood gas data were obtained.
          Suctioning was accomplished as needed in the judgement of
          the nursing and respiratory therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Indications
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">suctioning</TIMEX> included rhonchi on auscultation, audible
          secretion noises, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> coughing, and the presence of a
          sawtooth pattern in the expiratory waveform in the
          absence of ventilator circuit condensate. A suctioning
          procedure was also accomplished following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">P&PD</ENAMEX>.
          Suctioning was done with a sterile, open-circuit
          technique with a single-use disposable suction catheter.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were pre-oxygenated before suctioning and
          manually ventilated with a self-inflating bag in between
          suction catheter passes. Normal saline was instilled at
          the discretion of the surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in an attempt to
          thin secretions. The volume of secretions aspirated were
          collected in a sputum trap and recorded. Suctioning was
          performed after each <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">P&PD</ENAMEX> period or at the time that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> would have been accomplished.
          All data were collected prospectively by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX>), who were present throughout
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h study period. Changes in ventilator settings
          were limited to temporary increases in inspired oxygen
          concentrations to alleviate hypoxemia (pulse oximetry
          saturation <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 90%</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          All data were collected and analyzed with commercially
          available data management and statistical software. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are shown as means ± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were analyzed with
          analysis of variance for repeated measures and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tukey</ENAMEX>'s
          test for post hoc analysis.
        
      
      
        Results
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> completed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h trial period. There were
        no statistically significant differences in the measured
        cardiorespiratory variables (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). There was a tendency
        for P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FIO</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.068</NUMEX>) and 
        V 
        d / 
        V 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> to decrease (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.62 ± 0.18</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.59</NUMEX> ±
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX>) during periods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX>, but
        these differences did not achieve statistical significance.
        There were no changes in P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> during the study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Airway
        pressures were unchanged during the study period and
        cardiac output was unaffected. VO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and VCO 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> tended to be higher during the periods
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> than without, although this difference was
        similarly not statistically significant. Results for the
        cardiorespiratory measurements are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        There were statistically significant increases in sputum
        volume during the periods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The addition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> did not increase sputum volume for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as a
        whole. However, in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> producing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40</NUMEX>
        ml of sputum per day, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> increased sputum volume
        significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> turns
        increased from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one every 2 h to one every 10 min</NUMEX> during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX>.
        During <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P&PD</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showed a rise in VO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and VCO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> associated with the procedure. In each
        case, the increase in VO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and VCO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> during manual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P&PD</ENAMEX> was greater
        than that during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P&PD</ENAMEX> provided by the bed. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case,
        P&PD with the bed was associated with multi-focal
        premature ventricular contractions and 'whip' artefact on
        the pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressure tracing. The intensity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">percussion</ENAMEX> was reduced and this problem was eliminated.
      
      
        Discussion
        Turning regimens are an essential part of the routine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of mechanically ventilated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Position
        changes are thought to reduce atelectasis, enhance fluid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mobilization</ENAMEX>, prevent skin breakdown, improve oxygenation,
        and decrease the incidence of hospital-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX> [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. This study was designed to study the
        acute effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> in comparison with manual turning, in
        paralyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>. Our study was designed to
        identify the underlying physiological changes that might be
        related to the positive outcomes attributed to position
        changes. The major findings of the study are as follows:
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX> are unaffected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a short period</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 h</ENAMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) secretion clearance is enhanced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
        P&PD results in an increase in sputum volume only in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with excessive secretions. These findings are
        specific to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of critically ill, paralyzed,
        surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>. Extrapolation of these
        findings to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient populations</ENAMEX> should be made with
        caution.
        Few studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> changes that might be responsible for
        positive outcomes seen with the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX>. Bein 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] recently compared the
        effects of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 min</TIMEX> period of rotation to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 min</NUMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supine</ENAMEX> position in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ARDS <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. They found an increase
        in P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FIO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">174 ± 82 to 217 ± 137</NUMEX> and
        decrease in intrapulmonary shunt from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 ± 14%</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.1</NUMEX> ±
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>. Using the multiple inert-gas elimination technique
        they attributed this improvement in gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> to a
        decrease in the amount of low ventilation/perfusion ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">V /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q</ENAMEX> ) lung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and increase in normal
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">V /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. In this study, measurements
        for the rotation periods were made with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extreme lateral</ENAMEX> position. This differs from our design.
        Bein 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> also found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        more severe lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murrary Lung</ENAMEX> injury score more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX>) did not respond to rotational therapy, whereas
        those with less severe disease (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 2.5</NUMEX>) had
        significant changes in P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FIO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . This can be explained by the changes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX> with time, as the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">evolves</ENAMEX> from a wet, heavy,
        atelectatic lung to a brittle fibrotic lung [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Early in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>, postural changes including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> and prone positioning
        can be effective in altering the distribution of
        ventilation and blood flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. In late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathophysiological</ENAMEX> changes seem to render postural changes
        largely ineffective.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] have shown previously that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">steep lateral positioning</ENAMEX> can result in either an
        improvement or a worsening of oxygenation. In their study
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with apparent bilateral lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, steep
        positioning resulted in a decrease in P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and an increase in P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. These measurements
        were made in the extreme lateral position. They found that
        continuous rotation returned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gas</ENAMEX> values to those in
        the supine position. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> also suggested that
        extreme changes in lateral posture were associated with
        adverse effects on hemodynamics in comparison with
        continuous rotation. Bein 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] have also reported
        adverse hemodynamic effects in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> placed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extreme lateral</ENAMEX> position. They suggested that the left
        lateral position resulted in a hyperdynamic state and that
        the right lateral position decreased right ventricular
        preload, resulting in hypotension. The measurement of
        plasma atrial natriuretic peptide indicated that these
        changes were due to the gravitational effects on the
        distensibility of the right heart. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        this study were not solely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARDS</ENAMEX>. We did not
        ascertain any significant hemodynamic effects during
        continuous rotation or manual turning. In many cases, pain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with manual turning resulted in transient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>. Our findings did not reveal
        the magnitude of changes in gas exchange seen by others.
        However, P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 /FIO</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> increased in every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> after a
        period of rotation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">188 ± 47</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">174</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>, range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-29</ENAMEX>)
        in our study. However, this difference was not
        statistically significant.
        Position changes in unilateral lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> have long
        been shown to be of value [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Placing the 'good lung'
        lower results in improved ventilation perfusion matching
        and an increase in oxygenation due to the gravitational
        effects on blood flow. More recently, the use of prone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">positioning</ENAMEX> has been shown to improve oxygenation in ARDS
        by improving distribution of ventilation through changes in
        regional pleural pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gradients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 19, 20</TIMEX>].
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positioning techniques alter ventilation
        perfusion relationships through very different mechanisms.
        Prone positioning uses the shape and size of the dorsal
        lung compared with the ventral lung to improve the
        distribution of ventilation in bilateral lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        Extreme lateral positioning attempts to alter perfusion
        through the effects of gravity.
        The process of routine turning is steeped in tradition,
        follows common-sense guidelines, and has some historical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prescedent</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> determined
        that the immobilized postoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was prone to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atelectasis</ENAMEX> in the dependent lung. Chulay 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] found that turning the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-h intervals during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 h</TIMEX> after
        coronary artery bypass surgery decreased the incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> and shortened ICU stay compared with patients
        remaining in the supine position. Routine turning also
        follows the normal pattern of sleep, where the average
        person changes posture every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> min [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. On the basis of
        this evidence, routine body position changes to prevent
        pulmonary complications have become a standard of care.
        Additionally, turning is important for decreasing skin
        breakdown and contributing to the mobilization of
        fluid.
        We did find that the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> significantly increased
        the number of times that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were turned each
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>. During scheduled turning every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
        turns occurred only <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every 3 h.</NUMEX> This finding is related in
        part to the study design, but is also related to the
        availability of staff. Turning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can be difficult
        owing to the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> size, patient
        weight, and the presence of traction, indwelling lines, and
        ancillary equipment surrounding the bed. During the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-h
        manual turning portion of the study, turning was
        accomplished less frequently owing to the workload of ICU
        staff. During continuous rotation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were turned
        from left to right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per hour</NUMEX>. Clearly, when used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appropriately</ENAMEX>, a rotational bed facilitates patient turning
        and reduces nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workload</ENAMEX> spent performing this
        task.
        We also demonstrated improved secretion clearance in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> that were unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX>.
        Compared with manual turning, continuous rotation seems to
        facilitate secretion clearance in paralyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This
        finding might be specific to paralyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are
        unable to cough. Changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> position are an important
        part of postural drainage and this is most likely to be the
        mechanism through which secretion clearance is enhanced.
        Acutely, improved secretion clearance might be responsible
        for the reported decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> during prolonged use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Interestingly, the addition of
        percussion to the postural drainage occurring during CLR
        failed to increase secretion clearance in our patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. However, previous work has questioned the use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without increased secretion
        production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> demonstrated
        high volumes of secretions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>); in each of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> increased secretion clearance. This finding
        is not wholly unexpected. Our results suggest that routine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> is unnecessary. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with excessive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretions</ENAMEX> seem to benefit from a combination of continuous
        rotation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX>. Whether this increase in secretion
        clearance alters outcomes cannot be determined from our
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24-h</NUMEX> study.
        The metabolic cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX> had been previously
        described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Horiuchi 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] have measured a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
        increase in VO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">P&PD</ENAMEX> in postoperative
        surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. This effect has been attributed to both
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-like and an exercise-like response of the patient
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&PD</ENAMEX>. In this most recent investigation, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found that VO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was increased both by manual turning
        into the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> decubitus position and by the
        administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">percussion</ENAMEX>. When vecuronium was given
        before the procedure, these changes in VO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were abated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggested
        that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> muscle activity and increased sympathetic
        output contribute to the increase in VO 
        2 seen during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">P&PD</ENAMEX>. Interestingly,
        our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> tolerated turning and percussion by the bed
        better than manual turning and percussion. The change in VO
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P&PD</ENAMEX> provided by the bed
        was much lower than that seen during manual techniques.
        This might be related to the abrupt changes that occur with
        manual turning, and pain associated with manual hand
        clapping on the chest wall.
        The study design and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h trial period impose
        significant limitations on the results. Because we
        attempted to determine physiological changes, a short study
        period was required. It might be that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> of CLR
        is required before the identification of beneficial
        effects. Our design cannot answer this question. All
        measurements were made by the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in an
        attempt to limit measurement errors. However, during a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
        period, changes in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> as a consequence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease progression</ENAMEX>/resolution might have occurred. We
        attempted to limit these confounding variables by
        randomizing the sequence of regimens. Variations in blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> over time in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> have been reported and
        demonstrate significant variation based on timing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. We
        attempted to standardize the collection of data to
        coincident events, to prevent variability.
        This investigation found that, whereas P 
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2</TIMEX> improved slightly during periods of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rotation</ENAMEX>, no significant increases in gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> were
        identified between manual turning every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX>. There
        were no adverse hemodynamic effects of either turning
        procedure. Continuous rotation did increase secretion
        clearance compared with manual turning, but the addition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">percussion</ENAMEX> did not further improve secretion removal. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with large secretion volumes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P&PD</ENAMEX> did
        increase secretion clearance. P&PD was better tolerated
        when delivered by the bed in comparison with manual
        turning, as judged by the change in VO 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . The acute effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> are
        undoubtedly different in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient populations</ENAMEX>. The
        link between acute physiological changes and improved
        outcomes associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLR</ENAMEX> remain to be determined.
