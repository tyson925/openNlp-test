        The history of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> began with the discovery in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927</TIMEX> of a semi-dominant mutation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, named 
        Brachyury , or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> for tail, that affects both
        embryonic viability in homozygotes and tail development in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This original 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> allele represents a deletion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">spanning 160-200</ENAMEX> kb (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ), the developmental
        effects of which have been well characterized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX>
        ] . Homozygous mutant embryos show a developmental failure
        of the notochord and posterior mesoderm, and die at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midgestation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Heterozygous mutant mice</ENAMEX> are born with
        shortened tails and malformed vertebrae. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, another
        spontaneous 
        Brachyury mutation, called 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wis</ENAMEX> , was reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> homozygous and heterozygous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX> are more severe than those of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> deletion, suggesting that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele acts as a dominant
        negative. Homozygous mutants have no somites at all and
        heterozygotes have no tail, rather than a shortened tail
        (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ).
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> gene was cloned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ,
        and its expression pattern was found to correlate with the
        tissue types affected in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Subsequently, T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was shown to bind specifically to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and its
        preferred 
        in vitro target sequence was
        identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . It was further shown that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> encodes a transcription factor
        capable of regulating expression of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> via the
        identified target sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In their report
        describing the initial cloning of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrmann et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] also
        demonstrated that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> results from the insertion of an
        endogenous retrovirus-like early transposon (ETn) element
        into the splice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX> of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> exon 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> locus. They showed that the splice
        site at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 7</ENAMEX> was mutated from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAG GTATGT</ENAMEX> to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAG</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTGTTG</ENAMEX> (where underlined sequence is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETn</ENAMEX> insertion sequence is in bold)
        and predicted that this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> would be nonfunctional,
        thereby abolishing splicing of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. They
        proposed that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele would produce a transcript
        comprised of exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> followed by read-through
        transcription of the ETn element, resulting in a modified
        C-terminal end, or alternatively, that upstream splice
        donor sites would be used, shortening the transcript and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein product</ENAMEX>. In later whole mount 
        in situ analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herrmann</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        confirmed expression of a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> locus-derived transcript in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> embryos, but did not examine its
        exact nature. The position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETn</ENAMEX> insertion (see Figure
        3A) is compatible with the idea that a modified protein
        could still bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> but might compete with the wild type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or form an inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with it, thus leading
        to a dominant negative effect.
        The aim of this study was to characterize the sequence
        and structure of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele transcript(s), with an eye
        towards understanding the specific molecular consequences
        of disruption of the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> splice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> site by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inserted ETn</ENAMEX> element. Using an RT-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based approach, we
        have shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 8</NUMEX> different transcripts are
        produced from the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> . In addition to the mutant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX> predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrmann et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        transcripts composed solely of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> exonic sequences, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> transcripts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containing ETn</ENAMEX> sequences spliced between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> exonic sequences were identified.
        All 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        Wis transcripts bypass the mutated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon 7</ENAMEX> splice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>, such that wild type 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> transcripts cannot be produced from
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele.

          The next step in characterizing the molecular nature
          of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele was to identify the
          aberrant transcripts produced from this allele. RT-PCR
          was performed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from

          reverse primers located in different exons of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> locus, as well as a reverse

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> insertion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> Figure
          1B). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> products were excised, purified, and
          sequenced twice on each strand with the primers used to
          generate them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F2-R1</ENAMEX> products were additionally

          Wis embryo together comprised 5
          aberrant transcripts (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, and Figure
          3C.). Transcripts representing an exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> splice
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,8</NUMEX>), an exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> splice (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,5,8</NUMEX>), and an exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> splice (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,8</NUMEX>) were all identified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> embryos. An additional mutant
          transcript resulted from an aberrant splicing event from
          exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> such that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> nucleotides (nt) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          end of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> were deleted (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7Î”35,8 and 4,5,6,7Î”35,8</NUMEX>).
          Another mutant transcript included an aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>exon
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> nt of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ETn</ENAMEX> derived-sequences inserted between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          deleted exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> splice (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,7Î”35</NUMEX>,+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37ETn,8</NUMEX> and

          As expected, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F1-BGH037</ENAMEX> primer set failed to
          amplify from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T +/</ENAMEX>+ embryo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). In
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wis embryo</ENAMEX>, this primer set
          detected a mutant transcript representing read-through
          transcription from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 7</ENAMEX> into the immediately 3' ETn
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Etn</ENAMEX>; Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>).
          In this preliminary analysis, no wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> transcript was identified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wis RNA</ENAMEX> using any of the primer
          sets. These results suggest that no 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          Wis transcripts maintain normal
          exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> splicing, as postulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrman et</ENAMEX>
          al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . To further clarify this issue, the splicing
          of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> was specifically examined using the
          forward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">primer F3</TIMEX>. This primer is located within the last
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 bp</TIMEX> of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, and therefore is deleted in all of the
          exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-containing mutant transcripts already described
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). RT-PCR analysis
          with this primer confirmed that while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F1</NUMEX>-BGH037
          transcript is only produced off the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F3-R1</ENAMEX> transcript is
          only produced off of the wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> allele (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          In some cases, a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> larger than the
          expected wild type size was amplified by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">F3</NUMEX>-R1
          primers from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wis embryo RNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Sequence
          analysis showed that this larger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          Wis specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> represented two
          additional aberrant transcripts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and Figure 3C</ENAMEX>).
          Notably, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> products were never observed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). A shorter
          variant contained the intact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 60</NUMEX> nt
          of read-through transcription into the ETn element
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spliced</ENAMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60ETn,8</NUMEX>). Given that the BGH037
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primer</ENAMEX> is contained within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> nt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETn</ENAMEX> read-through,
          this species is not necessarily distinct from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7</NUMEX>+ETn
          transcript amplified by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F1-BGH037</TIMEX>, as both could be
          amplified from the same hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60ETn,8</NUMEX>. The
          longer variant contained the intact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' end of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 7</ENAMEX> and
          60 nt of read-through into the ETn element spliced to a

          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60ETn</NUMEX>,+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37ETn,8</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nt ETn mini-exon</ENAMEX> was the same

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">amplified by F1-BGH037</ENAMEX>, as both could be amplified from

          Alternatively, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETn</ENAMEX> product might have amplified
          from an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7</NUMEX>+?<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETn</ENAMEX>, where an unknown amount of the ETn
          insertion was transcribed and the transcript terminated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETn</ENAMEX> sequence without being spliced to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Overall,
          wild type exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> splicing was never identified
          in transcripts produced from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> .
          The characterization of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele transcripts presented
          here confirms that the intron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> splice site is
          indeed non-functional such that wild type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> mRNA is never produced.
          Furthermore, the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETn</ENAMEX> transcript predicted by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrmann et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] was identified. However, at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> other 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          Wis mutant transcripts are also
          produced (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>). All of these transcripts serve to
          bypass the mutated splice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>; either by splicing
          over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 7</TIMEX>, activating a cryptic splice site within exon
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, or transcribing through exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7</ENAMEX> into the adjacent ETn
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The cryptic exon <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 splice</NUMEX> site used, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CCT GTGAGT</ENAMEX>, is a strong match to
          the 
          C<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/A</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> GT,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A/G</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGT</ENAMEX> splice donor
          consensus. It is important to note that in addition to
          the exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 to 8, exon 5 to 8</TIMEX>, and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 to 8</NUMEX> splicing
          events detected here, the potential remains that
          transcripts resulting from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1 to 8, exon 2 to 8</TIMEX>,
          and/or exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 8</NUMEX> splicing events are produced but were
          not discovered.
          Genetically, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> allele acts as a dominant
          negative in that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wis /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX> have a more severe
          phenotype than the null 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T/T</ENAMEX> embryos. However, the
          biochemical nature of this dominant negative effect is
          not known. This study confirms previous work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          showing the existence of a transcript that would result
          in a truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> if translated. Because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>domain would be intact, this hypothetical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> could compete with the wild type protein
          producing a dominant negative effect. Alternatively, the
          presence of heterologous Etn element sequences in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          Wis transcripts may stimulate
          posttranscriptional gene silencing by an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-induced
          silencing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (RISC)-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> degradation pathway
          which could target degradation of wild type transcripts [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that disruption of a single splice donor
        site within a multi-exon locus can lead to a dramatic
        misregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA splicing</ENAMEX>. A straightforward prediction
        suggests that in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
        Wis transcripts, splicing "out of"
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exon</ENAMEX> 7 would simply fail and result in a transcript
        terminating with the ETn element. In reality the effect is
        much more complex, cautioning against the use of
        straightforward assumptions in predicting the molecular
        consequences of genetic alterations.
