        Characterized examples of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metazoans</ENAMEX> can be broadly divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories (see [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>] for extensive review). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antisense RNAs</ENAMEX> transcribed
        from loci distinct from their putative targets, such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lin-4</ENAMEX> of 
        Caenorhabditis elegans , are
        generally short and have the potential to form imperfect
        duplexes with complementary regions of their sense
        counterparts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In contrast, antisense transcripts that
        originate from the same genomic region (but with opposing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orientation</ENAMEX>) have, by virtue of their common but
        complementary origin, the potential to form long perfect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplexes</ENAMEX>.
        Experimental evidence suggests a functional role for
        sense-antisense pairings at a surprising variety of levels
        in mammalian gene regulation, including genomic imprinting
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], translational regulation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>], alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        editing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Where the mode of regulation has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX> in detail each case has proved unique, so that it
        is difficult to make generalizations about mechanism or
        function. In transfection assays, full-length constructs of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> splice variants of an endogenous coding transcript
        containing regions antisense to the 
        FGF2 (fibroblast growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-2</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> can each suppress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels (but not mRNA levels)
        of FGF2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. A non-coding transcript antisense to a
        homeobox gene, 
        MSX1 , has a conserved transcription
        initiation site and is expressed in inverse correlation to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MSX1 protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. 
        SCA8 , an untranslated transcript
        implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, overlaps the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' translation and transcription sites of 
        KLHL1 , a gene primarily expressed in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cerebellum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XIST</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSIX</ENAMEX> are conserved, overlapping, but
        oppositely oriented non-coding transcripts, which serve
        crucial functions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>-inactivation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Several imprinted
        loci generate multiple sense and antisense transcripts that
        are subject to reciprocal genomic imprinting, and a recent
        study demonstrated 
        in vivo that premature termination of
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIR</ENAMEX> , a non-coding imprinted
        antisense transcript, results in a failure to imprint
        several sense counterparts [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] suggested
        that this phenomenon might be much more widespread than
        previously believed, and hypothesized that the existence of
        functionally relevant overlapping antisense transcripts
        might explain a subset of the many cases in which strong
        evolutionary conservation is observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
        untranslated regions of mammalian genes.
        Consistent with this, the number of known examples of
        pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA species</ENAMEX> with the potential to form long
        sense-antisense duplexes has increased steadily. We
        reviewed the literature and found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> such cases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>),
        and a recent analysis identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 80</NUMEX> additional
        pairs of annotated human mRNAs that originate from the same
        genomic locus and share regions of overlap [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. We
        postulated that additional examples of this phenomenon
        might be obtainable by mining public human and mouse
        expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>) databases.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, consisting in sum of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of single-pass sequence reads, have been generated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> from around the world, using a variety of
        methods, and deposited into public sequence databases.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] is an experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algorithm</ENAMEX> developed at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>, in which full-length mRNA and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences are
        partitioned into a non-redundant set of gene-oriented
        clusters on the basis of nucleotide-level identity (using
        annotated mRNAs as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">initializing seeds</ENAMEX>), but these clusters
        are not further curated. The avoidance of spurious
        alignments by masking of transcribed repetitive elements,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> contaminants or low-complexity sequence is an
        important part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> build procedure. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Each EST</TIMEX>
        thus belongs to both an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> from which it
        was sequenced (for example, a specific tissue from a
        specific individual) and a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster (along
        with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> that are presumably derived from the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>). We hypothesized that as a consequence of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automation of the UniGene</ENAMEX> build procedure, unannotated
        antisense transcripts might be found co-clustered with
        their sense counterparts. As nearly all annotated mRNAs in
        GenBank serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UniGene cluster seeds</ENAMEX> (and therefore
        cannot be co-clustered with one another), such a strategy
        is strongly biased towards finding pairs of overlapping
        transcripts where one or both of the transcripts are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unannotated</ENAMEX>.
        Our bioinformatics and experimental strategy involved
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> steps. We first identified <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> that were
        directionally cloned and sequenced (that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX> and sequenced in a defined orientation with respect
        to the mRNA transcript); then, focusing exclusively on ESTs
        from such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, we searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters
        containing a statistically significant number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misoriented ESTs</ENAMEX>. We then mapped the mRNA and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters to their genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinates</ENAMEX> and evaluated whether putative sense and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisense ESTs</ENAMEX> in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster represented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">distinct RNA species</ENAMEX>, on the basis of differential
        exon-intron splicing structures, the locations of poly(A)
        signals and tails, and patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-human sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>. Finally, we experimentally validated a subset
        of the predictions by orientation-specific reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription PCR</ENAMEX> (RT-PCR).
      
      
        Results
        A major obstacle to deducing the transcriptional
        orientation of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> is that not all cloning
        methods used to generate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are directional. For
        example, a substantial fraction of publicly available ESTs
        were generated by a random priming method that provides no
        information about directionality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>],
        whereas other methods that exploit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' polyadenylated
        tails of eukaryotic mRNAs do provide directional
        information. Rather than relying on fragmentary library
        annotation, we developed a simple measure of the quality of
        directional cloning of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. A subset of
        UniGene clusters includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> full-length mRNA
        sequence for which the correct transcriptional orientation
        is known. Focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> belonging to these clusters, we
        estimated 
        in silico the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> that were correctly oriented, relative to the
        mRNA-defined orientations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Our subsequent
        analysis focused exclusively on ESTs from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">899</NUMEX> human and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">176</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse libraries</ENAMEX> for which we estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> were in the correct orientation.
        As expected, a small fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 1.5%</NUMEX> on
        average) from these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were incorrectly oriented.
        Our null hypothesis was that these represented random
        artifacts that would be distributed across the full set of
        UniGene clusters in a manner proportional to the size of
        the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters. In other words, we
        expected that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.5%</NUMEX> of the directionally cloned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> in
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster would be correctly oriented. Binomial
        statistics were applied to identify UniGene clusters that
        contained a statistically significant overrepresentation of
        incorrectly oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>. For the substantial subset of
        UniGene clusters for which the dominant transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> was unannotated, we required that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misoriented</ENAMEX> ESTs be significantly overrepresented
        regardless of the correct orientation of the cluster. In
        total, we were able to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">549</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human
        clusters that significantly deviated from the null
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
        We next sought to address the possibility that a
        significant number of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> could represent
        systematic errors (for example, systematic bias for
        directional-cloning artifacts to occur in association with
        specific transcripts) or errors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> clustering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>. We postulated that if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct, overlapping
        but oppositely oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA species</ENAMEX> were present in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">single UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster, they should map to the same genomic
        region, but should possess significantly distinguishable
        exon-intron splicing structures.
        We used publicly available tools (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEGABLAST</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and
        SIM4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]) to map the exon-intron splicing structures of
        the relevant set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and mRNAs from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX> onto draft assemblies of the human and mouse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. Patterns of evolutionary conservation
        between these assemblies were determined by reference to a
        whole-genome set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.15 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-human
        sequence alignments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Graphical representations were
        manually reviewed to evaluate whether the putative sense
        and antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> represented distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA species</ENAMEX>, on the
        basis of differential exon-intron splicing structures,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) signal and tail locations, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-human
        conservation patterns. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144</NUMEX> human and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> mouse
        UniGene clusters that each appear to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct
        but oppositely oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA species</ENAMEX>, co-clustered in
        UniGene as a consequence of a bidirectionally transcribed
        region of overlap. Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4, 5, 6,</ENAMEX> 7present several
        interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> examples of distinguishable
        exon-intron splicing structures of sense and antisense ESTs
        over the relevant genomic regions. For a data file
        containing a full tabulated list of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, see
        Additional data files and our website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Graphical
        representations for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, similar to those in
        Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>, are also available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        To further validate our methodology, we sought to
        confirm a subset of our predictions experimentally. An
        orientation-specific RT-PCR assay was applied to test the
        directionality of transcription over the regions of
        predicted overlap (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Primers were designed to
        amplify regions of predicted bidirectional transcription.
        The relative orientation of transcription was assessed by
        restricting which primers were present during the reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> (RT) single-strand synthesis step of the
        reaction. Although total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from a series of different
        human tissues was used as template, only one tissue type
        was assayed per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, with the choice for each
        candidate geared towards the tissue types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> from
        which putative antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> were derived. We successfully
        detected the presence of antisense transcription over the
        queried region for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> tested, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
        out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> negative controls (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, both sense and antisense transcription was
        detected in the same tissue.
      
      
        Discussion
        Our bioinformatics approach identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> candidate
        instances of overlapping transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the human
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse genomes</ENAMEX>. We characterized the genomic arrangement
        of each pair of overlapping transcripts relative to one
        another (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3a</ENAMEX>, see also Additional data files). Our
        results are generally consistent with those of Lehner 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], in that the majority
        of overlapping pairs can be described as having a
        tail-to-tail (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>' to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>') arrangement. We were also
        interested in whether sense and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA species</ENAMEX> in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> clusters represented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding or
        untranslated transcripts. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, we determined
        the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> match to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> oriented in both the sense
        and antisense direction. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clusters</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX> contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> with significant homology to a
        known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> on both strands, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> strand, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> on
        neither strand. The identities of these best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-level
        matches are provided as additional data with this paper and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> with the graphical representation of each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> at our website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. It is possible that a
        subset of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> with no significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-level match on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both strands include ESTs
        derived from non-coding transcripts. However, as ESTs
        represent fragments of the full transcripts, we cannot be
        certain about this until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">full-length RNA species</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX>. The characteristics of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate pair</ENAMEX> with
        respect to observed coding potential and observed splicing
        (with the same caveat of being based on limited
        information) are listed in the additional data and are
        summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3b</ENAMEX>.
        The misinterpretation of genomic contaminants as
        putative antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> is a clear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. The
        observation of transcript splicing, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein homology</ENAMEX> and/or
        derivation from multiple independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> for any
        given set of putative antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> is evidence against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic</ENAMEX> contamination. We have flagged (as requiring
        particular caution) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> cases where the set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antisense ESTs</ENAMEX> derive from one or a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, and are
        not observed to be spliced or have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein homologies</ENAMEX> (see
        Additional data files).
        Experimental validation of a subset of our predictions
        by orientation-specific RT-PCR supports our bioinformatics
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX>. We estimate that our approach has a
        specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX>, as we were able to detect antisense
        transcription over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> regions queried. This may be a
        low-end estimate as we only queried one tissue per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, and cell type and/or temporal specificity of
        antisense transcript expression might explain our inability
        to confirm antisense transcription for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates experimentally</ENAMEX>. These same factors (differential
        temporal or cell-type distribution) may explain why the
        sense transcript (all of which are annotated mRNAs in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> cases that we attempted to experimentally verify) was
        not detected for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that were positive for
        antisense transcription.
        The observation of highly conserved regions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' untranslated regions (UTRs) of a large fraction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammalian genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] has been an intriguing mystery.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] hypothesized that the existence of
        functionally relevant overlapping antisense transcripts
        might explain a subset of these cases. Indeed, with a
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> we do observe interesting correlations
        between mouse-human nucleotide-level conservation patterns
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTRs</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>(s) of overlap with the putative
        antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. This includes both cases where the
        antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has homology to a known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (Figures
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 7</ENAMEX>) and cases where it does not (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; UniGene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster Mm.</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41304</NUMEX>; UniGene cluster <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Mm.183060</NUMEX>).
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> cases in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> are clear orthologs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of
        these cases, the location, coding potential/identity and
        pattern of the overlap with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA species</ENAMEX> is
        highly consistent between the mouse and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>,
        supporting the argument for functional relevance of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlaps</ENAMEX>. Why is such little intersection observed between
        the human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> sets? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that
        many of the examples of overlaps, whether functionally
        relevant or not, are not general to mammals but are
        lineage-specific in nature. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility is that
        our method has a high frequency of false-negatives.
        Although <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> databases are growing rapidly, it is clear
        that they are still under-sampling the full mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptome</ENAMEX>. Undersampling of the transcriptome by either
        or both the mouse and human <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> databases might be expected
        to contribute significantly to the false negative rate, and
        consequently to the relatively limited intersection between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> sets. We are carrying out
        experiments to test mouse-human conservation of predicted
        overlaps more directly by focused and sensitive
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX> such as quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and
        oligonucleotide arrays.
        As the proposed mechanisms by which the formation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex dsRNA</ENAMEX> can potentially affect gene regulation
        are so varied [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>], it is
        difficult to draw inferences regarding function without
        further experiments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the few areas where
        functionally relevant information on sequences is available
        relates to the neoplastic versus non-neoplastic nature of
        the tissue of origin of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. An interesting
        example is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hs.288835</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>),
        which contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIDEB</ENAMEX> (cell-death inducing DFFA-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effector B</ENAMEX>). Noting that the sense transcript encoded a
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor, we checked the annotated tissue
        origin of these ESTs, and found that a significantly
        greater fraction of the antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34/46</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.74</NUMEX>) than
        the sense ESTs (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3/15</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.2</NUMEX>) were derived from neoplastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.0002</NUMEX> by chi-squared
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistic</ENAMEX>). As the sense transcript codes for a
        pro-apoptotic gene, the result immediately suggests the
        interesting hypothesis that upregulation of the antisense
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA species</ENAMEX> in cancer tissues has functional relevance with
        respect to suppression of the potentially tumor-suppressing
        sense gene.
        It is worth noting that stages of our methodology may
        also be useful for determining the correct transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orientation of UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters that contain no annotated
        mRNA sequences. Many probes on orientation-sensitive
        oligonucleotide arrays for unknown genes are often based on
        such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>, and knowledge of the correct transcriptional
        orientation of each cluster may help circumvent problems
        such as those recently encountered in the design of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> mouse chip [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        We observed surprisingly little redundancy (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> out of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>) between our results and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literature</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). As the sampling strategies applied
        seem more orthogonal than similar, it is difficult to
        assess how many more examples of overlapping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse genomes</ENAMEX> remain
        to be discovered. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shoemaker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] carried
        out an experiment in which they queried the transcription
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 400,000</NUMEX> exon predictions using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strand-specific
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-mer</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oligonucleotide probe sets</ENAMEX> per exon. The negative
        controls, a set of probes that were the reverse complement
        of probes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78,486</NUMEX> confirmed exons, indicated a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
        false-positive rate. We speculate that a subset of these
        false positives may have actually represented
        bidirectionally transcribed regions of the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results, in conjunction with the literature, bring
        the total number of predicted and validated examples of
        overlapping but oppositely oriented transcripts to over
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>. Given the variety of gene-regulatory phenomena that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex dsRNA</ENAMEX> has been suggested or shown to influence
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>], experimental approaches
        are required to query whether and how each of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlaps</ENAMEX> is functionally relevant.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Identification of high-quality directionally cloned
          ESTlibraries
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human UniGene</ENAMEX> (Build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse UniGene</ENAMEX> (Build
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>) datasets were downloaded from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 January</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>. A useful feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> resource is the
          identification of a single sequence in each cluster as
          its longest high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. We refer to this set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> as the best-of-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX> (BOU) sequences.
          To assess the quality of directional cloning in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>, we applied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEGABLAST</ENAMEX> tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] to align
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU of the UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster to which they
          belonged. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, we then calculated the
          fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> ESTs that were deposited in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> as the BOU sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster to
          which they belonged. This fraction, a metric of the
          quality of directional cloning of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, is
          referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> quality score (LQS).
          Our original analysis was revised in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways to
          improve its accuracy. Our goal of calculating library
          quality by estimating the 'correctness' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">of EST</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> is complicated by the fact that not every
          UniGene cluster contains an mRNA with a defined open
          reading frame (ORF), and not every BOU sequence is
          deposited in the correct orientation (in other words, the
          correct orientation of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters is not known
          definitively). We therefore revised our analysis to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculate LQS</ENAMEX> scores exclusively from UniGene clusters
          whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> was an mRNA with an annotated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> window (indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> is deposited in the
          correct orientation). We subsequently refer to these as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'oriented BOUs</ENAMEX>'. Another caveat arises in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that 3</TIMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> reads of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">directionally cloned ESTs</ENAMEX> are
          generally not reoriented before deposit of sequences in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>. We resolved this issue by 'flipping' 
          in silico sequences annotated as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          reads. The results of this analysis on the human <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          dataset are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In our final analysis
          (green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the distribution of LQS scores
          across the full set of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">UniGene EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> is roughly
          bimodal, with a peak near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LQS</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> (random orientation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>) and a peak near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LQS</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> (correct orientation
          of nearly all ESTs). These peaks correspond broadly to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libraries</ENAMEX> generated by non-directional and directional
          cloning methods, respectively.
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,525</NUMEX> human and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">566 mouse EST libraries</TIMEX>
          considered, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">899 and 176</NUMEX>, respectively, had an LQS of
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>, indicating that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were
          generated by an efficient method of directional cloning.
          The remainder of our analysis focused exclusively on the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,151,724</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">550,567</NUMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ESTs</ENAMEX> derived from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LQS</ENAMEX> scores of greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>. A
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> list of the mouse and human <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> and their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LQS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> is available at our website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Statistically significant overrepresentation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misoriented ESTs</ENAMEX> in a subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters
          Our null hypothesis was that the relatively small
          fraction of misoriented ESTs from high-quality
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">directionally cloned EST</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1.5%</NUMEX>)
          represented random artifacts, leading to the expectation
          that they would be distributed across the full set of
          UniGene clusters in a manner proportional to the sizes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters. We applied binomial
          distribution probability analysis to identify clusters
          that significantly deviated from this expectation with a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.00001</NUMEX>
          (roughly equivalent to the number of hypotheses being
          tested). This analysis was sufficient for UniGene
          clusters with an oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> (see above). To avoid
          excluding from consideration UniGene clusters without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oriented BOU</ENAMEX> sequences, we again applied the binomial
          distribution probability test, with an additional
          requirement; the result had to be significant ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.00001</NUMEX>) regardless of
          whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> was correctly or incorrectly oriented.
          For example, the observation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> cluster with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ESTs deposited in the same orientation as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ESTs oriented opposite to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> would deviate
          significantly from the null hypothesis expectation of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.5%</NUMEX> regardless of whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> was correctly
          oriented or not. This approach identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297</NUMEX> human and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">252</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse UniGene clusters</ENAMEX> that contained a statistically
          significant over-representation of incorrectly oriented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Mapping of exon-intron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and
          mRNAs from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters to the mouse and
          human genomes
          We downloaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> human genome draft assembly
          (Build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Celera mouse genome</ENAMEX> draft
          assembly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera</ENAMEX> mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> is not generally accessible, draft assemblies of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> genome based on the public sequencing effort
          have recently been released, and we anticipate that use
          of these assemblies would yield essentially equivalent
          results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEGABLAST</ENAMEX> tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] was used to
          identify the approximate genomic coordinates for each
          UniGene cluster (for example, the contig on which a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> appeared to be located). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SIM4</NUMEX> tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] was
          then applied to map the exon-intron splicing coordinates
          of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOU</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences more precisely. We
          have exploited mouse-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synteny</ENAMEX> and the availability
          of draft assemblies of the mouse and human genomes to
          generate a set of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 1.15 million</NUMEX> mouse-human
          sequence alignments. These have been used to create
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlay</ENAMEX> versions of each genome, in which the most
          conserved sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 10%</NUMEX> of each genome) is
          overlaid with homologous sequence of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
          More detailed descriptions of the methodology followed
          and general statistics on this resource (HUMMUS) is
          available over the web [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The graphical
          representations integrating information on transcript
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX>, exon-intron structure, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-human
          genomic conservation were generated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNUPLOT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].

          Assessment of transcriptional directionality via
          RT-PCR assay
          Primers were designed with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PRIMER3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] algorithm
          and custom synthesized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operon</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, primers
          were selected to amplify a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-200</ENAMEX> base-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>)
          sequence that was internal to a predicted region of
          transcriptional overlap. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> were designed to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">amplify 100-200 bp</ENAMEX> as well, either from non-overlapping
          regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> transcripts or randomly selected
          regions of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> transcripts. Templates included
          total human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from placenta, kidney, brain, thymus or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uterus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). For each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> or control, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          RT-PCR reactions were carried out using total human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          from a single tissue as template. We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen One</ENAMEX>
          Step <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> kit according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol,
          except that reaction volume was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 μl</NUMEX>.
          Orientation of transcripts was assessed by restricting
          which primers were present during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> single-strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>. The cycling parameters were as follows: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          50°C × <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 min</NUMEX>, reverse transcription single-strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, both or neither primer); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) 95°C ×
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX>, activate AmpliTaq polymerase, inactivate RT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>, add missing primers; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94°C × 30</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commence</ENAMEX> PCR cycling; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56°C × 30 sec</TIMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72°C × 30</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) go to step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> in total); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72°C × 10</TIMEX>
          min.
          The inclusion of step (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) ensures that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> will be
          inactivated before addition of missing primers. For each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> or control primer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> RT-PCR reactions
          were carried out using total human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from a single
          tissue as template. In the first reaction, both primers
          were present during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> single-strand synthesis (positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>). In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reaction, only the primer
          complementary to the antisense-orientation of the PCR
          product was present during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> single-strand synthesis (to
          assay for antisense transcription). In the third
          reaction, only the primer complementary to the
          sense-orientation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was present during
          RT single-strand synthesis (to assay for sense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>). In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> reaction, neither primer
          was present during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> single-strand synthesis (control
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic</ENAMEX> contamination). Primers were designed to
          amplify regions of predicted bidirectional transcription
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> negative controls.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> negative controls was discarded because no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lane</ENAMEX> gave rise to a sharp band of the proper size. In all
          other cases, a sharp band of expected size was observed
          in one or more of the reactions.
        
        
          Determination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> homologies of sense and
          antisense oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> clusters
          We applied the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTX</ENAMEX> tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>] to blast each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45,588</NUMEX> relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> sequences that belonged
          to both high-quality directionally cloned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">UniGene</ENAMEX> clusters against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> nr database
          (non-redundant database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences deposited in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>), with a threshold expectation value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1e</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
          Summary information for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> on the best
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein alignment</ENAMEX> for ESTs oriented in each sense is
          available as additional data (see Additional data
