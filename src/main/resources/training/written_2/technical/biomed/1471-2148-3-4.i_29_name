        Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encode the sequence-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding
        subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, the
        defining feature of which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain, a highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">conserved 128</ENAMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding,
        heterodimerization, nucleotide binding, and nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain is named after the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to be discovered, the regulatory
        gene 
        runt from 
        Drosophila melanogaster . Runx genes
        have also been discovered and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionally</ENAMEX> characterized in
        mammals, sea urchins and nematodes, and in general are
        involved in the transcriptional control of developmental
        processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, mutations in each of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> caused by
        defective control of cell proliferation and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Most studies of Runx gene
        function and regulation have been carried out in mammals
        and in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , each of which has
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multiple Runx</ENAMEX> genes. It is not currently known how the Runx
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> family evolved, nor is it known how many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Runx</ENAMEX> genes
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal possessed</ENAMEX>. Answering these questions will
        facilitate identification of primitive (general) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">derived</ENAMEX> (specialized) aspects of Runx gene structure,
        function and regulation.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          The collection of Runx gene sequences from
          phylogenetically diverse model organisms
          Sequence similarity searches of public databases using
          the BLAST program [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] were used to collect a set of
          currently available Runx gene sequences (listed in
          Supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) from phylogenetically diverse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with complete or nearly complete genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Previously <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">undescribed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runx</ENAMEX> genes collected in
          our BLAST searches include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the puffer fish
          ( 
          Takifugu rubripes ) genome, a
          single gene from the sea squirt ( 
          Cionia intestinalis ) genome, three
          genes from the mosquito ( 
          Anopheles gambiae ) genome, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          new Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly ( 
          Drosophila melanogaster )genome.
          Also collected in the set for comparison were the
          previously-described <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">runt</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lozenge</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ), 
          Caenorhabditis elegans ( 
          run [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] ), sea urchin ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpRunt</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] ), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. rubripes</ENAMEX> ( 
          TrRunx2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> ( 
          Runx1 , 
          Runx2 , and 
          Runx3 ; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RUNX genes</ENAMEX>,
          which have been extensively characterized previously, are
          highly similar to their mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] and
          hence were not included in the collected set). The
          collected set of sequences thus contains representatives
          of several major bilaterian phyla within both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deuterostomes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chordata</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echinodermata</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protostomes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nematoda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthropoda</ENAMEX>). Runx sequences
          from lophotrochozoans and from basal (non-bilaterian)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metazoans</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cnidaria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porifera</ENAMEX>) are not found in
          the database, and it is not yet known whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-bilaterian Runx</ENAMEX> genes exist. Extensive BLAST and
          PSI-BLAST searches of the public databases failed to
          recover any sequences with significant similarity to the
          Runt domain from non-metazoan <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> with completed or
          nearly completed genomes, suggesting that Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may
          be a metazoan invention. The closest amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence
          similarity of any part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain to sequences
          outside of metazoa is found in the motif <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GRSGRGKSF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), which matches the nucleotide binding P-loop
          sequence in various bacterial and archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with diverse functions. This Runx sequence is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionally</ENAMEX> involved in minor groove interactions and
          DNA bending by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . An important
          difference between it and 
          bona fide P-loops is that the
          latter are invariably followed by an α-helix, whereas the
          structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain is all beta (see below).
          Thus, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runx P</ENAMEX>-loop-like motif is capable of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binding ATP</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , it is unclear whether this local
          sequence similarity is indicative of homology to the
          prokaryotic P-loop.
          Supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>
          The collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> used in this study. This
          table indicates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of Runx gene sequences from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">selected species</ENAMEX>, and additional references that were
          used in the analysis. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> intestinalis Runx gene ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CiRunt</ENAMEX> ) was derived from a contig
          assembled using shot-gun sequence segments queried from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>'s trace archive. The accession number given can be
          used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> for querying the database start the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrieval</ENAMEX> of necessary sequence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector NTI</ENAMEX> ContigXpress
          was used to assemble the sequence. Verification of 
          CiRunt was performed by comparing
          the gDNA to cDNA available on-line at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nori</ENAMEX> Satoh
          Laboratory web page. Only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cDNA sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">accession</ENAMEX> number is given and can be used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> to
          extract the remaining sequences. There was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × coverage
          of the cDNA. A special note needs to be made about the
          sequence upstream from the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain. The
          sequence from the start of the runt gene to the start of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain is theoretical. No cDNA could be found to
          verify this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T. rubripes Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were derived
          from scaffolds available on-line at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRC HGMP-RC</ENAMEX> site.

          Runx gene copy number
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the invertebrates in our collection with
          completely sequenced genomes, the protostome 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and the deuterostome 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> intestinalis , each were found
          to contain a single Runx gene. Screens of genomic
          libraries using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain sequence as probe
          indicate that the same is also apparently true of the sea
          urchin 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> purpuratus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , although
          final verification of this awaits the completion of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> urchin genome. In contrast, the model organisms in
          which most functional studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> have been
          performed (i.e. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>) each
          contain multiple Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Both of the vertebrate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species surveyed (mouse</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> rubripes ) were each found to
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, as was the mosquito 
          A. gambiae , whereas 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>.
          The simplest explanation of such a gene distribution
          is that possession of a single Runx gene is the primitive
          condition for bilaterians, i.e., that the multiplicity of
          Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the vertebrate and arthropod lineages
          resulted from independent gene duplications within those
          respective lineages. The results of a phylogenetic
          analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain sequences are consistent with
          this hypothesis (see below). Since fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          each contain multiple Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, it is probable that
          each of those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has acquired specialized (e.g.,
          region- or tissue-specific) functions that were derived
          subsequent to the duplications, and hence peculiar to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxonomic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to which each of those model organisms
          belong. Experimental studies of invertebrates that
          contain only a single Runx gene (sea urchin, tunicate,
          and nematode) are therefore likely to highlight primitive
          (general) functions of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of transcription
          factors in the control of cell fate, proliferation, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> during metazoan development.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> and intron positions among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Runx</ENAMEX> genes
          The gross structural features of the collected Runx
          genes, including positions of exons and introns
          (excepting those upstream of the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the
          vertebrate Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> - see below), are depicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schematically</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>(see also Supplemental Table
          2and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Supplemental Figure 1</ENAMEX>). To locate exon-intron
          positions in previously uncharacterised <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (or
          predicted genes) that have not yet been associated with
          cDNAs, we performed spliced alignment, maintaining
          maximum similarity between homologues, as described in
          Methods. As can be seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, all of the Runx
          genes contain a central, highly conserved exon, which
          encodes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain (black
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">box</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal end of this exon is
          bounded by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX> whose position is absolutely
          conserved among all Runx genes except 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DmRunt</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AgRunt</ENAMEX> (which have apparently lost
          the intron), while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal end is bounded by an
          intron that is conserved among all deuterostome species
          in our collection, and shifted but a few nucleotides
          downstream in the insect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and upstream in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans gene. The existence and
          locations of all of the other introns are variable, but
          some of them are characteristic of specific clades.

          All of the chordate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> (including 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CiRunt</ENAMEX> ) contain an intron within
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain, the position of
          which is invariant with respect to nucleotide sequence.
          This intron is missing in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX>, including
          the sea urchin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpRunt</ENAMEX> ), and is therefore likely
          to be a chordate-specific feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runx</ENAMEX> genes that
          arose prior to the Runx gene duplications in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">vertebrate</ENAMEX> lineage. Upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain, 
          TrRunx1 is predicted to have two
          short introns that are not found in its mouse orthologue
          ( 
          MmRunx1 ) or in any of the other
          chordate Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> have longer
          introns than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in 
          Takifugu , as might be expected
          based on relative genome sizes. With the exception of 
          DmRunt , all of the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DmLozenge</ENAMEX> is conserved in one of
          the mosquito <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AgLozenge</ENAMEX> ), indicating that these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are orthologues, which is confirmed by a
          phylogenetic analysis of sequences (see below). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CeRun</ENAMEX> contains an intron within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain that is not found in
          any other Runx gene, and contains the largest number of
          exons of any of the genes in our collection. In general,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans gene is the most
          divergent of all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          A variable number of exons are found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' of the Runt
          domain among different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and these reveal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-specific patterns. Except for the 
          lozenge orthologues, which contain
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such exons, all of the insect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for which
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> are available contain only a single
          exon downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain. The same is
          apparently true for the single sea urchin gene (although
          this is provisionally based on the fragmentary evidence
          of a single small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ), suggesting that a
          single exon downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain may be the
          primitive condition for bilaterians. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vertebrates</TIMEX> (from
          the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>), the 
          Runx3 orthologues each contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          exons downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain, while the 
          Runx2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologues</ENAMEX> contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> and the
          
          Runx1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologues</ENAMEX> contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CiRunt</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> exons downstream
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain, while 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CeRun</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In vertebrates at
          least, the multiplicity of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> is reflected
          in a large variety of alternatively spliced transcripts
          that give rise to multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein isoforms</ENAMEX> that differ
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal sequences appended to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . It is important to note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          exon of all Runx genes identified to date encodes the
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence VWRPY</ENAMEX> (or the functionally equivalent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IWRPF</ENAMEX> in the case of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans ), which acts as a
          recruitment motif for the co-repressor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Groucho/TLE</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
          . This motif is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-most exon
          of all of the genes, possibly with the exception of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CiRunt</ENAMEX> (where the open reading
          frame apparently continues beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VWRPY</ENAMEX> in the genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequence</ENAMEX>), and was used in our analysis to identify the
          C-terminal exons of previously uncharacterised Runx
          genes.
        
        
          Runt domain sequences across phylogeny
          The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domains of all
          each of the collected genes, together with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previously
          described sequences from the spider 
          Cupiennius salei [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , a
          sequence from the crayfish 
          Pacifastacus leniusculus , and one
          from the nematode 
          Meloidogyne hapla , were aligned
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustal W</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          Functionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain is required both for DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and for interaction with its heterodimeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> (the beta subunit), which serves to
          allosterically enhance the DNA binding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 14</ENAMEX> ] . Superposition of the alignment and the known
          crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> Runx1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 17</NUMEX> ] reveals that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that make either direct or indirect contact with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> are invariant (marked by asterisks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Sequence motifs that interact with the beta subunit are
          also highly conserved.
          The alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> was
          used to construct unrooted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> by several complementary
          approaches (neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood, and
          maximum-parsimony, described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methods</ENAMEX>). We also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">employed Bayesian</ENAMEX> inference of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phylogeny</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . This
          analysis was performed using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137</NUMEX> aligned amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with
          no gaps (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and included all of the sequences shown
          in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2except</TIMEX> for the incomplete sequences from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spider</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> salei run-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and from the
          root-knot nematode ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. hapla</ENAMEX> ). The consensus topology
          produced by each method was largely consistent with
          accepted phylogenies for all nodes with significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> values (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>); the main observations derived
          from each method are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The consensus
          of phylogenetic approaches strongly indicates the
          monophyly of the deuterostome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> in the
          collection, with the expected relationships
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">echinoderms</NUMEX>(urochordates(vertebrates))). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> also
          suggest that the gene duplications that produced the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vertebrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runx</ENAMEX> genes occurred early in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chordate</ENAMEX> lineage leading to vertebrates, but subsequent
          to its divergence from urochordates. All of the trees
          place 
          Runx1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">basal</ENAMEX> to 
          Runx3 and 
          Runx2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), arguing
          against an earlier proposal for the basal position of 
          Runx3 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 13</ENAMEX> ] among the vertebrate
          genes, which was inferred from relative gene size,
          exon-intron structure, and pattern of expression.
          While the consensus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1is
          for the most part consistent with the expected monophyly
          of the protostome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in our collection (nematodes,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthropods</ENAMEX>), the branching order is ambiguous. Among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, each of the mosquito genes can be
          confidently assigned orthologues from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), as was also
          suggested by intron positions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Beyond that, low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> values prohibit a confident assessment of
          evolutionary branching order of the arthropod Runx
          paralogues, and it is not clear whether they are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monophyletic</ENAMEX> (although the position of the crayfish gene
          suggests a deep duplication event within in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">insect/crustacean</ENAMEX> clade at least). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution</ENAMEX> of the
          evolutionary relationships among the protostome Runx
          genes will require a broader sampling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> from
          Arthropods as well as from protostomes in general.
          The occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in vertebrates,
          each on a different chromosome, is consistent with a
          scenario of multiple gene duplications, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> successive
          rounds of genome duplications that may have occurred near
          the base of the vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chordates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
          Drosophila are all physically
          linked to 
          runt on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome, and were
          almost certainly generated by local gene duplication
          events (for the location of the 
          Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, see FlyBase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genome Browser</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bdgp</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/cgi-bin/annot/gbrowse</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> newly
          discovered 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Runx</ENAMEX> genes both contain
          a complete open reading frame encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and conserved exon-intron structure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1and
          Supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), suggesting that they are probably
          not pseudogenes. This is further supported by our finding
          that each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mosquito <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> has an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologue</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Figs. 1, 2, and 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Alternative promoter usage among vertebrate runx
          genes
          All of the vertebrate Runx genes are transcribed from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX> (distal) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX> (proximal).
          We found no evidence (as would be indicated by cDNA
          clones or ESTs) in the database for alternative promoter
          usage among any of the invertebrate Runx genes examined,
          suggesting that alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> may have evolved in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chordate</ENAMEX> lineage leading to vertebrates, subsequent
          to its divergence from urochordates. All known
          invertebrate Runx gene products begin with long <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'UTRs
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX> that are more like
          those of the products from the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P2</NUMEX>) of
          the vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P2</ENAMEX> is the primitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. Definitive resolution of these issues awaits a
          more comprehensive database of genomes and expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in appropriate invertebrate systems. Figure
          4Adepicts the transcript structures generated by
          alternative promoter usage and splicing in the vertebrate
          Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Bshows</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> derived from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. It is clear from
          these data that the usage of alternative promoters
          evolved prior to the gene duplication events in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">vertebrate</ENAMEX> lineage, since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in both mouse
          and 
          Takifugu utilize alternative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that give rise to similar alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-termini
          within the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologues</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) In the public databases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain is
        currently found only in sequences from bilaterians. This
        suggests that it may be a metazoan (and possibly a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bilaterian</ENAMEX>) invention, and that the genomic regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> through which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runx</ENAMEX> genes control the fate,
        proliferation and differentiation of cells are unique to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) The primitive condition in bilaterians is most
        likely a single Runx gene, represented in the deuterostomes
        of our collection by the sea urchin 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> purpuratus and the tunicate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> intestinalis , and in the
        protostomes of our collection by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . Runx gene duplications
        appear to have occurred independently in the lineages
        leading to vertebrates (which have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> Runx
        genes) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> (which have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Runx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>),
        suggesting that Runx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in these latter organisms have
        probably acquired a number of specialized, taxon-specific
        regulatory functions (e.g., segmentation in arthropods [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        ] , bone development in vertebrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , etc.). Thus,
        studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Runx genes</ENAMEX> in sea urchins, tunicates, and
        nematodes are likely to highlight primitive, pan-bilaterian
        regulatory functions of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of genes in the cell
        biology of animal development.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) The ancestral bilaterian Runx gene was apparently
        assembled from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons and contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> introns, one
        within the sequence that encodes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain, and a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> that borders the sequence encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) The ancestor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vertebrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runx</ENAMEX> genes
        utilized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> that generate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alternative N</ENAMEX>-terminal sequences.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Collection and assembly of previously
          uncharacterised runx genes
          The 
          Ciona intestinalis Runx gene was
          assembled with sequence files obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trace</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archive</ENAMEX> database. A "seed" sequence was found in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> intestinalis gDNA, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ti 119616831</ENAMEX>
          ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplemental Table 1</ENAMEX>), by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MegaBLAST</ENAMEX> search using
          nucleotide sequence encoding exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpRunt</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI Trace</ENAMEX> server
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">site http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/blast/mmtrace.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. A
          translation of the seed sequence also showed significant
          similarity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> sequence showing
          Runx homology was in turn used as the query to obtain
          overlapping sequence and those obtained replaced the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX>. This repetitive BLAST process was continued such
          that the seed sequence was extended <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 kb</TIMEX> in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' direction relative to the coding orientation of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX>. The intron position assignments were aided by
          an alignment of the acquired 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> intestinalis Runx gene with
          partial cDNA sequences obtained from a TBLASTN search
          using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. purpuratus SpRunt</ENAMEX>-1 protein
          sequence to query the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> intestinalis cDNA project site
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX>ghost.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zool</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kyoto-u.ac.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">jp/indexr1.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. Introns
          in those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the gene upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runt</ENAMEX> domain,
          not found in any cDNA, were manually assigned by spliced
          alignment, maintaining maximum homologue similarity.
          Specifically, putative introns were located by searching
          for the termini of open reading frames, and then
          positioned in such a way that the resulting open reading
          frame had maximum similarity to that of a homologous gene
          while the intron-exon junctions had the expected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">consensus 5'GT/-AG-3</ENAMEX>' sequence. A known intron in a
          similar position in an orthologous gene was considered a
          validation of correct position assignment. Highly
          conserved sequence blocks or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, such as the Runt
          domain or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groucho</ENAMEX>-binding site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VWRPY</ENAMEX>,
          served as anchoring reference points. Multiple
          overlapping sequences in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> intestinalis contig provided a
          confidence in the final sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Close
          inspection of the sequence alignments showed no variation
          among high confidence regions of the sequence where high
          confidence regions means <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 40-50</NUMEX> nucleotides from
          the end of the read or with few unassigned base calls
          near the region. The complete absence of sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, the multiple sequence coverage, and the high
          sequence quality all indicate that no additional Runx
          genes are present in the

          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CG1379 and CG15455</TIMEX>) are present in a single sequence

          RunxB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was found despite an
          extensive search, so putative intron positions were
          manually located in these genes by spliced alignment as
          described above. Unlike all of the deuterostome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          the positions of introns among the insect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> to the nucleotide, and were thus assigned with
          less confidence and should hence be considered
          provisional.

          TrRunx2 ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplemental Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The promoter structure of

          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] during the course of our study, was in agreement
          with our results.
          In addition to the gene sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> published
          partial cDNA sequences from a spider ( 
          Cupiennius salei ) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an EST</TIMEX> from
          a nematode ( 
          Meloidogyne hapla ) were obtained
          from the NCBI database and used in the multiple sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX>. Since the nematode sequence and one of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">spider</ENAMEX> sequences ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">run-2</ENAMEX> ) only contain part of the
          runt domain, these were not used in the phylogenetic
          analysis.
