        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX> predisposes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to bacterial
        and fungal infections, including those caused by 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        have suggested that vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) occurs
        more frequently in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Further,
        chronic recurring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX> may be a marker of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Several studies report increased rates of asymptomatic
        vaginal carriage rates of 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">symptomatic</ENAMEX> infection in diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, but results are
        inconsistent [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 10 11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . While some show no
        increase in carriage of vaginal 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candida</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , those demonstrating
        increased 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> in female diabetes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do not examine the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> control or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes type</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 14</NUMEX> ] . However, 
        in vitro studies demonstrating
        impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> response directed against 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candida</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> support the idea
        of increased rates of 
        Candida colonization among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Whether diabetes leads to more symptomatic
        and/or more recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">VVC</ENAMEX> episodes is a subject of
        controversy.
        Potential risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes type</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">severity</ENAMEX>, and degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> control. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ]
        In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>, a number of VVC risk
        factors have been identified, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] , previous history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ,
        higher education degree, intermediate age, oral
        contraceptive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 10 16 18</ENAMEX> ] , use of commercially
        available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> for cleansing of external genitalia or
        vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">douching</ENAMEX>, frequent sexual intercourse [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 19 10</NUMEX> ]
        , sexual behavior (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first intercourse, frequency of
        oral-genital contact) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , contraception devices
        (diaphragm, vaginal contraceptive sponge, intrauterine
        device), and antibiotics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 15 19</ENAMEX> ] . Whether these
        factors increase risk of 
        Candida colonization or symptomatic
        infection following colonization, or both, is unknown,
        however, it should be emphasized that a prerequisite for
        symptomatic vaginitis is vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colonization</ENAMEX>.
        Few studies have addressed the relationship between 
        Candida colonization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes</ENAMEX>; none we are aware of have examined the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behavioral VVC</ENAMEX> risk factors for colonization among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. To evaluate the relationship between 
        Candida colonization and hypothesized
        risk factors for vulvovaginal candidiasis colonization in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX>, we conducted a cross-sectional study among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">female diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving care at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes clinics</ENAMEX>. We describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between 
        Candida colonization,
        sociodemographics, health behaviors, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes type</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes severity</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hemoglobin A</ENAMEX> 
        1c level among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
        type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study population
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Female diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen at an outpatient
          academic diabetes practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal</ENAMEX>
          Medicine, were eligible for study. The practice included
          an urban (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Health Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>) clinic
          and a suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hechtman Clinic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bingham Farms</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were diagnosed with type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and type 2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes</ENAMEX> on clinical presentation by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> certified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endocrinologist</ENAMEX>. Potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were approached
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and consent obtained. As an
          incentive for participation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were rewarded with
          video rental gift certificates (value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
          consented to a medical record review which included
          abstraction of total glycated hemoglobin levels obtained
          at the enrollment visit, completed a self-administered
          questionnaire and self-collected a vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">swab</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX> addressed the following variables:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sociodemographic</ENAMEX> (age, race, marital status, insurance
          status, highest education completed, occupation);
          diabetes duration, type, severity, and abnormal glucose
          level; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> diagnosed VVC
          episodes; recent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use, by type; sexual history;
          health behaviors. For the diabetes section we used
          questions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetes Care Profile</ENAMEX>, an instrument
          developed and validated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Diabetes Research</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training Center</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . The study protocol was
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Boards</ENAMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX>.
          Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> approached, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67.7%</NUMEX>) consented. One
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woman</ENAMEX> was ineligible because her vaginal sample was lost.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> decided to stop participating during the study;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> did not understand the questionnaire, while the other
          felt the questionnaire was too intrusive, leaving a final
          sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Laboratory methods
          All vaginal specimens were cultured for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>.
          Specimens were placed on plates with media selective for 
          Candida growth (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabouraud</ENAMEX>'s
          dextrose agar). Suspected mixed samples, as determined by
          colony type and microscopic characteristics, were placed
          on plates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> showing species-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> change (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromagar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHROMagar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> glabrata were identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlamydospore</ENAMEX> and germ tube tests; all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were
          identified by carbohydrate assimilation tests (API-20C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUX</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          We described the distributions of hypothesized
          variables among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, using simple descriptive
          statistics, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between hypothesized
          risk factors and 
          Candida colonization using odds
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ratios</ENAMEX> (OR) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cornfield</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals (CI).
          After a detailed stratified analysis, to assess
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confounding</ENAMEX> and effect modification, we fit a logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> model for 
          Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>. We calculated ORS
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIs</ENAMEX> for the bivariate analyses using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EpiInfo</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
          ] ; all other analyses and data management were done
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Several variables strongly associated
          with 
          Candida colonization had small
          numbers of missing values, particularly for oral sex
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) and douching (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>) (others did not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>). In
          this case, for the multivariate analyses, we inferred
          that a missing response was equivalent to a negative
          response. If we are wrong in this inference, the
          resulting estimates will be biased towards the null
          hypothesis of no effect. Excluding the missing responses
          from the relevant analyses only modestly changed the
          point estimates.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Demographic characteristics by clinic
          Fifty-nine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHC</ENAMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hechtman</ENAMEX>. Mean age among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52.3 years</TIMEX>, while mean age among
          Hechtman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50.0 years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>). The
          clinics varied greatly, however, in participant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethnicity</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty of fifty-nine</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67.8%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          were of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> descent. By contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.0%</NUMEX>) Hechtman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African American</ENAMEX>
          descent.
        
        
          Diabetes characteristics
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62/101</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>).
          By <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>, type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was more common among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX>), but was equally distributed among Hechtman
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
          Total glycated hemoglobin levels measured at the time
          of the enrollment visit were abstracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          charts. We assessed glycemia by transforming total
          glycated hemoglobin levels to hemoglobin A1c (HbA 
          1c ) values using a linear regression
          formula [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . For the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX> patient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, a value of HbA 
          1c > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.4%</NUMEX> is abnormal. This
          cutpoint was determined by standard clinical laboratory
          comparison methods and verification of the reference
          interval [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] . The mean HbA 
          1c for our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.91</NUMEX>,
          with a range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.7</NUMEX>. Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.8%</NUMEX>) had normal HbA 
          1c at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of enrollment. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Type 1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a higher proportion of abnormal levels
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92.3%</NUMEX>) than type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.6%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Correlates of Candidacolonization
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">101</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.7%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were colonized with 
          Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9%</NUMEX>)
          were colonized with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
          Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The most common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12/29</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.4%</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> glabrata (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11/29</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.9%</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans predominated among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with type 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/16</NUMEX> colonized or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> glabrata among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> 2
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/13</NUMEX> colonized or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>). We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> isolate of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> parapsilosis, C.
          guilliermondii, and 
          Trichosporon beigelli. 
          Type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were more likely to be colonized with 
          Candida than type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (OR =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.98</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abnormal HbA</ENAMEX> 
          1c were almost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times more likely
          to be colonized with 
          Candida than those with normal HBA 
          1c , but this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was not
          statistically significant (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.68</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.39</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.13</NUMEX>). No statistically significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was
          detected between 
          Candida colonization and duration
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, although those who were colonized in each
          diabetic type tended to have longer duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
          (mean duration <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, colonized v. not: type <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1: 15.7</TIMEX>

          Average duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> among colonized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> did
          not differ by type (type <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1: 20.2</TIMEX> v. type <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2: 16.1</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.53</NUMEX>).
          Age, race, marital status, education, and employment
          were not significantly associated with 
          Candida colonization (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibiotic</ENAMEX> use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 2 weeks</TIMEX>, lifetime history of
          chlamydia, douching, and report of both performing and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with 
          Candida colonization, whereas
          vaginal-penile sex had only a modest and not
          statistically significant assocation with 
          Candida colonization. When
          stratified by oral sex, there was no association between
          vaginal sex and colonization status. However, the effect
          of oral sex remained after stratification by vaginal
          sex.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multivariate Analyses</ENAMEX>
          To simultaneously adjust for variables independently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with 
          Candida colonization in the crude
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, we fit a logistic regression model predicting 
          Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Because
          of the small sample size, we created a base model
          including age, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes type</ENAMEX>, abnormal HbA 
          1c , recent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use, and
          performing oral sex. We assumed for this analysis that
          those who did not respond to questions about oral sex did
          not engage in oral sex. Receiving oral sex was not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> after adjustment for performing oral sex (OR =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.07</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.42</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>) and thus was
          excluded from the base model. Other variables associated
          in the bivariate analyses were added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at a time to the
          base model. After adjustment, older age, having type 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, an abnormal HbA 
          1c level, and report of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 2 weeks</TIMEX> were statistically
          significantly associated with 
          Candida colonization. Performing
          oral sex was associated with an almost fivefold increase
          in colonization, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was not
          statistically significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>). When added
          individually to the base model, lifetime history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlamydia</ENAMEX> (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.9</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.54</NUMEX>) but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">douching</ENAMEX> (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 %</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.68</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.00</NUMEX>) remained
          strongly associated with colonization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          positive for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candida</ENAMEX> also had a previous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chlamydia</ENAMEX> diagnosis and reported douching. When entered
          simultaneously into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the estimates were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unstable</ENAMEX>, thus, they were entered separately. Douching
          and history of chlamydia were also strongly associated
          with performing oral sex; adding each of these variables
          reduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the parameter</TIMEX> estimate and statistical
          significance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with performing oral sex.
          Pregnancy history had no association with colonization
          after adjustment (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.66</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, 
        Candida carriage increased with older
        age, type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, abnormal HbA 
        1c level, oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use in the
        previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>, and ever history of chlamydia. Other
        VVC risk factors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> descent,
        lifetime history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX>, higher education, oral
        contraceptive use, and frequency of vaginal intercourse
        were not significantly associated with 
        Candida colonization after adjustment
        for other variables. These data suggest that behavioral
        factors, as well as HbA 
        1c , are important determinants of 
        Candida colonization among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> had higher 
        Candida colonization rates than those
        with type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, even after adjusting for age, behavioral
        factors and HbA 
        1c . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation is
        difference in duration of 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with type 1
        and type 2 diabetes may be equally likely to acquire 
        Candida, but those with type 1 may be
        less able to clear it. Similar to previous reports, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans was isolated from the
        majority of colonized type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, while 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> glabrata was the most common
        isolate in type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, but our numbers are small [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] . Whether this is due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes type</ENAMEX> or reflects
        different distributions of 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> by age or both is
        uncertain.
        The observation that hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes
        increases risk for 
        Candida colonization is consistent
        with previous reports [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 5 6 31</NUMEX> ] . A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> study of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with type 1 diabetes found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        elevated glycated hemoglobin reported vaginal symptoms for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> overall [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Hyperglycemia limits neutrophil function among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
        type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neutrophils</ENAMEX>' ability to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phagocytose</ENAMEX> and kill 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. With the oxidative
        killing ability of neutrophils hindered, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> may not
        be able to clear pathogens as well as non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 6 7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . Hyperglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may also have increased
        risk for 
        Candida colonization because their
        secretions contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, which can serve as nutrients
        for 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sobel</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> reported a fucose (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-deoxy-galactose</NUMEX>) vaginal
        epithelial cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aids</ENAMEX> in adhesion of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candida</ENAMEX> to vaginal epithelial cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . Since fucose contains an isomer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and acts
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> site for 
        Candida adhesion, it is possible that
        increased 
        Candida colonization is proportional
        to glucose level. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Receptor avidity</ENAMEX> may be a reflection of
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and tissues.
        Glycemia, however, does not fully explain the observed
        increased risk of 
        Candida colonization.
        We found a borderline significant association with
        performing oral sex associated with an almost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in vaginal colonization with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candida</ENAMEX>. Receiving but not performing
        oral sex has been previously reported as a risk factor for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Oral sex may facilitate transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
        as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candida</ENAMEX> often colonizes the oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavity</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 33</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Diabetics</ENAMEX> may be more likely to carry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candida</ENAMEX> in the oral cavity than their sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>; thus,
        performing oral sex on their sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> prior to vaginal
        intercourse may serve to inoculate the vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cavity</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douching</ENAMEX> has also been previously associated with 
        Candida colonization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        The practice is hypothesized to disrupt vaginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>;
        vaginal symptoms may also lead a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to douche so the
        direction of effect is unclear. The association we observed
        with chlamydia is probably a marker of sexual behavior
        rather than a causal factor; for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
        reported a history of chlamydia were more likely to douche
        and to report engaging in oral sex, although it is possible
        that chlamydia carriage adversely affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vaginal flora</ENAMEX>
        increasing the chance of 
        Candida colonization. Recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use is a well-described correlate of symptomatic
        
        Candida vaginitis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 15 16 17 18 34</NUMEX>
        ] . While asymptomatic infection is not equivalent to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use may act to alter the vaginal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX> to facilitate 
        Candida colonization in the same way
        it is hypothesized to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 years</TIMEX> and older in our study were more
        likely to be colonized with 
        Candida <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. We are unaware of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colonization</ENAMEX> studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of comparable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>; most have
        emphasized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of childbearing age [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 35 36</ENAMEX> ] . Whether
        our observation is a real finding or a reflection of our
        age distribution (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-84</NUMEX>) or unknown selection biases which
        led to inclusion in our study requires further
        investigation. However, incidence of symptomatic infection
        is higher in younger (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-44</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        This study is small and was intended to be hypothesis
        generating. The study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is in no way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, although the
        age and racial distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> reflected that
        of the participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>. Although it is possible that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with a history of symptomatic infection might have
        been more likely to participate, we have no reason to
        believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> differentially participated by both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symptomatic</ENAMEX> history and other variables under study which
        would have biased our results. Further, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were
        unaware of whether they carried 
        Candida at the time of completing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">questionnaire</ENAMEX>, it seems unlikely that a differential recall
        of behaviors among colonized and non-colonized might have
        occurred. A final concern is that 
        Candida colonization, while the first
        step toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVC</ENAMEX>, is not equivalent to symptomatic
        infection. Larger, more definitive studies, which include a
        non-diabetic control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and prospective follow-up, are
        planned.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We found strong, statistically significant associations
        between vaginal 
        Candida colonization and antibiotic
        use, lifetime history of chlamydia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes type</ENAMEX> and HbA 
        1c level and a borderline significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with performing oral sex. More 
        non-albicans <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were observed
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Improving glucose control
        and possibly modifying sexual behavior may reduce risk of 
        Candida colonization, and potentially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">symptomatic</ENAMEX> infection, among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
