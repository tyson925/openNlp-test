        The saturation status of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is
        relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of jaundice
        and to interpreting experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>, in
        its diacid form (H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>), has a low solubility (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubility</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) at any pH is determined by S

        Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> reported the use
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13C-NMR</ENAMEX> to study the ionization of a close analogue of
        bilirubin-IXÎ±, mesobilirubin-XIIIÎ± (MBR), along with
        several soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reference acids</ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">buffered</NUMEX> mixtures of (C
        2H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . Due to
        the very low aqueous solubility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>, data were obtained
        only at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> high concentrations of (C 2H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 and 27 vol%</NUMEX>). Its pK

          values in "water" (actually in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 vol%</NUMEX> of ((C 2H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX>), obtained by an extrapolation
        procedure based on the behavior of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reference acids</ENAMEX>,
        were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2 and 4.9</NUMEX>, far lower than values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.12</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.44</NUMEX>
        obtained by solvent partition between chloroform and
        buffered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aqueous solutions</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        These serious discrepancies led us to reexamine several
        experimental aspects of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">13C</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> studies and the
        implications of their purported low pK

        to failure to correct for the strong effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> on the

        and acknowledged [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, as discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, a
        thermodynamic theory about solubility in mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX>,
        using the S 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> nM in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX> in pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , suggested that S 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> would be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only about 0.15 Î¼M</NUMEX> in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 vol%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.2 Î¼M</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 vol%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>, which are well
        below concentrations used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> studies. This implies
        serious supersaturation effects. In fact, turbidity was
        reported for some of the systems used in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">13C</NUMEX>-NMR papers
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , indicating the formation of coarse suspensions. By
        definition, as stressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conclusions</ENAMEX> section, pK 
        
          a  
          determinations are valid only for monomeric species
        and require that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> are below <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saturation</ENAMEX> at all pH
        values studied. Even reversible aggregation of monomers in
        undersaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> is known to affect pK 
        
          a  
          estimates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . If supersaturation leads to the
        formation of fine sols or coarse suspensions, the data are
        unacceptable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the pK 
        
          a  
          values of monomers.
        In the present paper, we assess whether some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> used in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">13C</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> studies were supersaturated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>. Our experimental work on sedimentation was done
        with unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO</ENAMEX> instead
        of its deuterated analogue, (C 2H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX>. It is known that, when alkaline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aqueous UCB</ENAMEX> is acidified to neutral or low pH's, "Usually a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">colloid</TIMEX> suspension of bilirubin is formed and the solution
        remains clear, as observed by the naked eye, thus inviting
        an erroneous interpretation" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Such systems, which
        simulate true solutions, often show sedimentation on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . We here report that
        sedimentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> from apparently clear solutions can
        likewise be extensive when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> is diluted with
        aqueous buffers to final mole fractions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>, corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 vol%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>. A thermodynamic theory is used to examine the
        effect of added <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> on S 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  . Our findings, consistent with our
        partition-derived S 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and pK 
        
          a  
          values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> in aqueous buffers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , indicate that
        the recently reported low pK 
        
          a  
          values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> in comparable (C 2H

          Deviations of their ratio below unity (dotted lines)

          progressive rise in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] as one moved down the column of
          fluid. By contrast, after dilution with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1/8th</TIMEX> volume of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> to decrease UCB saturation, the supernatants
          produced no further sedimentation and there were no
          significant differences in [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] or protein
          concentrations along the axis of the fluid column. Thus,
          the UCB-HSA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, which constitutes over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> in this system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , did not sediment.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Findings and their relation to thermodynamic
          theory
          Supersaturated aqueous systems of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>, that are
          optically clear before centrifugation, may exhibit
          considerable variation in the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sedimentation</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 18</NUMEX> ] . Although sedimentation is often
          extensive, it is generally incomplete and may not be
          observed at all. Our data in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO-water</ENAMEX> show the same
          features, which are expected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> kinetics of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleation</ENAMEX> and growth of insoluble aggregates of UCB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diacid</ENAMEX> (H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>), leading to the formation of a
          new solid phase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Our centrifugation, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> at
          14,000 
          g  , was quite mild, and the short
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> period between preparation of UCB-DMSO-water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and centrifugation severely limited the
          time-dependent growth to large aggregates. Lack of
          sedimentation of the UCB-HSA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (mol. wt. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68,000</NUMEX>)
          indicates that fine colloids composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> UCB
          molecules would be too small to sediment. Thus,
          supersaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> lacking coarse, insoluble
          aggregates may not show sedimentation, but any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sedimentation</ENAMEX> observed indicates their presence.
          To evaluate the important effect of pH on
          sedimentation efficiency, we calculated S in water using
          chloroform-water partition data on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> and the best
          measure of S 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  in chloroform, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.88</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . S at
          any pH, e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> nM at pH <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7.4 and 0.32 Î</NUMEX>¼M at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>, can
          be calculated from the fitted partition data, or,
          equivalently, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, using the partition-derived S 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  in water of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> nM and pK 
          
            a  
            values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.12 and 8.44</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In aqueous systems [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] , the lowest [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, below which no
          sedimentation was observed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> Ã— 
          g  for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM at pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, modestly higher than our partition-derived S of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Even under such vigorous centrifugation, the
          lowest [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] increased rapidly with increasing pH, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼M</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> times S) at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.05</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> times S) at pH
          8.2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . This indicates increasing
          charge-stabilization of fine, non-sedimenting colloids of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>  B by adsorbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 19 20</NUMEX>
          ] . In contrast, below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pH 6.7</NUMEX>, sedimentation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> UCB
          was nearly complete [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This is compatible with a
          dearth of stabilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> anions at this pH, as expected
          from the high pK 
          
            a  
            values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.12 and 8.44</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          Our present data on residual [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] in DMSO-water
          systems likewise show decreased sedimentation with
          increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,1C</ENAMEX>). At each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>  , the lowest [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] were at the
          lowest pH values: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.15</NUMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> Î¼M (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> &<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#956</NUMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX>).
          As in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, these are likely to be closest to the S 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  values at each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Indeed</ENAMEX>, they are
          only moderately higher than the corresponding S

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 2</ENAMEX> is a thermodynamic relationship based on

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, a roughly linear variation of log S 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> at low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> is expected. For
          example, data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-naphthoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO-water</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
          show that log S 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  is a linear function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX>. Such a relationship leads to a relatively small
          effect of low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> values on S 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  . Thus, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Equation 2</ENAMEX>, S 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  increases by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1.4</NUMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX>, but by a relatively
          larger factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>. This would markedly
          reduce the supersaturation factor ([<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/ S</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  ), which is a measure of the
          tendency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> to come out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>. This
          explains in part the relatively high [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] at high pH at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A).
          The pH effects on [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] at each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>  are of interest also. The lowest
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] at each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pH</ENAMEX> registered relatively small increases
          with significant increases in pH: for example from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH 4.14</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 Î¼M</NUMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>; from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH 4.5</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.4 Î¼M</NUMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX>; and from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">111 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH 7.1</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">166 Î¼M</NUMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.4</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>. These increases
          are probably caused mainly by increasing
          charge-stabilization of colloidal aggregates, as in
          aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 19 20</NUMEX> ] . If, instead, the relatively
          small increases are ascribed entirely to increases in
          true solubility (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>) at the high pH (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the required
          pK 
          
            a  
            values are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 7</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>. The true pK 
          
            a  
            s of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO-water</ENAMEX> are thus probably
          significantly higher.
          We note that some variability in sedimentation results
          from our short-term experiments, most evident at the low
          residual [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Band 1C</ENAMEX>, in part magnified by
          the log-log scale used. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> is expected,
          however, because of the complexity of the kinetic
          processes of nucleation, growth and flocculation that
          precede sedimentation. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A, the difference between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris</ENAMEX> buffers is quite small (note the linear
          scale), compatible with the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX> higher [H +] in the
          acetate buffer. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, the markedly lower
          sedimentation from phosphate buffers at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.7</NUMEX>, as
          compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris</ENAMEX> buffer at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1</NUMEX>, can be ascribed mainly
          to the much higher pH values and ionic strength of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> systems. Another significant factor may be the
          difference in charge between the buffer salts; phosphate
          is anionic whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris</ENAMEX> is cationic and zwitterionic. The
          cationic species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris</ENAMEX> can, in principle, reduce the
          negative charges on the surface of the colloidal H 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>  B sufficiently to facilitate the
          formation of coarser particles and, thus, increase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sedimentation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Implications for pK a values of mesobilirubin-XIIIÎ±
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>)
          In the recent 13C-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> studies of the ionization of the
          13C-COOH <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] , it was assumed that
          the relevant physical properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>, and of
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX> (DMSO) and (C 2H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX>, are similar. Actually, as
          expected from the replacement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vinyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in UCB
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ethyl groups</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> is slightly more
          soluble in organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and has a higher R 
          f  on silica <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gel t.l.c.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> is
          thus more hydrophobic and should be less soluble in water
          than is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>. Our low [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] in DMSO-water systems at
          comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, therefore, indicate that many of the (C 2H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>  SO/buffer systems used in the
          13C-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] were likely supersaturated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>. In those studies, the MBR concentrations used
          were stated to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 to 100 Î</NUMEX>¼M at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.086</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ,
          compared to our lowest [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.3 Î</NUMEX>¼M at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>
          Î¼M at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.05</NUMEX>. At this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> data points were
          obtained at pH below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.05 and 5 below</NUMEX> pH 4.5 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , so
          that even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M MBR was likely to be supersaturated. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>, our lowest [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.8 Î</NUMEX>¼M at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX>, was close to
          the lower limit of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 800 Î¼M</NUMEX> range of [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>] used [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . Thus, many data points, obtained at pH values
          down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , were probably from supersaturated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, despite being optically clear. As noted here and
          elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16 18</NUMEX> ] , optical clarity gives
          no assurance of the absence of supersaturation.
          Actually, turbidity was reported in some of the
          13C-NMR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , indicating that coarse, insoluble
          aggregates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> were present. The claim that such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">turbidity</ENAMEX> did not affect 13C-NMR measurements [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5 6</NUMEX> ]
          contrasts with evidence that even small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multimers</ENAMEX> can
          change <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> chemical shifts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . It should be noted
          also that, at high concentrations of B =, extensive,
          reversible self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of B =can lead to apparently
          stable supersaturation with no separation of an insoluble
          phase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . For example, at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> and a UCB
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼M</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> times S), the weight-average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aggregation</ENAMEX> number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> has been found to be 7.17 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          ] , corresponding to a molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,195</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aggregation</ENAMEX> number remained fairly high, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">w/v</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The successful application of
          equilibrium ultracentrifugation for that study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
          suggests a complete absence of even small colloidal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>. Self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> dianions in (C 2H
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> mixtures cannot be ruled
          out on 
          a priori  grounds. It has been shown
          that neglect of self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of B =leads to an
          artefactually low estimate of pK 
          
            a  
            values for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          In addition to the problems of insolubility,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supersaturation</ENAMEX> and self-aggregation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> systems
          in (C 2H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] , we had shown
          previously that inaccuracies in the pH measurements
          affected both the magnitude of Î”pK

          of the variation of Î”pK 
          
            a  
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . This is important for extrapolating
          pK 
          
            a  
            values in (C 2H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>  ) 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2  SO</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>).
          Indeed, remeasurement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> raised its pK 
          
            a  
            by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inaccuracies</ENAMEX> in pH measurement produced serious errors in
          reported pK 
          
            a  
            values of more than fifteen soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> used as
          models for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX>, as well as for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> itself [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ]
          .
          Many methods, using appropriate pH measurements, have
          been applied in the past to determine thermodynamic pK 
          
            a  
            values of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in non-aqueous or partially
          aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO-water</ENAMEX> systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] .
          Many other relevant references were given in our prior
          paper [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . In that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, our pK 
          
            a  
            measurements on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetic acid</ENAMEX> in DMSO-water systems
          were based on the potentiometric method, using properly
          calibrated glass electrodes, which determine the activity
          of H +, and on estimates of the activity coefficients of
          the acetate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ion</ENAMEX>. This method, which is well established
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">aqueous</TIMEX> solutions, yielded results in good agreement
          with data from the literature that was based on a very
          different method, measurements of electrical conductivity
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13C</TIMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>, therefore, it was not
          justified, to assume that pH values do not change on
          adding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] , or to use uncalibrated pH
          measurements for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the pK 
          
            a

          Our sedimentation data and their interpretation
          indicate that significant additional uncertainties, not
          important for the soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> investigated, exist for
          the reported pK

        Conclusions
        The present sedimentation data for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> in DMSO-water
        demonstrate that the true solubilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>, even at
        fairly high pH values, are low at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> mole fractions up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.31</NUMEX>. The results and related considerations are compatible
        with similar results in purely aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX>
        ] , and support both the estimated solubility (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX>  ) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> for uncharged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> (H
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and the corresponding
        high aqueous pK

        studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . These were performed in undersaturated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and took into account the self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of B =.
        Our experimental data indicate problems of insolubility,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supersaturation</ENAMEX> and self-aggregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> in DMSO-water
        mixtures with compositions similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBR</ENAMEX> systems in (C

        involved in the stated equilibria, and require unambiguous
        determination of [H +] or pH. Unless pK 
        
          a  
          values are determined for monomeric systems, relative
        concentrations of H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>  A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> -and A =cannot be determined
        from the pK

        every system was below <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saturation</ENAMEX> and not self-associated [

          Test systems (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.0 mL</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> were prepared in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicate</ENAMEX>: to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> mL of the stock buffer were added
          successively the appropriate volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> and,
          finally, up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 Î¼L</NUMEX> of stock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB/DMSO</ENAMEX> solution. To
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minimize UCB</ENAMEX> oxidation, all tubes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> were
          deoxygenated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argon</ENAMEX> and kept in the dark [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . To

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrophotometrically</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> min. The precipitates
          were washed once with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> mL of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, again centrifuged,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> aspirated, and the packed precipitate dissolved
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> for spectrophotometry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absorbance</ENAMEX> ( 
          A  ) was measured in triplicate at

          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX> dissolved in each system. The variability is in
          part due to degradation, discussed above, and in part due
          to the low absorbances at [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>] below the saturation
          limit in some buffer/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> systems. For these reasons, no
          corrections were made for these minor differences in

          Sedimentation of bilirubin-albumin complexes
          To determine if UCB bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSA</ENAMEX> would sediment, we

          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min yielded a small amount of precipitated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCB</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> aliquots of the clear supernatant were diluted with
