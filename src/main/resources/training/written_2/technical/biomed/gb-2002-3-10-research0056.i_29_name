        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organisms</ENAMEX> must be able to respond to their environment
        to survive. In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, mechanisms have evolved for sensing
        and responding to hormonal and environmental signals, both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotic</ENAMEX> (for example, pathogens) and abiotic (for example,
        heat, cold, light and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>/drought stresses). To elicit a
        response, the perceived signal must be conveyed to the
        cellular machinery. Messengers such as Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, cyclic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> and cGMP), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> (H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> transduce the
        perceived stimulus to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that initiate a response. Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is one of the important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> that mediate plant
        responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, developmental cues and external
        stimuli [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>]. It is implicated in regulating such
        diverse and fundamental cellular process as cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streaming</ENAMEX>, thigmotropism, gravitropism, cell division, cell
        elongation, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell polarity</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photomorphogenesis</ENAMEX> and plant defense and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> responses [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. The Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration in the cytoplasm ([Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyt</ENAMEX> ) is maintained in the nanomolar
        range (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 100-200 nM</TIMEX>), whereas the concentration
        in organelles and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall</ENAMEX> is in the millimolar range [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Several signals (hormonal, abiotic and biotic)
        have been shown to cause transient elevation of [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyt</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. This transient
        increase in [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyt</ENAMEX> is sensed by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding proteins
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. The conformation of the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding protein
        changes on binding Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, resulting in modulation of its
        activity or its ability to interact with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or
        nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and modulate their function or activity. The
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+sensors in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> can be broadly divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        major classes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 9</ENAMEX>]: calmodulin (CAM) (class A), CAM-like
        and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing Ca 2</ENAMEX>+-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (class
        B), Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> (class C) and Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> without EF-hand motifs (class <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> classes (A, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>) contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
        EF-hand motifs. This motif is a helix-loop-helix structure
        that binds a single Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The loop consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        residues with the pattern <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">X*Y*Z*-Y*-X**-Z</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">residues X</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-Y, -X</ENAMEX>, -Z participate in binding Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intervening residues</ENAMEX> are represented by asterisks (*). Asp
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asn</ENAMEX> is usually found at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y; Asp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Asn, or Ser at Z</ENAMEX>;
        a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Y</NUMEX>; usually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asp, Asn</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">-X</ENAMEX>, but this position is more variable; and usually Glu at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Z</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. The helix-loop-helix is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> long,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E Î±</ENAMEX>-helix being <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-10</ENAMEX>, the loop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-21</NUMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F Î±-helix 19-29</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Residue 1</ENAMEX> is often <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>), and a
        Gly at residue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> is highly conserved, as is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ile</ENAMEX> at residue
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>. It has been reported that some of the EF-hand domains
        do not bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        In quiescent cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with EF-hands are in an
        apoprotein form; when [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+] 
        cyt increases they bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and change
        their conformation. Some EF-hands can also bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+(for
        example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third and fourth</TIMEX> EF-hands of troponin C bind
        Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+/Mg <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> EF-hands are Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+specific [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]). Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+/Mg <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+discrimination relies on the
        affinities of the EF-hands for these cations, which is
        dependent on the types of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX> in the
        binding loop [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 13</TIMEX>].
        EF-hands can be present in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with no other known
        domains, as is the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX>, or in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with other
        domains such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>. In most cases EF-hand
        motifs are found in pairs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> EF-hands
        usually have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains with a pair of EF-hands in each.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calpain</ENAMEX> is an exception to the pairing rule. It comprises a
        large subunit with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> EF-hands at the carboxyl terminus
        and a small subunit that also has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> EF-hands. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        unpaired hands in these subunits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> to form a heterodimer
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The large superfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has been
        divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> subfamilies on the basis of differences in
        number and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of EF-hand pairs, amino-acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> within or outside the motifs, affinity for Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and/or selectivity and affinity for target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. Of the subfamilies, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> consist of a unique single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> used in the classification by
        Nakayama 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, fungi and protists, with plants
        represented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only nine of the 66</TIMEX> subfamilies.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EF-hand proteins</ENAMEX> have been identified in the
        model plant 
        Arabidopsis thaliana, including
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17, 18</TIMEX>], a Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding protein
        (CaBP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>)[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], touch-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins TCH2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TCH3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> (CPKs) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>], calcineurin B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins/salt</ENAMEX>-overly-sensitive3
        family (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBLs/SOS3</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>], fimbrins [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], respiratory
        burst oxidase homologs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rbohs</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>], a phospholipase [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>], channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>], a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>)-dependent
        glutamate dehydrogenase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>], a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NaCl</ENAMEX>-inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], and a Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Some have been identified by
        screening with animal homologs whereas others have been
        identified by sequencing the genes induced in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotic</ENAMEX> and abiotic signals. The first method would miss
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plant-specific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> method
        relies on comprehensive analysis of all genes that might be
        induced or activated by various signals. With the recent
        completion of the sequencing of the 
        A. thaliana genome, the first plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> to be sequenced, new methods of identifying genes
        encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with specific domains have become
        possible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insight</ENAMEX> into the function of the proteins
        can be gained by identifying and characterizing EF-hand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins encoded</ENAMEX> in the 
        Arabidopsis genome. Classification of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be a starting point in
        identification of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that might be
        involved in a particular cell process. With this in mind,
        we searched the 
        Arabidopsis genome for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with EF-hand motifs. We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> approaches to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">identify EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. First, we analyzed data
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Center for Protein</ENAMEX> Sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX>) 
        A. thaliana database (MAtDB) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>]; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, we carried out BLAST searches using different
        known <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand sequences</ENAMEX> (nucleotide and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) against
        the 
        Arabidopsis genome database and
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, we searched the literature. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>
        EF-hand or putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This estimate
        represents a maximum number of possible EF-hand-containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the 
        Arabidopsis genome as our analysis
        was very inclusive. Of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 47</NUMEX> have
        been reported in the literature. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> were
        identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> prediction program as having an
        EF-hand and the rest were identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
        programs. Further study is needed to verify Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding
        activity of many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Each protein sequence
        was analyzed for domains other than EF-hands. Several have
        a variety of domains, which may be useful in determining
        protein function.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Identification of EF-hand-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>
          To identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
          Arabidopsis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
          listed as having EF-hands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">InterPro Domain Table</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAtDB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] were retrieved. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX> was
          then analyzed for the presence of an EF-hand motif and
          other domain(s) using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. There are many
          databases for analyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> using different
          approaches to search for patterns, profiles and hidden
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Markov</ENAMEX> models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. InterProScan was chosen because it
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrates SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROSITE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRINTS, Pfam, ProDom</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMART</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIGRFAMs</ENAMEX> programs into a single comprehensive
          format. Therefore, scanning one site is the equivalent of
          scanning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> databases that use different approaches [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Inter-Pro Domain Table</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAtDB</ENAMEX> listed 219
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> as having EF-hands. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> did not
          have EF-hands identifiable by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> and so were
          eliminated from our analysis. We also did
          sequence-similarity searches using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have been characterized in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. The nucleotide and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAM4</ENAMEX>, a protein
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> EF-hands, were used to do BLAST searches
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TbIastN, BlastP</ENAMEX>) against the 
          Arabidopsis genome at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAtDB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
          We also used the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences of a Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CPK1</NUMEX>) and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with one
          EF-hand domain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">At2g46600</NUMEX>). Proteins showing similarity
          to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were checked for the presence of
          EF-hands using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> as above. Additional EF-hand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were found that had not been included in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAtDB Inter</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX> domain table. We also searched the
          literature for reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
          Arabidopsis that had been
          identified by various experimental approaches. Additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were identified from this search.
          Together, these searches resulted in identification of a
          possible total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tables</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the EF-hands were identified
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> prediction programs included in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which are indicated in bold
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, could be false positives. Further studies are
          needed to verify the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding ability of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> EF-hands. It is, however, worth noting that the
          activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in this category (AtPLC1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KCO1</ENAMEX>) has been shown to be dependent on Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>]. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are listed by their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ID</ENAMEX> number
          except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAM6</ENAMEX>, which has not been assigned an ID number.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX> and closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRKs</ENAMEX> (CPK-related protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX>) are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, as this is a large family
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that has been relatively well studied in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. 
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro</ENAMEX> domain table also lists the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for

          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> was given
          as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX>, with a note that the number may be an
          underestimate as a result of the stringent E-value cutoff
          used for the analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Figure 1ashows a comparison
          of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in sequenced
          eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and the percentage of the total
          number of genes represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding EF-hand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Our analysis revealed that there is possibly a
          very large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. 
          We used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TargetP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] to identify cellular targeting
          signals in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The results from
          this analysis show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are present in
          all major subcellular compartments (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>).

          but where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> did not
          identify any. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were shown to bind Ca

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. We did not include these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in

          study in rapeseed, using an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtClo1</TIMEX>, showed
          the presence of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> and lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>]. Clo3 was shown to be induced by abscisic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and to
          bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>].
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">InterPro documentation IPR000308</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proteins</ENAMEX> describes them as a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          that are primarily homo- or heterodimeric within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all</TIMEX>
          eukaryotic cells. They appear to effect intracellular
          signaling by regulating the catalytic activity of the
          bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, by regulating interactions between the
          bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, or by controlling the
          localization of the bound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-3</NUMEX>-3 protein
          GF14Ï‰ was shown to bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and the binding was
          localized to loop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GF14Ï‰</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> other
          proteins showing strong similarity to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GF14Ï</NUMEX>‰ have the
          exact sequence in the loop considered to be the EF-hand
          and so were included in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. Several other proteins
          showing similarity were divergent in this loop and so
          were not included.
          SUB1 was identified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involved in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptochrome</ENAMEX> and phytochrome signaling pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guo</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>] identified two
          EF-hand-like domains and demonstrated binding of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+by
          SUB1. SUL1 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are proteins showing similarity to SUB1
          but their sequences diverge somewhat in the EF-hand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Number of EF hands
          The number of EF-hands in each protein varied from one
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1bshows</NUMEX> the number and percentage of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> having a specific number of EF-hands. As stated
          above, most EF-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have pairs of EF-hands,
          which facilitate binding of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. There are a large
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with an odd number of EF-hand motifs
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 3</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX>). Several possibilities are suggested by this
          observation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with an odd number of EF-hand
          domains may function as homo- or heterodimers, they may
          bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+in a weaker manner, there may be another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'cryptic</ENAMEX>' Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding motif that is not identifiable,
          but is functional, or they may not bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+at all. Many
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing a single EF-hand motif were
          identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> prediction program and could be
          false positives.
          Examples of these possibilities can be seen in EF-hand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have been isolated and characterized
          previously. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">KCO1</NUMEX>) has one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiable EF</ENAMEX>-hand but another region within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> also shows similarity to an EF-hand. Although Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KCO1</ENAMEX> was not tested, the activity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> was shown to be Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. AtPLC1,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of phosphatidylinositol-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipase Cs</ENAMEX> (PLCs), has a putative EF-hand but Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+binding was not evaluated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. No other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AtPLC</ENAMEX> has an
          EF-hand domain but the amino-terminal sequences of
          several other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of a helices
          that may correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> EF-hand loop of AtPLC1 lies between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helices</ENAMEX>. The actin-binding activity of most fimbrins is
          inhibited by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>]. AtFIM2 was shown to be Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+independent, suggesting this single-EF-hand protein
          does not bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 51</TIMEX>]. The respiratory burst
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oxidase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in 
          Arabidopsis that have either one or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> EF-hands [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. An alignment (data not shown) of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, however, shows the presence of EF-hand
          like sequences for the missing EF-hand domain in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-EF-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Keller</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> EF-hand

          recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX>. The ability to bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was
          not addressed for single-EF-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins ABI1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GDH2</NUMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBL/SOS3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          shows the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 52</TIMEX>].
          Kudla 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], however, identified a
          sequence that represents a variation of the EF-hand
          domain that may be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> EF-hand. AtCP1 a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand domains</ENAMEX>, also has a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> EF-hand-like
          sequence at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but it is truncated
          and may not be functional [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
          The reported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand domains</ENAMEX> include
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen-associated proteins</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rboh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible
          EF-hands were identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> prediction program.

          significance of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand domains</ENAMEX> in various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> is not known, they may differ in their affinity

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, their InterProScan accession
          numbers and general type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or domain. As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> predicted to have other
          domains have putative EF-hand motifs identified by only
          one prediction program (shown in bold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Schematic diagrams of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> EF-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. As can be seen, the calmodulin-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have the EF-hands distributed throughout the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and no other domain is present. Other proteins
          have the EF-hands at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end</TIMEX> or the other, or in the
          middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with enzymatic or regulatory
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">domains</TIMEX> preceding or following the EF-hands.
          Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4either</ENAMEX> contain an
          EF-hand within the domain or are a specific type of
          EF-hand. These include EPS15 repeats, calflagin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recoverin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S100/IcaBP</ENAMEX>. EPS15 repeats are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction modules of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          that were first identified in tyrosine kinase substrates
          EPS15 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15R</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-domains</ENAMEX> in EPS15
          may include a Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding domain of the EF-hand type.
          Calflagins are flagellar Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> found in 
          Trypanosoma cruzi and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> brucei that have motifs similar
          to EF-hands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recoverin</ENAMEX> is a retinal Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding protein
          that belongs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain an 
          Arabidopsis retrotransposon
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATHILA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORF-1 protein domain</ENAMEX> and one has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">En/Spm</ENAMEX>-like
          transposon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domain. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, domains
          found in various enzymes are present in many of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Because of the presence of EF-hand
          motifs in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, regulation of these putative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> is likely to be Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent. The diversity of
          enzymes that contain EF-hand(s) indicates that a wide
          range of cellular processes is likely to be regulated by
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+. It is also of interest that some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a
          family have EF-hands and others do not, suggesting
          differential regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
          Several identified domains indicate that some EF-hand
          proteins interact with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (or themselves) or
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4lists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> that are
          involved in interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Cell
          processes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may be involved in are
          suggested by domains found in transcription or
          translation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> including elongation factors and the
          bHLH domain found in transcription factors. Domains such
          as potassium channels, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> allergen <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bra r II</ENAMEX>,
          mitochondrial carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the cation (Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and Na
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+</ENAMEX>) pore region and nucleoside transporters suggest
          possible functions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has a domain
          found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPH3 protein</ENAMEX>, a photoreceptor-interacting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is essential for phototropism. Another
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has a jacalin domain found in lectins.
          These domains in EF-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> should help in
          evaluating the function of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. For instance,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> identified as having a pollen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allergen Bra r</ENAMEX> II domain is similar to an EF-hand protein
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">APC1</NUMEX>) isolated by Rozwadowski 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. They showed APC1's
          affinity for Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and the potential for a Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          conformational change.
          Motifs such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP/GTP</ENAMEX>-binding region suggest that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing them interact with or bind to
          certain molecules. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTM</ENAMEX> is the site for attachment of

            None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in group I (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) has been
            reported in the literature. Some of them contain

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> includes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KCO1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtPLC1</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fimbrins
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) that have been reported in the literature
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> show similarity to KCO1

            of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cs</ENAMEX> have
            been isolated, but only one of them, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtPLC1</TIMEX>, has an
            EF-hand domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 42</TIMEX>]).
            AtPLC1, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> isolated as a dehydration and salt
            stress-induced gene, was able to hydrolyze
            phosphatidylinositol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>-bisphosphate and the activity
            was completely dependent on Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. AtFIM1 was
            identified as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
            however, Kovar 
            et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>] found that AtFIM1
            was Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-independent and so this may be a
            non-functional EF-hand as pointed out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurdy</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MatDB</ENAMEX> are similar

            stress (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SOS3</NUMEX>) and as a calcineurin B-like protein
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CBL1</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CBL/SOS3S</ENAMEX> have been identified [

            however, shown to interact with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]
            and a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interacting protein kinases</ENAMEX> has been
            identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54, 55, 56</TIMEX>]. Both Albrecht

            et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] have identified the
            domain in the kinases required for the interactions of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBL</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/SOS3</ENAMEX>.
            AtCP1, which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> EF-hands (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), is
            another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">NaCl</ENAMEX>-stress-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has been shown
            to bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean homolog</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AtCP1</ENAMEX> has been
            shown to be associated with the hypersensitive response
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. A subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> identified in this search
            show similarity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase</ENAMEX> 2A
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulatory B</ENAMEX> subunit. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these, At5g44090

            have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> EF-hand domain but contain no other

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Group IV</ENAMEX> contains the calmodulins (CAMs) and closely

            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene proteins</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMs</ENAMEX> are highly conserved
            small-molecular-weight acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX> amino

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 14</TIMEX>]. Binding of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> results in a
            conformational change which then allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX> to interact
            with target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to modulate their activity or
            function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 18, 62</ENAMEX>].

            number. BLAST searches with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CAM6</NUMEX> pick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAM7</TIMEX> as the

            identical, respectively, to 
            CAM7. CAM8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAM9</ENAMEX> are divergent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMs</ENAMEX>. They have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> rather than 148 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and
            vary considerably in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> EF-hand domain.
            Although they complemented a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast calmodulin</ENAMEX> (

            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. As can be seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, they do not fall
            into the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMs</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAM9</ENAMEX> being

            they are differentially expressed in different tissues
            and circumstances. For 
            CAM1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAM2</TIMEX>, and

            CAM3 could not be detected in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">floral</ENAMEX> stocks; 
            CAM1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CAM2</TIMEX>, and 
            CAM3 are inducible by touch

            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX>-inhibitory domain is involved in
            inhibiting the enzyme activity in the absence of Ca

            account for their substrate specificity and/or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRKs</ENAMEX> have similar domain
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Most of
            the CPKs contain fatty-acylation sites, including those
            for myristoylation and palmitoylation, which seem to be
            necessary for targeting to membranes and for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase

            kinase domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX>, but the autoinhibitory and CLDs
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRKs</ENAMEX> show weak sequence similarity to the
            corresponding domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX> have basal activities in the absence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+as
            a result of the presence of the autoinhibitory region.
            Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+binds the EF-hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLD</ENAMEX>, which results in

            presence of multiple isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX> in the 
            Arabidopsis genome implies that
            they may be involved in specific Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-signaling
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, may respond differentially to changes in

            unlike animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rboh</ENAMEX>, it has EF-hands that were shown to
            bind Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+[ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Both Leung

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> isolated the 
            ABI1 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. 
            ABI1 is similar to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serine/threonine phosphatase 2C</ENAMEX>, which in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is Mg

            ABI1 is induced by abscisic acid
            and was shown to regulate stomatal aperture in leaves
            and mitotic activity in root meristems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. A

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> in the EF-hand domain that does not conform
            to the EF-hand signature. A similar situation holds for
            glutamate dehydrogenases. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were isolated; one

            Studies by Furuichi 
            et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] indicate that TPC1
            is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-pore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that mediates Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx. It has

            that connects the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> transmembrane regions containing
            the pores [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+binding was not shown

        Conclusions
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s adaptively variable behavior or plasticity
        during its lifetime has been described as 'plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX>] and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and its sensors are key
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in this adaptive behavior. The large number of
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> indicates how [Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+]
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyt</ENAMEX> changes can profoundly affect a wide
        array of cellular processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Plants</ENAMEX> seem to have a large
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, some of which have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologs</ENAMEX> in non-plant systems whereas others are unique to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> also have unique sets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that interact with Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+sensors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>]. Signals
        from stresses such as pathogens, drought, cold and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> are
        mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EF</ENAMEX>-hand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 23, 3, 42, 57</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hormones</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">induce EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 78</TIMEX>] as do pathogen attacks [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 26</TIMEX>]. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potassium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, are involved in signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Others
        appear to be involved in developmental pathways. For
        example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX> domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in cell
        growth and differentiation, cell-cycle regulation and
        metabolic control [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. The wide variety of domains in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-hand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> also shows the diversity of the processes
        in which Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is involved. However, many of the EF-hand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> give little clue as to their function and may lead
        us in many other directions as their functions are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elucidated</ENAMEX>.
        The complexity of the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+messenger system is increased
        through the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. At the first
        level, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calmodulin</ENAMEX> adds complexity <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the number of
        isoforms present in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX>. The regulation of
        expression and the kinetics of interaction of these
        isoforms with different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can lend complexity to
        cell signaling. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> level of complexity is the number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> identified that interact with calmodulin. At
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> calmodulin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (CBPs) have been
        identified in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>]. Differential
        expression of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in cell types, developmental
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> and in response to signals adds more complexity to
        the pathways that can be regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAM</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX>, a very large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>, also
        add complexity to Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+regulation. Although the mechanism
        of regulation may be similar in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPK</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis CPKs</ENAMEX> may differ in their
        affinity for Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+in general and in the presence of their
        specific substrate in particular. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPK</ENAMEX>'s affinity for Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is many times higher in the presence of substrate than in
        its absence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. The involvement of only specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX> in
        stress responses has already been shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>].
        Identification of the substrates for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPK</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporal</ENAMEX> and spatial expression will be needed for
        elucidating the pathways of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+control in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, such as the phosphatases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rbohs</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CBL/SOS3S</ENAMEX>, also contribute to the complexity of Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+involvement in the regulation of many processes.
        Characterization of more Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will lead
        to further understanding of the roles of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-talk among various components of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-signaling and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.

          were obtained and analyzed for EF-hands and other domains
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Proteins not showing EF-hand
          domains were eliminated from the list. To identify
          proteins not listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">InterPro Domain Table</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAtDB</ENAMEX>, BLAST searches were done with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> was collected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> searches done
          for each protein sequence. Targeting information for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAtDB</ENAMEX> general report that
          includes the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TargetP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Phylogenetic analysis
          The full-length sequences of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> identified
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">InterProScan</ENAMEX> as containing an EF-hand (including those
          that are identified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> prediction program) were
          aligned using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEGALIGN</ENAMEX>. A heuristic method using PAUP
          4.08a generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. A majority-rules consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tree</ENAMEX> was computed from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPKs</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRKs</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> alignment was done using the CAM-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. A bootstrap method of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PAUP.4.06</NUMEX>a with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          bootstraps was used to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>.
