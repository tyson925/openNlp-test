        In a recent investigation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sourial et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] found
        that a high proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">agitation</ENAMEX> and other behavioral problems in acute care
        hospital settings, and that these behaviors are associated
        with significant burden on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. The literature suggests
        that older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, in general, admitted to acute care
        units may be at increased risk for behavioral problems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . In a multisite investigation of acute care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnick et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] found that older patients
        were more likely to be physically restrained than younger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Additionally, they found that the dominant
        rationale for the use of restraints in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> disrupting their own treatment, rather than
        prevention of falls.
        Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, in addition to
        being ill, fatigued, or in considerable physical or mental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distress</ENAMEX>, are suddenly faced with stimuli levels far above
        those in their home settings. Their environment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>,
        caregivers, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> routines are all drastically altered
        from what they know. With such stressors and changes in
        environment, behavioral problems and/or cognitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impairment</ENAMEX> may occur [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX> staff and family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may be faced with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who was cooperative and
        attentive at home but is now increasingly combative [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . Combative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may require chemical or physical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX> and in-hospital psychiatric consultation.
        While several studies have focused upon the onset of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX> and functional decline in hospitalized older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, there are few investigations of behavioral problems
        in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Typically such behaviors are discussed
        within the context of restraint use, but behavioral
        problems are not limited to combative behaviors, which
        necessitate restraint. Sleep disturbance, anxiety, and
        irritability are among a broad range of behaviors that can
        negatively impact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Given the bourgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, the
        number of hospitalized elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> will continue to
        increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming decades</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Health</ENAMEX>
        Interview Survey reports that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years of age</TIMEX> were
        discharged from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, and accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX>
        percent of all discharges [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Agitation or other
        behavioral problems in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> could have
        significant negative consequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Indeed, in our recent investigation of clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> on
        acute care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> self reported that such behavioral
        problems were often encountered and of significant burden [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . Yet, to date, little is known about the prevalence
        of agitation and behavioral problems in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        acute care settings. The objectives of this study were to
        (a) determine the quantity and quality of behavioral
        problems in older hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on acute care
        units, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two days</TIMEX> of hospitalization; (b)
        determine the impact of these problem behaviors on nursing
        staff; and (c) investigate whether there are predictor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, which could be easily assessed by clinicians at
        admission, that may place older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> at increased risk of
        developing behavioral problems in this setting.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Veteran</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Affairs hospitals</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> participated in this study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were
          admitted to either medical or surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> depending on
          their diagnosis and the care they required. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> had
          a broad range of diagnoses from orthopedic problems to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>. Overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the current study
          were admitted to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at each site. These
          were standard acute care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 to 26</NUMEX>
          beds per unit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty years of age</TIMEX>, admitted
          to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were approached for participation in this
          study. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had a caregiver(s), the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX>(s) were also asked to participate in the study.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and caregivers provided informed consent
          before participating. All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were male. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ranged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61 to 85 years</TIMEX>, with a mean
          age of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and had an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.3</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of education. With respect to ethnicity,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Pacific</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was unreported.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> lived alone, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a past
          history of psychiatric disorder. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a
          history of alcohol abuse, as indicated by self-report and
          chart review. At baseline, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24.8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX>) and a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX>). There
          were no significant differences between the two sites
          with respect to basic demographics or values on the MMSE
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX> at admission.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> approached refused to participate.
          Although this represents too small a number to conduct
          quantitative analyses, they had similar age-range, gender
          and range of illnesses as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. However, since
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> did not participate in the study we
          were unable to compare them in terms of pain, level of
          depressive symptoms or cognitive status.
        
        
          Measures
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPI</ENAMEX>-Q)
            This questionnaire was developed and cross-validated
            with the standard NPI to provide a brief assessment of
            neuropsychiatric symptomotology and behavioral problems
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The NPI-Q is used to measure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> categories of
            behavioral disturbance, in particular: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delusions</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
            Hallucinations, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anxiety</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Depression/Dysphoria</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agitation/Aggression</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elation/Euphoria</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)
            Disinhibition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) Irritability/Lability, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Apathy/Indifference, 10</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Motor Disturbance</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nighttime Behavior Problems</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) Problems with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appetite/Eating</ENAMEX>. The NPI-Q is completed by a caregiver
            (in this case a clinical staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>) and asks whether
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> exhibits each of the above behaviors. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX> then ranks the severity of the behavior
            exhibited on a scale of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 3</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> being the most
            severe. The NPI-Q yields a total severity score, for
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, which is the sum of the severity scores
            obtained for each behavioral category. Additionally,
            the caregiver ranks their level of distress from each
            behavior, on a scale of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 5</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> indicating the
            most severe level of distress. The NPI-Q yields a total
            distress score, which is the sum of the distress scores
            obtained for each behavioral category. The NPI-Q takes
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 10 minutes</TIMEX> to administer. In the current
            study the caregiver was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the nursing staff
            caring for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two days</TIMEX> of
            hospitalization.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mini-Mental State Examination</ENAMEX> (MMSE)
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> is a brief mental status examination
            designed to quantify cognitive status by assessing
            performance on the following cognitive domains:
            orientation; language; calculation; memory; and
            visuospatial reproduction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . A score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> or
            less (maximum = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>) is generally considered evidence of
            cognitive impairment. This measure takes approximately
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> to administer.
          
          
            Geriatric <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Depression</ENAMEX> Scale (GDS)
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-item <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX> is a widely used depression
            screening device specifically designed for the elderly
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . A yes/no format was purposely chosen for ease
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX> has high internal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consistency</ENAMEX> and high test-retest reliability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX> can be completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 10 to 15</TIMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. A score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> or higher is indicative of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Procedures
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty years of age</TIMEX> were contacted upon
            admission on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> involved in the study. In order
            to assess for agitation and/or behavioral problems, we
            employed the NPI-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q.</ENAMEX> Several studies have suggested that
            patient charts do not always adequately report the
            occurrence of behavioral problems in acute care
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX>, and only the most severe problems are likely
            to be documented [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . We felt that the NPI-Q
            would provide a more objective and reliable assessment
            of the extent of behavioral problems in this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In addition to providing an assessment of
            behavioral problems, the NPI-Q also provides an
            assessment of the direct care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX>' level of distress
            specific to each behavior.
            In the current study, the NPI-Q was administered
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-days post-admission to a clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> member
            caring for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. We chose to administer the
            NPI-Q <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> post-admission because a significant
            number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are most likely to be
            discharged or transferred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> post-admission.
            Additionally, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-days post admission we were able
            to identify staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who had similar levels of
            exposure to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the study.
            In order to assess whether there are patient
            variables which might predict the subsequent occurrence
            of behavioral problems during hospitalization, we aimed
            to include variables for which information is either
            routinely acquired at regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> visits or which
            could be easily assessed by clinicians at admission. We
            obtained information at admission on the following
            variables: age, ethnicity, level of education, and
            living arrangement. We assessed history of substance
            abuse and psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, by both obtaining
            information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> themselves and by
            reviewing patient charts. We also included brief
            measures of mental status and mood because prior
            research has suggested an association between these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> and the occurrence of behavioral problems in
            older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in long-term care and other settings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . Thus, at admission, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were also
            administered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX>.
          
        
      
      
        Results
        First, we determined the quantity and quality of
        behavioral problems in older hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on acute
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two days</TIMEX> of hospitalization.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>) had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        behavioral problem as indicated by ratings on the NPI-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q.</ENAMEX>
        Overall, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibited a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
        behavioral problems. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1presents</NUMEX> the number of
        behaviors exhibited in each of the different behavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> assessed by the NPI-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q. Anxiety</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>,
        irritability, and agitation/aggression were among the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commonly</ENAMEX> observed behaviors, respectively. Table 1presents
        the behavioral problems exhibited by each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>) exhibited one problem
        behavior; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>) exhibited 2
        behavioral problems and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>) exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or more behavioral problems. The
        mean severity rating on the NPI-Q for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        exhibiting behavioral problems, was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.9 ± 4.0</NUMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-18</ENAMEX>);
        mean distress = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.8 ± 2.9</NUMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-30</ENAMEX>). However, this
        reflects the fact that the NPI-Q severity and distress
        scores are cumulative over all behavioral categories for
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The mean level of severity for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
        behavioral problems is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.70 ± .78</NUMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX>); and the mean
        level of distress for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> behavioral problems is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.34</NUMEX> ±
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.75</NUMEX> (range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-5</ENAMEX>). This suggests that the behavioral
        problems exhibited were of moderate severity, resulting in
        mild to moderate distress to staff.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we determined the impact of these problem
        behaviors on staff burden. Level of severity of a
        behavioral problem was highly correlated with the distress
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rho</ENAMEX> =<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.70</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. lists the mean
        severity and mean level of distress to staff for each
        behavioral category.
        Thirdly, we investigated whether there are predictor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, which could be easily assessed by clinicians at
        admission, which may place older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> at increased risk
        of developing behavioral problems in this setting. To do
        this we conducted a regression analysis. Due to the limited
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a history of substance abuse, we
        excluded substance abuse from the analysis. Thus, we
        conducted a multiple regression analysis that included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        predictor variables: age, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of education, living
        arrangement, ethnicity, psychiatric history, and
        performance at admission on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX>. Our
        analysis revealed that a statistically significant
        proportion of the variance of the NPI-Q was accounted for
        by baseline MMSE performance, with lower scores on the MMSE
        (more cognitive impairment) being significantly associated
        with higher ratings on the NPI-Q (more behavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disturbance</ENAMEX>). No other significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were
        observed.
        We also conducted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receiver Operating Characteristic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curve Analysis</ENAMEX> (ROC). The ROC procedure examines every
        predictor variable and their associated cutpoints and
        identifies the variables with the optimal balance between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity for identifying those
        particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the specific outcome of interest
        (namely, presence of behavioral problems). The result is a
        decision tree (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For further details regarding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraemer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis is
        typically conducted on large sample sizes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> can be
        conducted on smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in order to assess the first
        variable which discriminates among the sample and at which
        cut-point such discrimination occurs. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> and cut-point isolated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis was
        performance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.37</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .05</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cutpoint</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>). Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> of less than or
        equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>) exhibited a behavioral
        problem during hospitalization as rated by the NPI-Q (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an MMSE greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX>) exhibited a behavioral problem during
        hospitalization.
        It should be noted that this cut-point of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> on the MMSE
        is considerably above the cut-point of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> that is commonly
        used to identify dementia. However, it is interesting to
        note that in this sample, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX>) of the patients
        had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 or less</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 24 and 26</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        In the current study we found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>) exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> behavioral problem in their
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of hospitalization. All together, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibited a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> problem behaviors in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of hospitalization. In particular, anxiety,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, irritability, and agitation/aggression were the
        most commonly observed behaviors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallucinations</ENAMEX> and
        delusions were associated with the highest level of
        severity and highest level of distress; however, they
        occurred rarely. Of the more frequently occurring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">behaviors</ENAMEX>, nighttime problems was the behavioral category
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the highest mean level of severity.
        However, agitation resulted in the highest level of
        distress to staff. The results find that, on average, the
        observed behavioral problems are of moderate severity and
        result on average, in mild distress to staff. While the
        occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> behavioral problem, in and of itself, may
        not be a significant burden, the cumulative impact of so
        many problem behaviors over so short a time span may be
        very disruptive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and we have previously reported
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> report a large number of behavioral problems in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        The results of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also suggest that the mental
        status of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> at admission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> is
        predictive of behavioral problems during their
        hospitalization. Thus, assessment of the mental status of
        older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> at admission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> may represent an
        effective way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and clinicians to identify older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are more likely to develop behavioral problems
        during hospitalization and who could potentially be
        targeted for procedures that might reduce the occurrence of
        such problems. This finding is in line with the literature,
        which suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who have cognitive deficits
        are at greater risk for exhibiting behavioral problems in
        long-term and other non-acute settings [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> have found lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> at admission
        predictive of functional decline following acute medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and hospitalization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Additionally,
        cognitive impairment is associated with the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delirium</ENAMEX> during hospitalization, which in turn, can result
        in a variety of behavioral problems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . However, in
        these studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> usually had cognitive impairment
        indicative of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>, whereas the current study suggests
        that among hospitalized elderly, a MMSE score of less than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">27</ENAMEX> places a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at increased risk of behavioral
        problems. It may be that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with even the mildest
        degree of cognitive impairment is more vulnerable to any
        negative impact of hospitalization on behavior.
        Alternatively, this may simply reflect the fact that in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> analysis we utilized a broad criterion for specifying
        the occurrence of a behavioral problem, with a rating of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or higher on the NPI-Q considered indicative of the
        presence of a behavioral problem. However, as mentioned,
        the occurrence of even one behavioral problem can be
        disruptive. Additionally, as our multivariate analysis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reveals</ENAMEX>, increased ratings on the NPI-Q were associated
        with lower scores on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX>, such that more cognitively
        impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibited a greater quantity and/or
        severity of behavioral problems.
        This relationship between mental status and behavioral
        problems is all the more important given the observation in
        the current study of a large percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 or less</NUMEX> at admission, suggesting that a greater
        proportion of older hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> may be suffering
        from cognitive impairment than has been traditionally
        recognized. Prior studies suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> admitted to general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> have
        dementia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . However, in the current investigation,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMSE</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 or less</NUMEX> which is indicative of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dementia</ENAMEX>, although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a
        documented diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the few studies
        that investigated cognitive impairment in an acute care
        setting observed a similar prevalence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hickey et al.</ENAMEX>, in an
        investigation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the acute care
        setting, average age of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">74.7</NUMEX>, found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> had an MMSE of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> or less [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Overall, this suggests that a
        significant proportion of older hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are
        cognitively impaired, and thus greater proportions of
        hospitalized older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> may be at increased risk for
        behavioral problems.
        However, the current study had several limitations,
        which impact the interpretations that can be made and which
        future studies might address. In addition to the small
        sample size, the data in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are limited to only the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of hospitalization, and this significantly
        impacts the prevalence of behavioral problems in the
        current study. It may be that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are more likely to
        exhibit behavioral problems at this time, but it also is
        likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not exhibit behavioral
        problems in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two days</TIMEX> may do so later in the
        course of their hospitalization. Therefore, it is not clear
        whether we would observe the same relationship between our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predictors</ENAMEX> and the occurrence of behavioral problems if we
        included all episodes of behavioral problems exhibited
        during the full course of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s hospitalization.
        Ideally, future investigations of this issue would assess
        for the presence of behavioral problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> during
        hospitalization.
        As the current study was conducted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans' Affairs</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, the male-only sample further limits the
        interpretation of the results to the male gender. Some
        studies have suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are at increased risk for
        exhibiting behavioral problems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , and this may have
        significantly biased the prevalence of behavioral problems
        in our investigation.
        Additionally, we included a limited number of predictors
        in the current study. Although we identified predictors
        that could be easily obtained or assessed at admission,
        other variables, including diagnosis, acuity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-morbidities</ENAMEX>, pain, and type and dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, may
        also be associated with the development of behavioral
        problems in this setting. However, we did not have a
        sufficiently large sample size to investigate these
        variables given their significant heterogeneity across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> in this study. Future studies of larger
        numbers of hospitalized elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> could investigate a
        broader range of predictor variables. Also, several of our
        predictor variables were based upon self-report, and such
        self-report may be influenced by cognitive status. Indeed,
        even depressive symptoms, as assessed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX>, may be
        under-reported by those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with cognitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impairment</ENAMEX>, although we observed no association between
        mental status and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDS</ENAMEX>.
        Since clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> can have limited shifts and care
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at a time they may under-report
        certain behavioral changes, particularly apathy and
        depressive symptoms. Alternatively, distress responses to
        behavioral problems may vary among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and may be
        influenced by such factors as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> experience, or whether
        or not the clinical staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> has a background in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">psychiatry</ENAMEX> or geriatrics. The current study did not
        investigate these issues, but future studies are needed to
        explore other factors impacting staff distress responses to
        behavioral problems.
        Overall, however, the current study suggests that a
        significant proportion of older hospitalized patients
        exhibit behavioral problems, and these problems are
        distressful to staff. Additionally, our findings indicate
        that a large percentage of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are cognitively
        impaired and that lower mental status in these patients
        places them at increased risk for developing behavioral
        problems during hospitalization.
