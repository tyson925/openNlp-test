        The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential for
        degradation of many regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> are
        targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation by attachment
        of a polyubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. The addition of a polyubiquitin
        chain to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> requires the sequential action of a
        ubiquitin-activating enzyme (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E1</NUMEX>), a ubiquitin-conjugating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E2</NUMEX>) and a ubiquitin-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E3</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . E3
        activities are thought to be essential because they are
        involved in substrate recognition. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are E3s
        composed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullin</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> Cul1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cdc53</NUMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> ), as well as, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Skp1</TIMEX>,
        Roc1 (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rbx1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hrt1</NUMEX>) and one of the numerous
        F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that act as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for the substrate
        (for review see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ).
        The founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc4</ENAMEX>, was
        identified through genetic analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> transition
        in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and served as a model for the study of
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Mutations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E2</TIMEX> enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc34</ENAMEX> or in
        any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc4components</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdc53/Cul1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Skp1 and Cdc4</TIMEX>)
        arrest cells at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> transition because of a failure to
        degrade the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sic1</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In a wild-type situation, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">G1 cyclin/CDK</ENAMEX>
        complexes phosphorylate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sic1</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of G1</TIMEX>. This leads
        to Cdc34-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sic1</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sic1</ENAMEX>, but not the unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, is
        recruited to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> by binding to the WD domain of
        Cdc4 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box motif of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skp1</ENAMEX> so
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box protein acts as a bridge between substrate
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Cdc53 forms the core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">binding Skp1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Roc1 and Cdc34</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdc53/Roc1 subcomplex</ENAMEX>
        stimulates the ubiquitination activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc34</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ]
        . Upon association with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sic1</ENAMEX> is extensively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitinated</ENAMEX> and then degraded by the proteasome. While
        mutations in the 
        CDC53 gene of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae eliminate SCF activity
        toward its many diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, the phenotype is
        nonetheless specific. Presumably, arrest at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX>
        transition is a result of the thresholds and kinetics of
        action of the various substrates, which imparts special
        importance to the targeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sic1</ENAMEX> for degradation.
        Mutations in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans ortholog 
        Cul1 lead to increased cell number [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] showing that in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> a different aspect of
        cell cycle regulation is controlled in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX> dependent
        fashion. It has been inferred that a deficit in Cul1
        function results in defects in turn-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX> of specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and that the phenotype varies between systems
        because of differences in the spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> affected
        and differences in the importance of the targeted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        The transcription factor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> is an important regulator
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> phase transition in metazoans and a major
        target of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The
        mechanisms controlling E2F activity have not been
        completely elucidated. E2F is activated toward the end of
        G1 and it functions to promote S phase. Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivated</ENAMEX> and/or downregulated upon progression to S
        phase, a regulatory feature that appears critical as E2F
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX> or ectopic activation induces apoptosis both
        in mammalian cells and in flies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
        . Inactivation of the DNA-binding activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F-1</ENAMEX> by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cyclin A</ENAMEX>/Cdk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has been shown to be critical for
        proper S phase progression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . In mammalian cells,
        E2F-1 is also subject to proteasome-mediated degradation [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and recent evidence indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX>-1
        degradation occurs in S phase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX>-1
        stability has also been linked to its association with the
        F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Skp2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] but this has not been tied to a
        specific phase of the cell cycle. In addition, Skp2
        knock-out cells do not accumulate E2F [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and an E2F
        mutant unable to bind Skp2 is still ubiquitinated and
        unstable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the basis of S phase destruction of
        E2F-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> remains unresolved. Analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> levels in the 
        Drosophila eye disc showed a
        disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> in the S phase cells of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphogenetic furrow</ENAMEX>, suggesting conservation of the S
        phase destruction of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulator</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        To explore potential roles for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX> in cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , we overexpressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> Cul1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mCul1</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal disc and found that
        this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading
        to a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function. A screen for modifiers of
        the resulting small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> phenotype identified E2F as a
        putative target of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> action. Further analysis of genetic
        interactions implicated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Slimbcomplex</ENAMEX> as a regulator
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> function.

          reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function
          Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding highly conserved activites often
          function across species boundaries, we attempted to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">evaluate mouse</ENAMEX> Cul1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mCul1</NUMEX>) function in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . To this end, we used a
          GAL4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> to drive overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mCul1</ENAMEX> in the
          wing disc. 
          MS1096 is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">X-linked</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
          that expresses GAL4 strongly on the dorsal surface and
          more weakly on the ventral surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> primordium
          in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> instar larval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal discs. Because of
          dosage compensation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GAL4</TIMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> ( 
          MS1096<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Y</ENAMEX> ) are twice those in
          heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MS1096/+</ENAMEX> ). In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> ( 
          MS1096<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Y</ENAMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UAS-mCul1/+</ENAMEX> ), mCul1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX> led to a strong reduction in the size of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> without any gross patterning defects (fig.
          1A,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Females</ENAMEX> ( 
          MS1096<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/+;UAS-mCul1/+</ENAMEX> ) displayed a
          weaker phenotype that was sometimes indistinguishable
          from wild-type (see fig. 2A). In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, further
          increasing expression by using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UAS-mCul1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> reduces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> to a rudimentary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stump</ENAMEX> (not shown). The reduced wings also occasionally
          showed a multiple wing hair phenotype in which several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trichomes</ENAMEX> instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> were produced by individual
          intervein cells, particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> near the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> cross-vein. Introduction of a single mutant copy
          of the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Df</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2R</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NCX8</TIMEX> ) dominantly enhanced
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> reduction (fig. 1C). In contrast, decreasing the
          level of endogenous 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cul3 /</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guftagu</ENAMEX> (another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullin</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://flybase.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">indiana</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/</ENAMEX>) or
          expressing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">GFP marker</ENAMEX> had no effect. Coexpression of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cul1</ENAMEX> ( 
          dCul1 ) suppressed the phenotype
          induced by expression of 
          mCul1 (fig. 1D). These data show
          that overexpression of mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cul1</ENAMEX> has a dominant negative
          effect on 
          Cul1 function, or that 
          dCul1 suppresses a neomorphic
          activity of 
          mCul1 .
          To test if overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mCul1</ENAMEX> is sensitive to the
          dosage of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> components, we asked whether changing
          the copy number of both 
          dRoc1 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dSkpA</ENAMEX> can modify the 
          mCul1 -induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>. 
          dRoc1 and 
          dSkpA are located at the tip of the
          X chromosome in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> 1B (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flybase</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://flybase.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">indiana</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/</ENAMEX>). The small wing
          phenotype seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies overexpressing</ENAMEX> mCul1 was enhanced
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> also had a deficiency uncovering this region
          (fig. 2A,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>), while coexpression of dSkpA rescued the
          wing phenotypes (fig. 2C,2<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). These results show that SCF
          function limits the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mCul1</NUMEX> overexpression phenotype.
          Cul1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function are required for
          proteasome-dependent degradation of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. We thus tested whether reduction in
          proteasome function would modify the phenotype caused by
          mCul1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX>. The 
          DTS5 and 
          DTS7 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> are mutations in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β6 and β2</NUMEX> subunits of the proteasome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, which have antimorphic activity, acted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dominantly</ENAMEX> to strongly enhance the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> phenotype
          generated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCul1</TIMEX> overexpression (fig. 2E) supporting
          the idea that the phenotype is due to reduced degradation
          of an SCF substrate.
          To directly assess Cul1 function, we sought a target
          protein whose destruction might be limited by the
          activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cul1/proteasome pathway.</ENAMEX> While SCF
          triggers ubiquitination and proteasome action degrades
          many substrates to completion, a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> are instead
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleaved</ENAMEX> and partially degraded. This is true of the
          transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor Cubitus interruptus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ci</ENAMEX>): it is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleaved</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal portion is degraded [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleavage</ENAMEX> and degradation require
          phosphorylation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Slmb</ENAMEX>, and proteasomal activity.
          While complete inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Slmbcauses</ENAMEX> cell death,
          it was shown that a cell-viable hypomorphic 
          slimb <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> resulted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of unprocessed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ci</ENAMEX>. Based on this, and
          findings that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ci</ENAMEX> accumulation is especially sensitive to
          pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome (data not
          shown), it appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ci</ENAMEX> levels are particularly
          sensitive to partial reduction in the activity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX>/proteasome pathway of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> processing/degradation.
          Inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ci</ENAMEX> processing can be scored by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal epitope [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . This assay
          showed that reduction in the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Roc1</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> activities that contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function, is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ci</ENAMEX> staining [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
          . Similarly, reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cul1</NUMEX> function by mutation in
          Cul1 (data not shown and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ) or by overexpressing
          mCul1 (fig. 2Fand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">2G</ENAMEX>) led to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ci</ENAMEX> accumulation.
          Together these results indicate that mCul1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overexpression</ENAMEX> leads to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cul1</NUMEX> dominant negative action
          that reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function. Based on the strength of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> and its enhancement by removal of an endogenous
          copy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX>, we infer that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mCul1</NUMEX> expression only
          partially suppresses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cul1</NUMEX> function to create a
          hypomorphic phenotype. We infer that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> defect
          results from a reduction in the rate of degradation of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> action.
        
        
          Reduction in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cul1</NUMEX> function induces apoptosis
          The reduction in wing size in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCul1</TIMEX> overexpressing
          flies could result from changes in cell size or cell
          number. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> blade produces a hair and
          hair density indicates cell density and hence cell size.
          Wing hair density was unchanged by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCul1</TIMEX> expression, even
          when there was a dramatic effect on wing size (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62.6</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cells/7950 μm</ENAMEX> 2for 
          MS1096<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Y</ENAMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60.8</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> cells<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/7950</NUMEX> μm
          2for 
          MS1096<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/Y</ENAMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UAS-mCul1/+</ENAMEX> ). This result
          suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mCul1</ENAMEX> overexpression causes a reduction in
          cell number either by a coordinate reduction in cell
          growth and proliferation or by increasing cell death. To
          distinguish between these possibilities, we dissected
          wing imaginal discs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late third instar</TIMEX> larvae and
          stained them for mitotic or apoptotic cells. Labelling
          with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-phospho</ENAMEX>-histone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> did not reveal
          any significant changes in the number of mitotic cells
          (not shown). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">acridine</ENAMEX> orange staining showed a
          large increase in cell death throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> pouch
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mCul1</ENAMEX> was overexpressed (fig. 3A,3<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). Coexpression
          of baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein p35</ENAMEX> rescued the
          reduction in wing size (fig. 3C,3<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) indicating that mCul1
          overexpression induces elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. mCul1-induced
          apoptosis was insensitive to the coexpression of dominant
          negative forms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> (not shown). p35 expression also
          suppressed the multiple wing hair phenotype indicating
          that this phenotype too requires apoptosis. As dead cells
          do not contribute to adult structures, this phenotype
          must be a secondary consequence of cell death. We
          conclude that limiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function induces apoptosis.
          Note that this conclusion does not argue against a cell
          cycle role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX>, as defects in cell cycle progression
          can trigger apoptosis.
        
        
          Dominant negative mCul1 genetically interacts with
          E2F
          Having determined that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mCul1</NUMEX> overexpression
          phenotype results from a dominant negative effect, we
          were in a position to test for genetic interactions
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between mCul1</TIMEX> overexpression and mutations in potential
          cell cycle targets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> have
          been implicated in cell cycle control in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>,
          we tested whether changing the dosage of cell cycle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> dominantly modified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mCul1</TIMEX> overexpression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Reductions in the levels of a variety of cell
          cycle genes - 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin E</ENAMEX> , 
          dacapo , 
          roughex , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBF</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">string</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cyclin A</ENAMEX> , 
          rca1 , 
          wee1 and 
          cdc2 - had no effect on wing size
          (not shown). In contrast, reducing the level of 
          E2F by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> completely restored
          wild-type wing size (fig. 4A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,4C</ENAMEX>), an effect that
          correlated with a strong reduction in cell death in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disc</ENAMEX> (fig. 4E<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). The presence of a single 
          hs-E2F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> gave a weak and
          incompletely penetrant enhancement in the absence of heat
          shock, and this enhancement was stronger and completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penetrant</ENAMEX> when the transgenic strain was exposed to a
          heat shock treatment every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> during <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> instar and
          early pupal development (fig. 4D). Since the presence of
          the 
          hs-E2F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and its induction
          by our heat shock protocol (low level overexpression
          compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asano et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) had no phenotype when in
          a wild-type background, we conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mCul1</ENAMEX> expression
          sensitizes the cells to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> overexpression. The
          reciprocal suppression by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> mutation and enhancement by
          E2F <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> show that the apoptosis triggered by
          mCul1 is mediated by or requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> function. Because a
          high level of ectopic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> is known to
          induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , these results suggest
          that mCul1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> might interfere with normal E2F
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Dominant negative Cul1 expression disrupts E2F
          inactivation in S phase
          Immunostaining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> in the furrow of the eye disc
          showed an abrupt drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels at the position
          where most cells exit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G1</ENAMEX> and initiate S phase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
          Using a double label approach, we were able to test
          directly for overlap between <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> presence and S phase as
          marked by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-bromodeoxyuridine</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX>) incorporation in
          dividing cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> disc despite the asynchrony of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>. No <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> staining was detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX> labelled
          cells (green) of wild-type wing discs, whereas non-S
          phase cells showed strong E2F (red) staining (fig. 5A,
          5B, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5C</TIMEX>) (no E2F <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a thousand</NUMEX>
          BrdU positive cells from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> different discs). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulated</ENAMEX> in advance of significant BrdU
          incorporation in wild-type wing disc cells.
          When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mCul1</ENAMEX> is overexpressed, a small fraction of S
          phase cells (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> BrdU positive cells from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> discs) contains detectable amounts of
          E2F (fig. 5D, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5E</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5F</TIMEX>, arrowheads). Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> is normally
          degraded prior to S phase, the overlap in staining
          suggests that the partial suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cul1</ENAMEX> caused by
          mCul1 expression slowed E2F destruction to the point that
          it persisted briefly in S phase. We suggest, but have not
          demonstrated, that the low percentage of cells showing
          the overlap in the staining is due to a remaining
          capacity of the residual SCF activity to promote slower
          but still effective elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> during S phase. In
          any case, our finding shows that when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dCul1</NUMEX> function is
          reduced, the normal pattern of E2F degradation in S phase
          is disrupted, leading to inappropriate persistence of
          E2F. While it could also be suggested that this effect
          might be secondary to other disruptions induced by
          dominant negative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX>, the genetic suppression of
          phenotypes by reduction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> dose (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX>) suggests
          otherwise, as do the analyses of the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slimb</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">below</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> is required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> downregulation in S
          phase
          The experiments described above demonstrate that
          overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mCul1</ENAMEX> produces a phenotype that can be
          modified by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> site mutations and therefore could be
          used for a more general genome-wide modifier-screen. To
          determine whether other suppressors or enhancers might be
          isolated, we tested if deficiencies on the third
          chromosome uncover other potential interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> modifying <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Df</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3R</NUMEX>)e-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">R1</NUMEX> , removes region
          93B6;<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D3-4</ENAMEX> and acts as an enhancer of the small wing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in this region, 
          slimb , is an interesting candidate
          because this gene encodes an F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is part
          of an SCF complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Several independent
          alleles of 
          slimb were tested and all enhanced
          the dominant-negative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCul1</TIMEX> overexpression phenotype
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, compare A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> deficiencies uncovering
          other predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CG4911, CG3428,</ENAMEX>
          CG2010 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CG9003</ENAMEX>) or mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box protein
          genes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ppa</ENAMEX> and 
          ago [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] had no effect on
          the phenotype (not shown) showing that the effect is
          specific. Interestingly, co-reduction of 
          E2F and 
          slimb function reversed the 
          slimb enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mCul1 overexpression</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> (fig. 6Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">6C</ENAMEX>) and loss of a copy of 
          slimb attenuated the suppression of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mCul1</NUMEX> phenotype resulting from loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of 
          E2F (compare fig. 4Cand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">6C</ENAMEX>). This
          mutual co-suppression suggests that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slimb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> exert opposing
          activities on the same process and perhaps that Slimb
          acts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> or on a critical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of E2F
          activity.
          We thus wished to test whether loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> had an
          effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F protein</ENAMEX> in imaginal discs. As 
          slimb null mutants die as first
          instar larvae, direct analysis of the mutant discs was
          not possible. The severity of the slimb mutant phenotype
          suggested that the mutation reduced crucial SCF functions
          much more than did expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCul1</TIMEX>. We used a 
          slimb mutant stock carrying a 
          slimb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> under the control
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSP</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> to modify the time of onset of the
          
          slimb mutant phenotype. In the
          absence of heat shock, 
          slimb homozygotes exhibited the
          early lethality of 
          slimb mutants, but a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX> heat shock at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">37°C</ENAMEX> during <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instar was enough
          to allow some larvae to reach the wandering <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> instar
          stage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days later</TIMEX>. These larvae have small imaginal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discs</ENAMEX>. Labelling of these discs with the anti-E2F
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibody</ENAMEX> revealed that nearly all cells expressed E2F
          (fig. 7A). Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> also incorporated low
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> (fig. 7Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7C</ENAMEX>), usually in regions of the
          nucleus with lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> also had
          high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> incorporation and these also
          expressed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX>, although at lower levels (asterisks on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. 7Aand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7B</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">An hour and a half</TIMEX> after a heat shock
          that restored <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> expression, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BrdU</ENAMEX>-labelled cells no
          longer contained detectable levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> (fig.
          7D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,7</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,7F</ENAMEX>). No accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> can be seen in 
          slimb mutant discs (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>)
          suggesting that any effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> occurs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posttranscriptionnally</ENAMEX>. These results indicate that
          elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> replication requires
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> interact in vitro
          The above results raise the possibility that an SCF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slmbcomplex</ENAMEX> can target E2F for degradation. If this is
          the case, it is expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> would recruit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> to
          the complex. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> physically interact. To this end,
          35S-labelled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> was produced in vitro in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> germ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysate</ENAMEX> and incubated with the WD repeat region of Slimb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> and bound to beads. Analysis of bead
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) showed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiolabeled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> with the fusion containing the WD-repeat
          region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) but not with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> depends on a
          phosphorylation event as it is prevented by the presence
          of active alkaline phosphatase (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) but not when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX> is inhibited by sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vanadate</ENAMEX> (lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          Similar results were obtained with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F2</TIMEX>, the other 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family member</ENAMEX> (not
          shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have provided evidence indicating a role for an SCF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slmbcomplex</ENAMEX> in elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> during S phase in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . We first demonstrated
        that mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cul1 overexpression</ENAMEX> has a dominant negative
        effect on SCF function in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal disc resulting
        in apoptotic cell death leading to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> phenotype
        in adult flies. Thus, SCF activity normally suppresses cell
        death. The cell death that occurred upon reduction of Cul1
        function was suppressed when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> function was reduced by
        mutation. This genetic interaction might be due to action
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F and Cul1</TIMEX> in parallel pathways, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> suppressing and
        one enhancing cell death, or they might act in opposite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX> in the same pathway. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are
        involved in controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein degradation</ENAMEX>, we favoured
        the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cul1</ENAMEX> promotes the destruction of E2F
        and that the inappropriate persistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> leads to cell
        death. Consistent with this idea, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> overproduction can
        induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, cell cycle
        specific destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> was suggested by the finding
        that E2F <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> becomes undetectable in the synchronised S
        phase cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphogenetic furrow</ENAMEX> of the eye imaginal
        disc [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Our double labelling analysis extended this
        finding to the asynchronously cycling cells of the wing
        imaginal disc and demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> is rapidly degraded
        prior to significant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>. In contrast, we found
        that E2F was detected in a fraction of S phase cells when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function was reduced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCul1</TIMEX>. This shows that normal
        E2F <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">downregulation</ENAMEX> is delayed or slowed by reduction in SCF
        function.
        Although the dominant negative action of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mCul1</ENAMEX> in 
        Drosophila was unanticipated, it
        offers a fortuitously convenient tool for the analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cul1 mutant</ENAMEX> is less useful
        because maternal contributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Cul1</ENAMEX> are so large that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">homozygous mutant animals</ENAMEX> develop to pupariation.
        Additionally, unlike the spatially restricted expression of
        mCul1, the strong Cul1 mutant alleles result in lethality.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> and generality of the defects make analysis of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cul1</NUMEX> mutant phenotype particularly difficult. In
        contrast, the induced expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mCul1</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> disc
        does not compromise viability and it gives a distinctive
        graded phenotype well suited for the study of genetic
        modification. While the basis for the dominant negative
        effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mCul1</TIMEX> remains unknown, it is important to
        recognize that inactivation of the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cul1</ENAMEX> is
        incomplete so that a reduced level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX> activity
        persists. One likely explanation for the negative effect is
        that mCul1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overexpression</ENAMEX> leads to sequestration of some
        limiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> components into weakly active <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is consistent with the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mCul1</ENAMEX> retains
        some positive function in flies as revealed by its ability
        to prolong survival of 
        dCul1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant flies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.-K.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hériché</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.H. O'Farrell</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
        The essentially complete suppression of the mCul1
        phenotype by reduction of the genetic dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> suggests
        a remarkable level of specificity, in which, among the many
        targets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX> action, the destruction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> appears to
        be particularly important. Similarly, limitations of Cul1
        function in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> also uncovered the
        disproportionate importance of particular substrates. For
        example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX> mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> result in the accumulation
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> substrate cyclin E but not of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> another well
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">characterized SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Among all of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrates</ENAMEX> targeted for degradation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , it is the failure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degrade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sic1</ENAMEX> that underlies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the G1</TIMEX> arrest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cdc53</TIMEX> mutants
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, different substrates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> appear
        to have particularly high dependence on SCF activity in
        different biological contexts. We suggest that our
        experimental context using mCul1 expression in the wing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disc</ENAMEX> is particularly effective in exposing the involvement
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">E2F</ENAMEX> destruction.
        Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> function in conjunction with a
        variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that act as specificity factors,
        mutations in individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ought to affect
        particular subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> substrates. In an extensive
        screen for loci that modify the reduction of function
        phenotype for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX>, we identified the gene encoding the
        F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Slimb</ENAMEX> as a modifier, and we failed to detect
        contributions of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-box</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoding genes</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. This implicates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> in the action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> on
        E2F. Analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> levels revealed that cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> levels were absent when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slimb</ENAMEX> function
        was severely reduced. Note that the severity of this E2F
        destruction phenotype in comparison to the mild defect in
        cell cycle programming of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">E2F</ENAMEX> destruction upon mCul1
        expression is entirely consistent with the fact that the 
        slimb mutant gives a stronger loss of
        function than the reduction of function imposed by mCul1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX>. The absence of cell cycle oscillation in
        E2F presence in the 
        slimb mutant suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> Slmbis
        responsible for targeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> for S phase destruction. If
        this destruction is the consequence of direct action of SCF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slmbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX>, we would expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to interact
        with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX>. We confirmed this prediction by pull-down
        experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the
        interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> is dependent on
        phosphorylation, as expected for the interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with their substrates. We suggest that the S phase
        specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">E2F</ENAMEX> destruction is regulated by a targeting
        phosphorylation event, but we have not yet investigated
        this level of the regulation.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> was previously implicated in the destruction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F-1</ENAMEX> in mammals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this earlier</TIMEX> study appears to
        focus on a distinct action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX>. The starting point for
        the analysis was an interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F-1 and Skp2</TIMEX>, an
        F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is not the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">homolog</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX>.
        Mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F-1</ENAMEX> that disrupted this interaction
        increased E2F-1 stability in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transfection</ENAMEX> experiments.
        However, there was no demonstration that this interaction
        was involved in or required for cell cycle oscillations in
        the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F-1</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Skp2</TIMEX> knockout cells show
        no defect in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F-1</ENAMEX> degradation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F-1</ENAMEX> proteins
        unable to interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skp2</ENAMEX> are still unstable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Our results implicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Slmbrather</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skp2in</ENAMEX> cell
        cycle specific destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> and argue that this
        regulation is critical for cell viability at least in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>. As a unifying view, we propose that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Skp2</NUMEX>-mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Slimb</ENAMEX>-mediated control of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> activities occur
        at different times during the cell cycle and that SCF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slmbis</ENAMEX> responsible for the rapid destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> in S
        phase.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> is a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX>
        transition, it is not clear why S phase destruction of E2F
        is required. However, we note that 
        slimb mutant cells do not replicate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> normally and the replication defect is correlated with
        an increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> in individual cells. This observation is
        consistent with previous reports indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> can
        limit DNA replication both in mammalian cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and in
        flies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . This enigmatic feature of E2F regulation
        suggests that its continued presence has a negative effect
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and indicates that we still have much to
        learn about its roles in cell cycle regulation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Slmbappears</ENAMEX> to influence other cell cycle events,
        perhaps by actions on other substrates, or perhaps as a
        result of events that are secondary to its influence on E2F
        destruction. For example, a 
        slimb allele shows defects in
        centrosome duplication control [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , and 
        slimb null cells undergo apoptosis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . Both effects could be explained by a failure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX>, as E2F promotes centrosome duplication in
        mammalian cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> can induce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . A link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slimb</ENAMEX> function and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RB</ENAMEX>/E2F
        pathway of cell proliferation control is also suggested by
        the genetic interaction between the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans slimb ortholog 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lin-23</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBF</ENAMEX> ortholog 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lin-35</ENAMEX> in which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lin</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> function limits the severity
        of the loss of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lin-23</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBF</ENAMEX> is an
        important modifier of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> activity, perhaps this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> is a reflection of the action of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lin</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lin</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX>. However, in our experimental situation,
        we did not observe any modification of the mCul1
        overexpression phenotype by mutations in either the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBF</ENAMEX> or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> gene, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX>.
        This result suggests that these factors are not limiting
        factors in this situation or that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E2F</ENAMEX> acts independently of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX>. The latter hypothesis is the most likely
        explanation for the lack of an RBF interaction for the
        following reason. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E2F/RBF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has to be disrupted
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> to drive cells into S phase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2F</ENAMEX> degradation
        occurs after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> phase transition which only happens
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> has been released from its association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RBF</ENAMEX>.
        According to this view, we would predict that the
        mCul1-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> should be specifically sensitive to
        factors impinging on the elimination of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> activity during
        S phase, and factors involved in the unknown processes by
        which persistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> has negative outcome.
        Consequently, this experimental system may provide an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avenue</ENAMEX> for the genetic dissection of this mysterious facet
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E2F</NUMEX> function.
      
      
        Conclusions
        To explore potential roles for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cul1</TIMEX> in cell cycle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster , we overexpressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> Cul1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mCul1</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal disc. We found that
        this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading
        to a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function. We used the resulting small
        wing phenotype in a modifier screen to identify mutations
        in cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> capable of dominantly modifying the
        mCul1-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>. We found that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX> loss-of-function
        mutations were the strongest modifiers as they completely
        suppressed the phenotype. The reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mCul1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX> also correlated with a
        failure to downregulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> normally in S phase.
        Additionally, mutations in 
        slimb that reduced the function of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Slimb enhanced the phenotype and led to
        persistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> in S phase cells. Finally, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interacts</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">E2F</NUMEX> in vitro. These results indicate
        that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Slmbcomplex</ENAMEX> is involved in regulating E2F
        activity during S phase.

          Identification of fly Cul1 and Skp1
          orthologs
          We identified several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead ESTs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Genome</ENAMEX> Project database. Sequencing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
          the corresponding cDNAs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LD20253</ENAMEX>, obtained from Genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>) revealed that it encodes a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> identity to the mouse and human Cul1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Expression of this cDNA in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> is able to
          rescue the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdc53-1</ENAMEX> mutation (not shown) indicating that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can perform at least some of the functions of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast Cul1</ENAMEX>. We used the same strategy to identify a
          Skp1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> that also rescues skp1 mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> (not
          shown). Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> genome contains several
          Skp1-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, we call the fly <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Skp1</NUMEX> homologue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dSkpA</ENAMEX>.

          wings were significantly shorter and a suppressor if they
          were clearly longer. Mutations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome were
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recombined with

          used to detect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2F</TIMEX>. Following this, the discs were
          processed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX> detection as previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          ] . Images were taken with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton Instruments</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX>
          camera on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympus</ENAMEX> inverted microscope using the
          DeltaVision microscopy system software. Cubitus
          interruptus was detected using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> monoclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody 2A1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . To compare <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels, control
          and mCul1-expressing discs were processed together. E2F
          mRNA was detected by in situ hybridisation using an
          antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . A sense probe used
          as control gave no signal. To compare levels, discs were
          processed together.
