        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been found to
        be interrupted by selfish genetic elements translated in
        frame with their host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. During post translational
        processing these elements excise themselves out of the host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] for recent reviews). The
        sequences removed during splicing are called inteins (short
        for internal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>); the portions of the host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are
        termed exteins (external <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        Inteins facilitate their excision out of the host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> without the help of any known host specific
        activity. This phenomenon, called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein splicing</ENAMEX>, was
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> discovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a decade ago</TIMEX> in the 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae V-ATPase
        catalytic subunit A [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Intein excision depends on
        the splicing domain of the intein and the first amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        residue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-extein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The inteins known to date
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 134 and 608</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long, and they have
        been reported from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> domains of life: eukaryotes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eubacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pietrokovski</ENAMEX>'s webpage on inteins
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX>blocks.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fhcrc</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/~pietro/inteins/</ENAMEX>currently lists
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> inteins in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] . The host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are diverse in function, including
        metabolic enzymes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerases</ENAMEX>, gyrases,
        proteases, ribonucleotide reductases, and vacuolar and
        archaeal type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPases</ENAMEX>. Common features suggested for these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are their expression during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        and their low substitution rate during evolution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Most reported inteins are composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domains: one
        is responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein splicing</ENAMEX>, and the other has
        endonuclease activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . The function of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonuclease</ENAMEX> is to spread the intein to intein-free
        homologs of the host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. During this process, called
        homing, the gene encoding the intein-free homolog is
        cleaved by the endonuclease at or close to the intein
        integration site. During the repair of the cleaved gene,
        the intein is copied to the previously intein-free homolog.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gimble</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorner</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] demonstrated intein homing in 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">engineered V-ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from which the intein encoding
        portion had been previously removed. However, some inteins
        lack the endonuclease domain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inteins</ENAMEX> without this domain
        perform autocatalytic splicing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . Homing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonucleases</ENAMEX> and the process of homing have been more
        intensively studied in self splicing introns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and
        the process is assumed to be similar for inteins.
        
        Thermoplasma acidophilum is among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sixteen</ENAMEX> archaea for which inteins have been reported to
        date (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intein</ENAMEX> database
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">neb.com/inteins/int_reg.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX>
        of the genus 
        Thermoplasma lack cell walls and
        possess a cytoskeleton. They live in hot and acidic
        environments, and are often found adhering to sulfur
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum grows optimally at
        59Â°C and at an external pH between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . A
        cytoplasmic pH of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.5</NUMEX> has been measured indirectly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proton</ENAMEX> pumping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases/ATPsynthases</ENAMEX> are found in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of present day organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The typical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeal ATPsynthase</ENAMEX> is homologous to the eukaryotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuolar ATPase</ENAMEX>. Because of the high degree of sequence
        similarity the archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase (A-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX>) is
        sometimes labeled as vacuolar or V-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPase</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeal</ENAMEX> and the vacuolar ATPase are both homologous to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bacterial F-ATPases</ENAMEX>, but the level of sequence similarity
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-ATPases</ENAMEX> is much lower than between the V- and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-ATPases</ENAMEX>. To date <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have been identified
        to harbor inteins in their ATPase catalytic subunits. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intein was discovered in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">vma -1</ENAMEX> gene of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . The yeast 
        Candida tropicalis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] possesses
        an intein in the same location. Inteins are also present in
        the A subunit of the A-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPases</ENAMEX> of 
        Thermoplasma acidophilum, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> volcanium,
        Pyrococcus abysii, P. horikoshii and 
        P. furiosus. 
        Here we present data on the cloning and expression of
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum A-ATPase A subunit in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, and we discuss implications
        for the location, propagation and distribution of inteins
        among organisms.

          Sequence analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX>
          acidophilumintein
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum intein was
          discovered while sequencing the catalytic subunit of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeal ATPase/ATPsynthase</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum for systematic
          purposes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . More recently, the complete genome
          sequences of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acidophilum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volcanii</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] have been
          reported. In both instances, the catalytic subunit of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPsynthase</ENAMEX> is the only gene in the entire genome for
          which an intein was reported. Using PSI-BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] with
          different inteins as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>, divergent inteins with less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent sequence identity as compared to the
          query sequence are recovered (data not shown); however,
          using this approach we did not discover any additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intein</ENAMEX> or homing endonuclease encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum. 
          Multiple sequence alignments of diverse intein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> motifs composed of moderately
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 28</NUMEX> ] . The A-ATPase A subunit of
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
          Pyrococcus intein multiple sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> (with manual modification) is shown in figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum intein (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long) is among the shortest inteins known, and the
          alignment with other inteins reveals the absence of
          sequences homologous to the typical endonuclease motifs.
          Only the motifs characteristic for the self splicing
          domain are present in the 
          Thermoplasma intein (see figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The significance of the match between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum and the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrococcal ATPase</ENAMEX> inteins was assessed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRSS</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://fasta.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioch</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">virginia</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/fasta/prss.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          The P-value for this match, i.e. the probability of
          obtaining a match of this quality by chance alone, was
          calculated to be below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -10</NUMEX>. This indicates that not
          only the exteins, but also the inteins themselves are
          recognizably homologous. In contrast, a sequence
          alignment of all known inteins shows intein sequences to
          be much more divergent (not shown). For example, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-value for the comparison between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum and the 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae intein was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.28</NUMEX>, i.e. no significant similarity between the yeast
          and the 
          Thermoplasma inteins was detectable
          using pairwise alignments only.
        
        
          Location of the intein within the host
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein</ENAMEX>
          The vacuolar and the archaeal ATPases are homologous
          to the bacterial and organellar <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATPases</ENAMEX>. The
          structure of the bovine mitochondrial F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> has been determined by X-ray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystallography</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . The intein insertion points in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yeasts</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
          Pyrococcus A-ATPases correspond to
          the catalytic site where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binds and is hydrolyzed
          during the catalytic cycle. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2shows</TIMEX> that the
          inteins are located in the regions of these very
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] that have the lowest
          substitution rates.
        
        
          Comparison of A-ATPase catalytic subunit and 16S
          rRNA phylogeny
          The phylogenies of archaeal ATPase catalytic subunits
          and small subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNAs</ENAMEX> are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenies</ENAMEX> were calculated for a similar set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. While the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phylogenies show some significant
          differences, neither of them groups the molecules from 
          Thermoplasma with the 
          Pyrococcus homologs. In both
          phylogenies several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>, i.e., 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. jannaschii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. thermolithotrophicus</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thermococcus sp</ENAMEX>., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>.,

          Methanobacterium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermoautotrophicus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> off between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
          that carry inteins in their ATPase catalytic subunits.
          All of these intervening archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> do not carry an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intein</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage comparison
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage varies among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The production of
          tRNAs corresponds to the frequencies with which the
          different codons are present in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> coding
          genes. The exact causes for tRNA regulation and codon
          usage are not completely understood; however, expression
          of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is often prevented by a
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage of the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Many
          Archaea have codon usage frequencies and tRNA
          compositions different from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum A-ATPase A subunit
          has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">763</NUMEX> codons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codon AUA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile</ENAMEX>) is the most frequent
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39/1000</NUMEX>). In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> the same codon (AUA) is a
          rare codon present at a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5.5</NUMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>.
          The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage between
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum A-ATPase A subunit
          and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX>)
          which are present in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum A-ATPase A subunit
          at frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">41 and 16</NUMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> respectively. In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> however, these codons are
          considered rare and occur with frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>
          per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> respectively.
        
        
          Expression and intein splicing of T.
          acidophilumA-ATPase A subunit
          The gene encoding the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum A-ATPase A subunit
          was cloned into the expression vector pET-11a
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>) and transformed into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli Bl21</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli Bl21</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CodonPlus</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>)-RIL
          strain for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression. When 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli Bl21</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>), a strain that
          did not express additional rare tRNAs, was transformed
          with the cloned 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum ATPase A subunit, no
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein bands</ENAMEX> were observed in extracts of
          induced cells (not shown). However, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli Bl21</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CodonPlus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DE3</NUMEX>)-RIL
          strain transformed with the same plasmid expresses two
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 and 65</NUMEX> kDalton upon induction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). No additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> kDa, indicative of an
          unprocessed intein, was visible after induction. This
          demonstrates that autocatalytic splicing occurred
          efficiently in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Efficient autocatalytic
          splicing was also observed when the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> were grown and induced at
          42Â°C, or when the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> were induced at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). During preparation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> gel
          electrophoreses the samples are heated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72Â°C</NUMEX> in the
          presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>. With respect to temperature these
          conditions are more similar to the conditions in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum cytoplasm than the
          conditions in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Intein excision might
          occur only during this high temperature treatment.
          Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from induced 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> were also separated under
          non-denaturing conditions with or without addition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>. The induced bands were excised from the
          non-denaturating gel and separated using denaturing SDS
          gel electrophoresis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Both of the slower
          migrating bands visible after induction (A and B in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> corresponding to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spliced</ENAMEX> and religated A-subunit upon separation in an SDS
          denaturing gel. Presumably the slower migrating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was

        Discussion
        The 
        Daucus carota [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Alireza
        Senejani unpublished) catalytic V-ATPase subunits form
        inclusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> when expressed in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum subunit is expressed
        as a soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli cytoplasm</ENAMEX>. Despite the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> and physical differences between the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli cytoplasm</ENAMEX> and the environment
        in which the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum intein is functioning 
        in vivo, we found no indications that
        self-splicing of the intein was inefficient in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Even when 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> was grown at lower
        temperatures, processing of the intein and religation of
        the exteins appeared <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> efficient. Complete processing
        was also observed when the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli proteins</ENAMEX> were separated in
        non-denaturing and non-reducing gels. Autocatalytic
        splicing of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum A-ATPase catalytic
        subunit occurs efficiently in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli cytoplasm</ENAMEX>. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum A-ATPase intein
        appears to splice out efficiently at very different pHs
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 33</NUMEX> ] ) and temperatures (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 to 37Â°</NUMEX>
        versus 55Â°C [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ).
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum intein shows
        significant sequence similarity to the inteins found in the
        A-ATPase catalytic subunits of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX>. Moreover, these inteins
        are inserted into the same highly conserved sequence in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding site. This indicates that the inteins in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
        Pyrococcus are homologous in the
        evolutionary sense, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, they are derived from a common
        ancestral gene. However, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> and 
        Thermoplasma are not considered
        closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. Based on their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA they are
        considered distantly related <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Euryarchaeotes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">See Fig</ENAMEX>.
        3b).
        One explanation for the discrepancy between phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> and distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-ATPase</ENAMEX> intein is
        horizontal gene transfer: the intein was not present in the
        last common ancestor of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
        Pyrococcus, rather the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intein</ENAMEX> invaded
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the lineages after their split and was more recently
        horizontally transferred to the other lineage. The
        horizontal transfer scenario is more parsimonious than the
        assumption of presence in the shared common ancestor
        because the latter requires several independently occurring
        losses of the intein together with its long-term
        persistence in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> and 
        Thermoplasma lineages ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cf. Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b). Horizontal transfer of
        whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and operons between divergent species is a
        frequent event [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . Even house keeping genes
        are transferred between divergent species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> possibilities exist for the horizontal transfer
        scenario. Either the whole A-ATPase catalytic subunits was
        transferred, or the intein alone spread as a selfish
        genetic element. To discriminate between these two
        scenarios, we constructed the phylogeny of the host protein
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). The resulting phylogeny is in reasonable
        agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal rRNA phylogeny</ENAMEX>, the main
        exception being the placement of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desulfurococcus</ENAMEX>. According to its 16S
        rRNA this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> is clearly classified as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarcheote</ENAMEX>; however, its ATPase catalytic subunit groups
        with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thermococcus sp</ENAMEX>. The finding that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> protein itself does not group the genus 
        Thermoplasma with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyrococci</ENAMEX> suggests that the intein
        alone was transferred between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
        Pyrococcus, and that the sequence
        similarity between the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> and 
        Pyrococcus catalytic subunits was
        sufficient to allow homing into the same insertion
        site.
        The dispersion of the intein as a selfish genetic
        element is consistent with the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goddard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] on the persistence of an intron with homing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonuclease</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast mitochondria</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> studied
        the distribution of empty target sites, and introns with
        and without a functioning endonuclease gene among different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yeasts</ENAMEX>. They concluded that the long term persistence of
        the intron depends on a cycle that begins with invasion of
        the empty target site by an intron with the help of a
        homing endonuclease encoded by an open reading frame within
        the intron. However, once the intron containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">allele</ENAMEX> is
        fixed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the endonuclease, which itself had
        been the reason for the rapid spread of the intron in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, is no longer under selection, the endonuclease
        becomes non-functional and is lost, resulting in an intron
        without homing endonuclease activity. However, once the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonuclease</ENAMEX> is lost the intron containing allele becomes
        more likely to be replaced with an allele that has lost the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">intron</ENAMEX> altogether and the cycle of invasion and successive
        loss begins anew.
        The process of intein homing is likely to depend on a
        similar cycle; however, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time</TIMEX> intervals for loss of the
        intein are likely to be longer than the loss of the intron.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-ATPase</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inteins</ENAMEX> are located in the
        most conserved part of the host gene. Any deletion of the
        intein from the gene itself needs to be precise, because
        any alteration of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> in the catalytic
        site is likely to result in a non-functioning enzyme.
        Comparative sequence analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) shows that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> volcanium inteins do not contain
        an endonuclease domain. Our search of the genomes of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> did not identify any endonucleases that might
        function in homing. While the failure to identify a homing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonuclease</ENAMEX> is not proof of absence, the presence of a
        homing endonuclease acting in trans would be unprecedented
        and has to be regarded as improbable. The cyclic reinvasion
        model for long term persistence of a selfish genetic
        element through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homing</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] suggests that the small 
        Thermoplasma intein evolved through
        reduction from a large endonuclease containing intein
        similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> found in the pyrococcal A-ATPase.
        Apparently, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intein</ENAMEX> has been persisting in the 
        Thermoplasma A-ATPase since the split
        between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> volcanium without the help of a
        homing endonuclease.
        The cyclic reinvasion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> also explains why the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> site is in a region of very low substitution
        rates: The high degree of sequence similarity surrounding
        the integration point facilitates the intein transfer
        between different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> using the homing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonuclease</ENAMEX>. A more variable sequence surrounding the
        integration point would restrict homing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        same species, and would thus lower the chances for long
        term survival of the intein.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The small intein in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-ATPase</ENAMEX> is closely
        related to the endonuclease containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intein</ENAMEX> in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-ATPase</ENAMEX>. Phylogenies
        constructed with the host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (A-ATPase catalytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX>) and with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX> do not group these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organisms
        together, suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-ATPase</ENAMEX> intein spread
        through horizontal gene transfer. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intein</ENAMEX> has
        persisted in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> apparently without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homing</ENAMEX>. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. acidophilum intein</ENAMEX> retains
        efficient self-splicing activity when expressed in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. This activity does not
        depend on the physicochemical conditions in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> acidophilum cytoplasm.

          sliding window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> aligned positions. The window is
          moved through the alignment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> position at a time. For
          positions where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> of the sequences have a
          gap, the average number of substitutions was calculated
          considering the gap as an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>. Positions
          with gaps in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> of the aligned sequences were
          skipped.
          Phylogenies were reconstructed from amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> aligned using <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CLUSTAL X</ENAMEX> 1.8 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . The
          topologies of the depicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were calculated using
          neighbor joining as implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CLUSTAL X</ENAMEX> with
          correction for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple substitutions</ENAMEX>. Branch lengths and
          their confidence intervals were calculated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TREE-PUZZLE 5.0</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JTT</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HKY</ENAMEX> model for
          substitution respectively, and assuming an among site
          rate variation described by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution.
          Bootstrap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were analyzed using parsimony as
          implemented in PAUP* <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> beta <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] treating gaps as
          missing data. Each bootstrapped sample was analyzed using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different starting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> built through random
          addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-branch-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping,
          and considering gaps as missing data. The following
          sequences were used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16S</TIMEX> rRNA phylogeny (the
