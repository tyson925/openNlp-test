        Nontypeable 
        Haemophilus influenzae is an
        important human respiratory tract <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogen</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> causes acute otitis media as established by
        pure culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> from middle ear fluid during
        disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . In addition, nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae has been implicated as
        a cause of otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with effusion, which refers to the
        presence of fluid in the middle ear in the absence of acute
        symptoms. Acute otitis media and otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with effusion
        represent an enormous health problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> worldwide
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . A large amount of effort has been devoted to
        understanding the pathogenesis of otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with a goal
        toward developing ways to prevent the disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 13 14</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Many middle ear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with otitis media
        with effusion are sterile by culture. However, assays using
        the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae is present in a
        substantial proportion of these middle ear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, reverse transcriptase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> have shown the presence of bacterial mRNA,
        indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are present in a viable and
        metabolically active but non-culturable state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        These observations suggest that in otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with
        effusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are in a physiological state which
        differs from that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> growing planktonically in a
        free floating phase. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have proposed that in
        otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with effusion, nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae grow in the form of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biofilm</ENAMEX> in the middle ear [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 22 23</NUMEX> ] .
        A biofilm is a structured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of bacterial cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enveloped</ENAMEX> in a self-produced polymeric matrix and adherent
        to an inert or living surface [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 24</NUMEX> ] . It is estimated
        that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in nature are attached to a surface
        in the form of a biofilm. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in
        the form of biofilms have been recognized as important
        causes of a variety of human infections, including
        infections of prosthetic devices, endocarditis, dental
        caries, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> in cystic fibrosis, prostatitis and
        others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . Biofilms are more resistant to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> clearance mechanisms and to antibiotics compared to
        planktonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] . In order to develop
        strategies to treat and prevent infections caused by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in biofilms, including otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with effusion,
        it will be important to elucidate the characteristics of
        bacterial pathogens as biofilms.
        In addition to being a common cause of otitis media,
        nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae colonizes the lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> tract of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with chronic obstructive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary disease</ENAMEX> (COPD) and is an important cause of
        exacerbations of the disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 31</ENAMEX> ] . An ongoing
        prospective study of bacterial infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center</ENAMEX> has revealed
        interesting features regarding the dynamics of colonization
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>. While active turnover of new strains of
        nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae occurs, some strains
        have the ability to persist for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monthly</TIMEX> sputum
        cultures reveal intermittent negative cultures in spite of
        continuous colonization by the same isolate proven by
        molecular typing, indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is present
        in spite of negative cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sputum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        unpublished observations). These observations suggest that
        nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae grows as a biofilm in
        the respiratory tract of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>, reminiscent of 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its well
        established propensity to grow as a biofilm while causing
        infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cystic fibrosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        In view of these lines of evidence suggesting that
        nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> influenzae grows as a biofilm
        during human respiratory tract infection, the goals of the
        present study are to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) Develop an assay to study biofilms
        of nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae in vitro; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
        Characterize the extent to which isolates from the middle
        ear fluid of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with otitis media and from the sputum
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> form biofilms; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) Begin to elucidate
        the characteristics of the outer membrane antigens of
        nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae during growth as a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Biofilm</ENAMEX> formation by clinical isolates
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> isolates recovered from the sputum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> isolates recovered from the middle ear
          fluid of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> were studied for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1aand 1bshow</TIMEX> that striking
          differences were observed among strains with regard to
          the ability to form biofilms. Values depicted in the bar
          graphs represent the mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent
          experiments performed in quadriplicate. The error bars
          represent the standard deviation. Although some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in values was seen, the level of biofilm
          formation was highly consistent from experiment to
          experiment. Strains which formed good biofilms (e.g.,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strains 5P11H1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6P8H1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13P26H1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31P13H1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">56P40H1</ENAMEX> and
          74P10H1 from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> which formed poor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biofims</ENAMEX> (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5P10H1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6P5H</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7P49H1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6P32H1 and 13P33H1</TIMEX>)
          do so consistently. Inspection of Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1reveals</TIMEX> that
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot readily divide strains into those which form
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biofilms</ENAMEX> and those which do not. Rather, a broad range of
          ability to form biofilms was seen among these randomly
          chosen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> clinical isolates.
        
        
          Conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation
          In an effort to identify growth conditions which might
          result in increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> strains
          which showed a range of ability to form biofilms were
          chosen for further study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> isolates
          from middle ear fluid (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">955, 1826, 1749, 9289</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          isolates from the sputum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">74P10H1,</ENAMEX>
          5P11H1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5P10H1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14P13H1</TIMEX>). The following reagents were
          added individually to aliquots of media: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> sucrose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>.
          A biofilm assay was performed and the results were
          compared with biofilms in growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for each of the
          strains. None of the added reagents caused an increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation for any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Biofilm growth curve
          To characterize the kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation, the
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation was measured at selected time
          points over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> period for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> strains. Figure 2shows
          that a gradual increase in biofilm is seen over
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 hours</TIMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 16 hours</TIMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation shows a leveling off and the optical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> remains relatively stable to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> at an
          optical density which is characteristic of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          strains.
        
        
          Expression of outer membrane antigens during growth
          as a biofilm
          To preliminarily assess the expression of outer
          membrane antigens by nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae during growth as
          biofilms, cell envelopes of strain 74P10H1 grown as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biofilm</ENAMEX> in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> well plate were purified. Simultaneously,
          cell envelopes of strain 74P10H1 grown on agar plates
          were purified by the same method. Figure 3is a Coomassie
          blue stained gel of cell envelopes of strain 74P10H1
          grown on agar medium compared to cell envelopes of the
          same strain grown as a biofilm. Differences are noted in
          minor bands and differences in the intensity of bands are
          noted. The major bands appear similar in the two
          preparations.
          To further assess the expression of epitopes on
          selected individual outer membrane antigens, purified
          cell envelopes were assayed in immunoblot assays with
          well characterized polyclonal and monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
          Polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to a peptide corresponding to loop
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the outer membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> P2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , which is the
          only known porin of nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae , revealed expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> grown as a biofilm and in
          planktonically grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Similarly, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> recognized by monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to outer
          membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein P5</ENAMEX>, an OMP A-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P6</ENAMEX>, a
          highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in all strains of nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae , were expressed in
          the outer membranes of cells grown as biofilms and cells
          grown planktonically (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          When <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown on agar plates using the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> as for growth in biofilms (brain heart infusion +
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemin</ENAMEX> + nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), the
          expression of a lipooligosaccharide epitope was reduced
          compared to the level of expression in biofilms (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This epitope appears to be expressed at similar
          levels as in biofilms when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are grown on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate agar</ENAMEX> and in brain heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infusion broth</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown). Bacteria grow more slowly on the brain heart
          infusion agar compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate agar</ENAMEX>. The observation
          that the expression of epitopes on outer membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins P2</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P5 and P6</TIMEX> was similar in biofilms and agar
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) indicates that the alteration in expression of
          the epitope on lipooligosaccharide is not explained by
          slow growth, but represents altered expression of
          lipooligosacharide under different growth conditions.
        
        
          Role of pili in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation
          To assess the potential role of pili in biofilm
          formation, a variant of a strain of nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae which lacks
          expression of pili was tested for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation along
          with its isogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> strain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strain M37-1</ENAMEX> lacks
          expression of pili as indicated by absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemagglutination</ENAMEX> and absence of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
          corresponding to pilin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . In an experiment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">comparing biofilm</ENAMEX> formation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> duplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, strain
          M37-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the pilus deficient variant, yielded an average
          optical density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.204</NUMEX> whereas its isogenic parent
          strain, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M37</TIMEX>, yielded an average optical density of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.884</NUMEX>.
          This experiment was repeated multiple times and the pilus
          deficient variant showed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 4</TIMEX> fold decrease in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation compared to its isogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> strain
          in every experiment.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Assays of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> randomly chosen clinical isolates from the
        middle ear of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with otitis media and from the
        sputum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> show that isolates of
        nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae demonstrate striking
        differences in their propensity to grow as biofilms in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX>. These differences are highly reproducible in that
        individual isolates show similar levels of biofilm
        formation on repeated experiments
        The assay for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation used in this study is
        based on the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to adhere to plastic wells
        in microtiter plates. This method has been used to study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation by a variety of other <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-positive and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . The method has
        both advantages and disadvantages compared to studying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation in flow cells, the other widely used
        method. The microtiter plate assay yields reproducible
        results and is convenient, allowing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to study large
        numbers of strains and conditions. Furthermore, the method
        yields quantitative results, based on measuring the optical
        density of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. An important potential limitation of the
        microtiter plate method is that one might question whether
        the method is capable of distinguishing true biofilm
        formation from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> simply adhering to plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> lines of evidence suggest that the method is measuring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watnick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] showed
        by confocal laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microscopy</ENAMEX> that the morphology of
        biofilms of 
        Vibrio cholerae grown on cover slips
        in static culture is similar to the morphology of biofilms
        grown in a flow cell. And <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, with regard to this
        study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> polyacrylamide gel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and expression of lipooligosaccharide
        epitopes are different in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> recovered from biofilms
        grown in micotiter <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> compared to planktonic cells grown
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. These observations suggest that the assay is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detecting bacteria</ENAMEX> as biofilms rather than simply measuring
        planktonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> adhering to plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. However,
        more definitive answers regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation in
        human infection caused by nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae awaits detailed studies
        involving confocal laser microscopy of clinical samples
        containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
        The importance of nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae as a human respiratory
        tract <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogen</ENAMEX>, has stimulated a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of research to
        elucidate the antigenic characteristics of the outer
        membrane of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. This work is important in

        the human immune response to infection and guiding vaccine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. This large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of work has been performed
        exclusively on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> grown planktonically. In view of
        the mounting evidence that nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae grows as a biofilm in
        otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> with effusion and in the respiratory tract of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>, it will be important to characterize the
        bacterial surface antigens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> during growth as
        a biofilm. The present study used well characterized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyclonal</ENAMEX> and monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to begin to address
        this important question.
        P2, the major outer membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the outer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> is the only known porin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae. Immunoblot assays with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiserum</ENAMEX> raised to a conserved surface exposed loop of P2
        showed that expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">P2</ENAMEX> was similar in amount,
        molecular mass, and immunoreactivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> grown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planktonically</ENAMEX> and as a biofilm. This observation is in
        contrast to expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porin proteins</ENAMEX> of 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pseudomonas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aeruginosa</ENAMEX> whose
        expression are altered during growth as a biofilm [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Similarly, expression of outer membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein P5</ENAMEX>, an
        OMP A-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P6</ENAMEX>, a highly conserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, is preserved in cells grown as biofilms based on
        immunoblot assays with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        The expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P5 and P6</TIMEX> in biofilms is especially
        important since these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are under consideration as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine antigens</ENAMEX>. Finally, alteration of expression of an
        epitope on lipooligosaccharide suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
        expresses a different lipooligosaccharide molecule during
        growth as a biofilm. Similarly, expression of
        lipopolysaccharide of 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa is altered
        during growth as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biofilms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . These studies of outer
        membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> expression are limited by the sensitivity
        of immunoblot assays. While the assays establish that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX>,
        P5 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P6</ENAMEX> and the epitopes recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> are
        expressed in biofilms and that expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipooligosaccharide</ENAMEX> is altered, one must be cautious in
        drawing firm conclusions regarding the level of expression
        and the surface accessibility of the epitopes recognized by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> based on results of immunoblot assays alone
        because they are not quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX>.
        An isogenic variant of nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae deficient in expression
        in pili showed a marked reduction in the ability to grow as
        a biofilm. This observation parallels that made in several
        other bacterial species showing the pili are critical in
        the early stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 41</NUMEX> ] .
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report of formation of biofilms
        by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae . Work on biofilm
        formation by nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae should focus in several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. It will be important to define more precisely the
        extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> grows as biofilms during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colonization</ENAMEX> and infection of the human respiratory tract.
        The biofilm of many bacterial species is composed of
        extracellular polysaccharide such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">capsule</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] .
        Since nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae does not express a
        capsule, it will be interesting to characterize the
        composition of the biofilm. As the role of biofilms in
        human infection becomes better defined, elucidating the
        human immune response to antigens expressed during growth
        as biofilms may be important in understanding host
        responses and in devising strategies to prevent infection
        by nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae. 
      
      
        Conclusions
        Nontypeable 
        Haemophilus influenzae forms biofilms
        in vitro. Clinical isolates show substantial variability in
        their ability to grow as biofilms. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> major outer
        membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P5 and P6</TIMEX>, are expressed during
        growth as a biofilm. Expression of an epitope on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipooligosaccharide</ENAMEX> is altered during growth as a biofilm.
        Pili are important in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation. As the role of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biofilms</ENAMEX> in human infection becomes better defined,
        characterization of biofilms may be important in
        understanding the pathogenesis of infection and immune
        response to nontypeable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with otitis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Bacterial strains
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> isolates of nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae were studied. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX>
          were isolated from the sputum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> as
          part of a prospective study being conducted at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center</ENAMEX>. The isolates
          recovered from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> were proven to be
          distinct strains of nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae based on outer
          membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> patterns [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 44</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> isolates
          were recovered from the middle ear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> obtained by
          tympanocentesis from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with otitis media. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twelve</NUMEX>
          were from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>; 1 from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>; 1
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>.
          Nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae strain M37 and an
          isogenic variant designated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">M37</NUMEX>-1 which is deficient in
          expression of pili were kindly provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Munson</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate agar</ENAMEX> or in brain
          heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infusion broth supplemented</ENAMEX> with hemin and
          nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide both at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 Î¼g/ml.</ENAMEX> In
          the experiments to compare cell envelopes of bacteria
          grown planktonically with those grown as biofilms,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown on brain heart infusion agar
          supplemented as noted above. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> was supplemented with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX>, sucrose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> in selected
          experiments as described in the Results.
        
        
          Biofilm growth assay
          The assay to grow and quantitate nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae biofilms was
          essentially the same assay which has been used for
          several other bacterial species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . An
          overnight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX> culture was diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200</ENAMEX> in fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î</NUMEX>¼l was inoculated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well
          Linbro tissue culture plate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICN Biomedical, Inc.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aurora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>). The plates were incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. Before biofilm
          quantitation, growth was assessed by measuring the
          optical density at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">490 nm</NUMEX> (OD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">490</NUMEX> ) in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">BioRad</ENAMEX> plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>. To
          quantitate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biofilm</ENAMEX> formation, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Difco</ENAMEX> crystal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">violet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>, Sparks, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>) was added to
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> and incubated at room temperature for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wells</ENAMEX> were washed vigorously with distilled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and the plate was air dried. A volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">230 Î¼l</NUMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> was added to each well and the OD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">570</NUMEX> was measured. All strains were
          tested in quadruplicate. Each plate included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> wells
          which contained sterile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> but
          were treated identically otherwise. The OD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">570</NUMEX> was standardized against these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wells</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS PAGE</ENAMEX>) and immunoblot assays
          Cell envelopes were subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS PAGE</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue staining using previously described
          methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Immunoblot assays were performed as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . After incubating with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, blots were developed with the appropriate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine</ENAMEX> or rabbit peroxidase conjugated secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Purification of cell envelopes
          To study the outer membrane of nontypeable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown
          as a biofilm overnight in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> well Linbro tissue culture
          plate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broth</ENAMEX> was aspirated and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> were washed 3
          times with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M HEPES</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> in the
          biofilm were harvested by scraping the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> with the tip
          of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml micropipette tip. To prepare cell envelopes,
          cells were suspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M HEPES</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> and
          sonicated on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> by using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson Sonifier</ENAMEX> (small tip,
          setting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . The suspension was centrifuged at
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,000 x g</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> to remove unbroken cells
          and debris. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> x g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>. The resulting pellet was
          suspended in sample buffer and subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and
          immunoblot assay.
