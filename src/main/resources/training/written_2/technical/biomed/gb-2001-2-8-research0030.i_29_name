        The enzyme chorismate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutase</ENAMEX> performs the initial
        catalytic step of divergence to L-phenylalanine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tyrosine in aromatic biosynthesis. This reaction has long
        intrigued biochemists as the sole example of an
        enzyme-catalyzed pericyclic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claisen</ENAMEX>) rearrangement [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        The existence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (or maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>) different homology
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of chorismate mutases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) points to separate
        evolutionary origins. Such independent evolutionary origins
        of analogous enzymes that mediate the same function are
        becoming increasingly apparent [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Assigning a name to an enzyme would be vastly more
        simple if all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> belonging to a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">possessed</ENAMEX> identical substrate specificities. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        extreme, however, completely independent homology groups
        can possess the same substrate specificity; that is, a
        given function may have evolved more than once. At the
        other extreme, a single protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may possess member
        enzymes that have different substrate specificities. In
        fact, distinct and dispersed subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> having the
        same substrate specificity may exist within a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> possess an admixture of
        different substrate specificities. The latter case is
        exemplified by the Î±, Î² and Î³ subfamilies of aromatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aminotransferases</ENAMEX> within the aminotransferases of family I
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Nevertheless, the differing substrate specificities
        within the catalytic repertoire of a particular protein
        family are generally a reflection of similar reaction
        mechanisms. Therefore, it should usually be feasible to
        name a protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (or superfamily) at a hierarchical
        level that encompasses all substrate specificities of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">member proteins</ENAMEX>. Chorismate mutase, isochorismate mutase [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-amino, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-deoxychorismate mutase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], which all
        catalyze similar reactions, are common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a group
        that we have called cyclohexadienyl mutase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In
        this vein, class I cyclohexadienyl <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutases</ENAMEX> possess
        chorismate mutase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that belong to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> IÎ±
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX>) or family <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IÎ²</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroR</ENAMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> group of chorismate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroH</ENAMEX>) so far constitute the sole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
        separate homology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II cyclohexadienyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutases</ENAMEX>.
        Chorismate mutases encoded by both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroQ</ENAMEX> and 
        aroH are represented among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotes</ENAMEX>. The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroH</ENAMEX> is quite limited,
        known at this time to be present only in some 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bacillus species</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX>, B. halodurans, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. stearothermophilus</ENAMEX> ),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Synechocystis sp.,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Synechococcus sp.,</ENAMEX> 
        Nostoc punctiforme, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Anabaena sp</ENAMEX>., and
        
        Prochlorococcus marinus ), 
        Streptomyces coelicolor, and 
        Thermomonospora fusca. On the other
        hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> is widely distributed. Multiple paralogs of 
        aroQ are commonly present in a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. Genes encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroH</ENAMEX> coexist in some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-helix-bundle domains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroH</ENAMEX> proteins
        possess a trimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pseudo Î±</ENAMEX>/Î²-barrel structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. The
        AroR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (known only in eukaryotes) are structurally
        similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AroQ</ENAMEX>, deploying a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-helix-bundle structure
        around the active site. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AroQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> also
        share a colinear arrangement of amphiphilic patterns, as
        well as conserved spacing between patches of closely
        neighboring patterns in the primary sequence. Thus, AroR
        can be viewed as a version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> that has inserted loops
        related to allosteric regulation. The latter rationale is
        the basis for classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroR</ENAMEX> into the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> ([ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] and references therein) even though
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> is barely detectable at the sequence level. Both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroH</ENAMEX> are small (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 kDa</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroR</ENAMEX> is much
        larger and exhibits complex allostery, being activated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-tryptophan</ENAMEX> and inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tyrosine in the case of
        yeast [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] or being activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan and inhibited
        by both L-tyrosine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine in the case of
        higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        The 
        aroQ gene has been an extremely
        popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> for fusion with other aromatic-pathway
        genes, as illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. In 
        Archaeoglobus, aroQ encodes the
        central domain of a tripartite fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is
        flanked at the amino end by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TyrA</ENAMEX> and at the carboxyl end by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PheA</ENAMEX>. The most widely distributed 
        aroQ fusion is with 
        pheA, being present in most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> and beta proteobacteria. The 
        aroQâ€¢pheA fusion also exists in 
        Thermotoga maritima and 
        Clostridium difficile, apparently
        having arisen as independent fusion events (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.X.</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.A.J.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enteric bacteria</ENAMEX> and their
        nearest phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> possess an 
        aroQâ€¢tyrA fusion. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clostridium acetobutylicum</ENAMEX> possesses
        a so-far unique fusion of 
        aroQ with 
        aroD, the gene encoding shikimate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX>. Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> was shown to have fused
        domains specifying chorismate mutase ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroQ</ENAMEX> ) and
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-P</NUMEX> (DAHP) synthase ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroA</ENAMEX> ). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> domain was shown to
        function not only as a catalytic domain for chorismate
        mutase, but also as the allosteric domain for the fused
        AroA domain. This fusion thus provided a physical basis for
        the allosteric pattern of control called sequential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feedback inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. This 
        aroQâ€¢aroA fusion also occurs in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus</ENAMEX> and in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deinococcus</ENAMEX>. Although 
        Porphyromonas gingivalis also
        possesses fused domains of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroQ</ENAMEX> and 
        aroA, the fusion joint is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'
        end of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroQ</ENAMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the 3</TIMEX>' end.
        Among the monofunctional chorismate mutases, that
        present in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erwinia herbicola</ENAMEX> possesses a
        cleavable signal peptide and accordingly is translocated
        into the periplasm. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> herbicola chorismate mutase was
        shown [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] to be not only periplasmic but also located at
        the poles of the cells, similar to cyclohexadienyl
        dehydratase of 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. In this
        study we have examined the extent to which monofunctional
        chorismate mutases are periplasmic or cytoplasmic. A
        chorismate mutase of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella typhimurium</ENAMEX> is shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periplasmic</ENAMEX>. A periplasmic chorismate mutase in 
        P. aeruginosa is shown to be part of
        an complete three-step pathway for periplasmic conversion
        of chorismate to phenylalanine.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the biochemical pathway context of
        chorismate mutase with respect to phenylalanine and
        tyrosine biosynthesis and provides an overview of
        differences between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium and 
        P. aeruginosa. It also shows the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nomenclature</ENAMEX> used. In this era of comparative genomics, it
        is no longer tenable to use acronyms for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their
        gene products that differ from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. The
        common-pathway enzymes through chorismate synthase are
        named in order, that is [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">AroA</ENAMEX>] catalyzes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pathway
        reaction, [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">AroB</ENAMEX>] the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and so on. In cases where
        different homolog <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are known to exist, these analog
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are designated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> numerals, for example,
        AroA 
        I or AroA 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> . Different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> within a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> are usually distinguished with Î±, Î², and Î³
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designations</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the common-pathway steps are
        represented by independently evolved analog classes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. typhimurium</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> paralogs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAHP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">synthase</ENAMEX> belonging to the AroA 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IÎ±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, whereas 
        P. aeruginosa possesses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogs
        of AroA 
        IÎ± enzyme and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogs of class II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAHP</ENAMEX> synthase (AroA 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium utilizes a single
        dehydroquinase that belongs to class I (AroC 
        I ), whereas 
        P. aeruginosa deploys <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">class II</ENAMEX> (AroC 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> ). Both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium and 
        P. aeruginosa utilize class I
        shikimate kinase (AroE 
        I ), as do all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. However, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. typhimurium</ENAMEX> possesses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogs
        that are characteristic of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and its closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and
        encoded by genes labeled as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroK</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroL</ENAMEX> in the literature.
        Chorismate mutase is the focal point of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, and
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1illustrates</TIMEX> that the cytoplasm of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. typhimurium</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogs of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IÎ±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of chorismate mutases denoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX>. One is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TyrA</ENAMEX> and the other to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PheA</ENAMEX>, as indicated by the

        P. aeruginosa is similar to

          aeruginosaperiplasm
          A modified magnesium shock procedure was used to
          separate periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions of 
          P. aeruginosa cultures grown in
          minimal medium. The established periplasmic enzyme *PheC
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 16</TIMEX>] was used as a periplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein marker</ENAMEX> and
          shikimate dehydrogenase was used as a cytoplasmic protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX>. It was preferable to use prephenate rather than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-arogenate as a substrate in the assay of *PheC
          activity, not only because the assay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-arogenate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydratase</ENAMEX> is tedious [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] but also because prephenate
          is much less expensive. However, *PheC cannot be
          monitored as prephenate dehydratase in the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PheA</ENAMEX> domain of that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is prephenate dehydratase. To avoid this problem,
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aroQ â€¢</ENAMEX> 
          pheA -deficient mutant PAT1051 was
          used. All the prephenate dehydratase activity in PAT1051
          is derived from *PheC, which thus can be used as a
          convenient marker for the quality of the separation of
          the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compartments</ENAMEX>.
          *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PheC</ENAMEX> can also be selectively assayed without
          interference from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PheA</ENAMEX> in wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAO1</ENAMEX>. In the
          wild-type, the prephenate dehydratase activity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is completely inhibited by phenylalanine,
          whereas *PheC is completely insensitive. Thus, one can
          calculate the fraction of total activity contributed by
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymes by comparing activities measured
          in the presence and absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine. From
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, a calculated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX> of *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PheC</ENAMEX> was found in the
          periplasmic fraction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PAT1051</TIMEX>, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of *PheC
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from PAO1</TIMEX>.
          *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> was found in the periplasm in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. aeruginosa PAO1.</ENAMEX> None of the
          periplasmic chorismate mutase activity was attributed to
          AroQâ€¢PheA because no PheA-domain activity was detected
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Hence, the chorismate mutase activity in the
          periplasm must be exclusively *AroQ. Identification of
          this activity as *AroQ, and not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AroQâ€¢PheA</ENAMEX>, was verified
          by elution of a single peak of chorismate mutase in the
          wash fraction recovered after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mono</ENAMEX> Q chromatography of
          the periplasmic fraction. This is the established elution
          behavior of *AroQ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Of the total aromatic
          aminotransferase activity, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-20%</NUMEX> was found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periplasm</ENAMEX>.

          *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> was purified from the periplasmic fraction of

          These data affirm a technically good separation of the

          steps are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. After the last

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE after staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue. The

          r estimated by gel filtration was
          around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38,000</NUMEX>, suggesting a native homodimer structure.
          Amino-terminal amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequencing</ENAMEX> gave a sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QPLSPALQQL</ENAMEX> (in the single-letter amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid notation</ENAMEX>),
          which corresponds to a sequence beginning at residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          of gene PA5184 of the completed 
          P. aeruginosa genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          Aromatic aminotransferase (*Aat 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ²</ENAMEX> ) was purified from the periplasmic
          fraction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PAO1</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fractions with enzymatic
          activity that eluted from the gradient of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxylapatite</ENAMEX> column were chromatographed on a mono Q
          column and recovered as single peaks. The leading peak
          fractions yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> and several minor bands
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE. Amino-terminal amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequencing of
          the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSGATSAAGK</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to the
          sequence beginning with residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> of the deduced protein
          encoded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PA2531</TIMEX> in the completed 
          P. aeruginosa genome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. In
          addition, one of the minor bands exhibited the sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGKPQETFLD</ENAMEX>, which corresponds to the sequence of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein encoded</ENAMEX> by gene PA2531 beginning at residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>.
          Thus, a favored and a minor cleavage site seem to exist
          for the signal peptide. The

          r estimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE staining with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 37,000</NUMEX>. The

          r estimated by gel filtration was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73,000</NUMEX>, indicating the presence of a homodimer.

          centrifugation, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 g</NUMEX> of wet cells were subjected to
          osmotic shock [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. After centrifugation, the
          supernatant was collected and designated as the shocked
          periplasmic fraction. An equal portion of wet cells,
          treated identically but not subjected to osmotic shock,
          was designated as the non-shock periplasmic fraction.
          Crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracts</ENAMEX> were also prepared from each cell-pellet
          fraction.
          The shocked periplasmic fraction contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,100</NUMEX>

          of chorismate mutase activity. As the prephenate

          contamination with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cytoplasmic species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> was less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. The additional assay for shikimate dehydrogenase
          as a marker for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> contamination also showed
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of total activity to be in the shocked

          alkaline phosphatase (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">periplasmic marker</ENAMEX>) was recovered
          in the shocked periplasmic fraction. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-reactivity</ENAMEX> was relatively poor, the presence of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> and its absence in cytoplasmic fractions was

        Discussion
        
          New periplasmic subgroup of AroQ
          When the periplasmic chorismate mutase from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. herbicola</ENAMEX> was initially cloned
          and sequenced, it was a unique case of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> protein
          having a cleavable signal peptide and a carboxy-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">extension.</ENAMEX> The current repertoire of additional AroQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that can be gleaned from the contemporary
          databases on the criterion of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> features numbers
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them has been located in the esophageal
          glands of the phytoparasitic nematode 
          Meloidogyne javanica. Presumably,
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AroQ protein</ENAMEX> is secreted into plant cells as part of
          the parasitic process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The erratic phylogenetic
          distribution of *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> may have a variety of explanations
          that include massive gene loss, horizontal transfer or
          independent evolution of a signal peptide and
          carboxy-terminal extension.
          Figure 2shows a multiple sequence alignment which
          highlights conserved amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX> in the *AroQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> in relationship to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous residues</ENAMEX> that
          have been shown by X-ray crystallography [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] to be
          located in the active site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> domain of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli AroQâ€¢PheA</ENAMEX>. *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> proteins
          are twice the size of the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> catalytic domain.
          The carboxy-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of each *AroQ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is of
          similar length but not highly conserved, and it has no
          known catalytic or regulatory function. When used as a
          query sequence, it returns no significant hits. One
          reasonable speculation is that as *AroQ maybe localized
          at the polar cap(s) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, this region might
          accomplish some sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-membrane interaction that might facilitate its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">spatial</ENAMEX> location at the polar regions of the periplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">milieu</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Substrate specificities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> proteins
          Chorismate mutase catalyzes a facile rearrangement
          reaction that can progress to a significant extent under
          nonenzymatic conditions. The 
          aroQ genes are easily missed during
          genome annotation because they are small and do not show
          strong sequence conservation. We have identified many
          initially dubious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> hits to BLAST queries by alignment
          of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX> known to be critical for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysis</ENAMEX>.
          Figure 3illustrates several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> rearrangements
          that closely parallel the chorismate mutase reaction.
          Zamir 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] have demonstrated the
          isochorismate mutase reaction in higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and Xie 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] presented a rationale
          in support of the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PchB</ENAMEX> from 
          P. aeruginosa catalyzes the
          isochorismate mutase reaction as a step in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salicylate</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-Amino 4-deoxy-chorismate mutase</ENAMEX>
          catalyzes a step in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> (pristinamycin)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
          There is precedent for the finding that within a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grouping</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have differing substrate
          specificities, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> sharing a substrate specificity
          do not necessarily cluster together; for example, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. subtilis AroA</ENAMEX> and close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> are clustered more specifically with KdsA
          sequences than with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli AroA</ENAMEX> and its close
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. The phylogram <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> at the left in Figure
          3illustrates this for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The
          current limitations of homology detection are such that
          the monofunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AroQ proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          Aeropyrum pernix, Enterococcus
          faecalis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helicobacter</ENAMEX> pylori and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanococcus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jannaschii</ENAMEX> cannot be
          shown to be closer to one another or to any other AroQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins/domains</ENAMEX> than they are to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PapB</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PchB</ENAMEX>. This is
          because bootstrap values only support the branching nodes
          to the level shown in bold. Thus, even though the
          computational program used placed 
          A. pernix <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> with the valid
          grouping of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptomyces coelicolor AroQ</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. difficile AroQ</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycobacterium tuberculosis AroQ</ENAMEX>,
          the 
          A. pernix AroQ sequence could in
          fact be closer to any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Thus, one can
          recognize distinct and valid groupings (for example, the
          *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> periplasmic chorismate mutases), but not
          necessarily the exact relationship of these groupings
          with one another.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AroQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of chorismate mutases
          Figure 4shows a phylogram <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of the entire set of
          AroQ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or AroQ domain sequences available from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. A number of cohesive clusters are
          evident. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is the periplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
          monofunctional AroQ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The cytoplasmic
          monofunctional AroQ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-member,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-member, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> isolated so far. AroQ domains that are
          fused with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TyrA</ENAMEX> form a cohesive homology grouping within
          enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and their closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. These same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> also possess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AroQâ€¢PheA bifunctional proteins</ENAMEX>
          whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> domains also form a cohesive homology
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">AroQâ€¢PheA fusions</ENAMEX> are widespread, and the
          sequences of their AroQ domains are highly divergent.
          Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AroQâ€¢PheA proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. aeruginosa/ P. stutzeri</ENAMEX>, from

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maritima</ENAMEX> possess <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AroQ</ENAMEX> domains that cluster with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrap</ENAMEX> values <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50%</NUMEX>. Analysis of
          interdomain linker regions and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage suggests that
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroQ</ENAMEX> and 
          pheA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have fused independently
          on many occasions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.X.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.A.J.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in
          preparation). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AroQâ€¢AroA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fusions</ENAMEX> fall
          into a single cluster supported by a bootstrap value of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX>.
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PchB</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the
          
          P. aeruginosa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has been
          shown to participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salicylate synthesis</ENAMEX> and the
          proposed reaction (catalyzed by isochorismate mutase) has
          been discussed in the previous section. The 
          P. fluorescens <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> undoubtedly
          has the same role. This substrate specificity does not
          necessarily apply to the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. In 
          P. aeruginosa, pchA (isochorismate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX>) and 
          pchB are translationally coupled,
          and 
          cis -expression is obligatory for
          activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. In 
          Vibrio vulnificus, pchB is closely
          linked to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venB</ENAMEX> (isochorismatase) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> cholerae does not exhibit a 
          pchB homolog upstream of the gene
          encoding isochorismatase 
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">vibF</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Perhaps the
          clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PchB proteins</ENAMEX> together reflects their
          interaction with proteins able to bind isochorismate.
        
        
          The periplasmic pathway of phenylalanine
          biosynthesis
          It has been known for some time that
          phenylalanine-pathway redundancy exists in 
          P. aeruginosa. The enzymological
          basis for this became apparent with the recognition of
          the presence of an 'extra' species of chorismate mutase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-F</ENAMEX>) and cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in addition to the
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> -like enzymes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">redundancy</ENAMEX> explained the "reluctant auxotrophy" of 
          P. aeruginosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], as well as the
          "hidden overflow pathway" to phenylalanine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The
          latter phenomenon is one whereby early-pathway regulatory
          mutations that increase intracellular chorismate
          concentrations result in exclusive metabolite flow toward
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine because cyclohexadienyl dehydratase is
          insensitive to allosteric control. In the periplasmic
          system a mixture of flow routes (chorismate â†’ prephenate
          â†’ phenylpyruvate â†’ phenylalanine or chorismate â†’
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prephenate â†’ arogenate â†’ phenylalanine</ENAMEX>) exist because of
          the ability of cyclohexadienyl dehydratase to accept
          either prephenate or arogenate and because of the ability
          of periplasmic aminotransferase (whose detailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterization</ENAMEX> is not within the scope of this paper)
          to transaminate either phenylpyruvate or prephenate.
          The spatial location of the overflow pathway in the
          periplasmic compartment was first indicated by the
          demonstration that cyclohexadienyl dehydratase had a
          cleavable amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> and was translocated to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periplasm</ENAMEX>. Indirect evidence favoring a periplasmic
          location for chorismate mutase as well in 
          P. aeruginosa was the demonstration
          of a periplasmic chorismate mutase in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. herbicola</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The possible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">periplasmic</ENAMEX> location of an aromatic aminotransferase has
          been anticipated, but not directly examined until now.
          This paper demonstrates the identity and presence of all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> enzymes constituting the overflow pathway in a
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
          On the basis of broad comparative enzymological
          surveys [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 29</TIMEX>], a similar intact overflow pathway can
          be anticipated to be present in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serratia</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erwinia</ENAMEX>. The application of queries
          to the finished and unfinished genomes at the National
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biotechnological Information</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] returned
          hits for periplasmic cyclohexadienyl dehydratase and
          periplasmic chorismate mutase in 
          Yersinia pestis. Although no
          aminotransferase gene has yet been found in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pestis that has a predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> peptide, one is present that is predicted by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-Sort</ENAMEX> to be an inner-membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Periplasmic pathway remnants?
          Before the recognition of their periplasmic location,
          it was known [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] that some organisms might have *AroQ
          but not *PheC ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> ) or *PheC but not *AroQ
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klebsiella</ENAMEX> ). It was pointed out
          that appropriate mutants are better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prephenate</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> than in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escherichia</ENAMEX> because of the presence
          of *<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX> in the former but not in the latter. Detailed
          comparative enzymological work in enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 32</TIMEX>] indicates that many additional * 
          aroQ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be identified.
          Within <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Enterocluster-1</ENAMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> typhimurium in lacking *

          *

          Citrobacter ,) lack both
          periplasmic enzymes. On the other hand, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          Enterocluster-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> possess both * 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroQ</ENAMEX> and * 
          pheC, except for 
          Erwinia carotovora which lacks *

          Serratia marcescens, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serratia</ENAMEX> rubidae,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroQ</ENAMEX> and *

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> species of

          a partial pathway is unknown; perhaps *AroQ interfaces
          with a different pathway. In fact, it must be conceded
          that even the function of the intact periplasmic pathway
          to phenylalanine is unknown. An important clue presumably
          is the spatial location at the pole(s) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polar</ENAMEX>, periplasmic location of a number of protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> is receiving increasing attention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Aromatic aminotransferases
          Most aminotransferases that are capable of functioning
          as aromatic aminotransferases are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of family I
          within the aminotransferase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein superfamily</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
          These can usually be assigned to one of three
          subfamilies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subfamily IÎ±</ENAMEX> partitions into
          narrow-specificity aspartate aminotransferases and
          broad-specificity aspartate aminotransferases that can
          accommodate the aromatic ring. Likewise, subfamily IÎ²
          partitions into narrow-specificity imidazole acetol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> (IAP) aminotransferases and broad-specificity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAP</ENAMEX> aminotransferases that utilize aromatic amino/keto
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subfamily IÎ³</ENAMEX> partitions into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> having a
          variety of substrate specificities, with aspartate
          aminotransferases being the most prominent subcluster.
          Among these are broad-specificity aspartate
          aminotransferases with ability to function with aromatic
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
          The periplasmic aminotransferase of 
          P. aeruginosa belongs to the IÎ²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> and exhibits catalytic activity as IAP
          aminotransferase 
          in vitro assayed as described by Gu
          
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. It exhibits signature
          motifs corresponding to the regions of the active-site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysine</ENAMEX> and the interdomain interface [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Like its close
          relative, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HisH</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX>, it has the
          potential to function in both histidine and aromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid biosynthesis</ENAMEX>. Of course, the spatial location
          of *Aat 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ²</ENAMEX> in the periplasm would seem to rule
          out 
          in vivo function in histidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX>. This expectation is accommodated by the
          observation that 
          P. aeruginosa possesses a paralog
          encoded by gene PA4447 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] that must function 
          in vivo as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAP</ENAMEX> aminotransferase as
          it is closely linked with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of histidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX>. Yet another paralog is encoded by gene
          PA3165 and carries out aromatic amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> biosynthesis
          in the cytoplasm. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IÎ²</ENAMEX> paralogs of
          aminotransferase are expressed in 
          P. aeruginosa : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for aromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm, one for histidine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm, and one for phenylalanine
          synthesis in the periplasm. Previous enzymological work
          had demonstrated the existence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> aminotransferases
          in 
          P. aeruginosa that were capable of
          functioning as aromatic aminotransferases 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli transformants</ENAMEX> or

          Enzyme assays
          For routine assays with unpurified protein
          preparations, chorismate mutase and prephenate
          dehydratase were assayed spectrophotometrically by the

          prephenate, respectively. Arogenate dehydratase was
          assayed by measuring the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine
          using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [

          before [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], and phenylalanine and Î±-ketoglutarate were
          used as the substrates, unless indicated otherwise.
          Shikimate dehydrogenase was assayed by monitoring the

          For kinetic determinations made with purified
