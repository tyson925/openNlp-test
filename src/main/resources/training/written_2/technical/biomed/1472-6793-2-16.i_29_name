        The location and numbers of intercostal muscle
        mechanoreceptors suggest that they mediate the transduction
        of chest wall contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Intercostal
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> have been identified histologically [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        These afferents increase their discharge frequency during
        inspiration and decrease their activity during expiration [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle mechanoreceptors enter the spinal
        cord through the thoracic dorsal roots [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . These chest
        wall mechanoreceptors are responsible for segmental and
        intersegmental proprioceptive feedback from the intercostal
        muscles. Intercostal afferents have been shown to alter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inspiratory</ENAMEX> muscle motor activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . The
        activity of respiratory muscle afferents provides essential
        muscle mechanical information during ventilation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        This is supported by previous reports that have shown these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to be sensitive to changes in muscle length and
        stretch velocity and are active during spontaneous
        breathing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 8</NUMEX> ] .
        There have been relatively few studies investigating the
        mechanical transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of intercostal muscle
        mechanoreceptors, with mechanical stimulation confined to
        the tidal breathing range [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hindlimb</ENAMEX> muscle
        preparations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] and similar studies have shown
        that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic types of muscle spindles
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â° and 2Â°</NUMEX> endings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were
        shown to be more responsive to the velocity of stretch and
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Â°</NUMEX> afferents were sensitive to static length changes. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> type of mechanoreceptor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon organ
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTO</ENAMEX>), was also responsive to muscle movement
        (contraction). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Von Euler</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peretti</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] found that all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of mechanoreceptors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTOs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spindles</ENAMEX>) increase their discharge frequency in response to
        changes in muscle length and stretch velocity in the tidal
        breathing range. This is supported by intra-axonal
        recording of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle spindles demonstrating increased
        discharge with inspiration during tidal breathing in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . While it is known that intercostal
        mechanoreceptors are sensitive to muscle motion, the
        specific afferent response to independently controlled
        changes in muscle displacement and velocity over the tidal
        volume range of rib motion is unknown. It was hypothesized
        that intercostal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spindles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTO</ENAMEX>'s transduce muscle length changes with
        increased length associated with increased discharge
        frequency. It was further hypothesized that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> intercostal
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTO</ENAMEX>'s also code muscle velocity changes
        with increased velocity associated with an increase in
        discharge frequency.
      
      
        Results
        Fifty-six intercostal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX> were
        localized. Muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> of these
        mechanoreceptors, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> were identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon
        organs, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mechanoreceptors were not characterized. The
        receptive field locations of these afferents were
        distributed throughout the intercostal muscle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
        receptive fields of the isolated mechanoreceptors were
        discretely localized within a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 - 6</ENAMEX> mm circumferential
        area. The muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were distributed evenly along the
        dorsal-ventral extent of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7th</NUMEX> intercostal space. The
        Golgi tendon organs were located primarily along the caudal
        edge of the fixed cranial rib with a few isolated along the
        cranial edge of the caudal rib.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle spindles
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> were characterized as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX>
        afferents possessed higher conduction velocities (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68.5</NUMEX>
        Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m/sec</ENAMEX>) than 2Â° endings (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43.8</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m/sec</ENAMEX>),
        although there was an overlap between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX> classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon organs had a
        mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">41.9 Â± 8.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/</ENAMEX>sec.
        Muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were studied with and without intact
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ventral</ENAMEX> roots. There was no significant difference in the L
        
        init static discharge frequencies after
        the ventral roots were severed indicating there was no
        appreciable activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">axons</ENAMEX>. Increasing ICS
        displacement resulted in an increased discharge frequency
        in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The L 
        init static discharge frequency for all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 Â± 2 spikes</NUMEX>/sec. The slope of
        static displacement discharge frequency was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.8</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">spikes/sec/mm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The range of static displacement
        discharge frequency for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> afferents was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.8</NUMEX> Â±

        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> Î¼m displacement. The peak instantaneous frequency
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle spindles occurred during the ramp phase of
        displacement. The peak instantaneous frequency also
        increased with increasing velocity of stretch. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spindles</ENAMEX> had a characteristic adaptation of discharge
        frequency at the end of the ramp phase of stretch. The L 
        init static discharge and static hold
        phase discharge frequencies were unaffected by ventral root
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were also found to increase their
        discharge frequency with increasing amplitudes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> space displacement. The L 
        init static discharge frequency of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> was not affected by ventral root
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>. The response of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> to increasing

        The mean L

        Golgi tendon organs increased their discharge frequency
        with increasing displacement amplitudes. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTO</ENAMEX>'s
        had only small increases in frequency with static changes
        in intercostal muscle length. The slope of the curve was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2.7 spikes/sec/mm.</ENAMEX> The mean L

        Discussion
        The results of this study provide a systematic
        description of the mechanosenitivity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Â°</NUMEX>
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon organs. These
        mechanoreceptors have discharge properties that transduce
        the magnitude and velocity of intercostal muscle length
        changes into an afferent code that is transmitted to the
        central nervous system via their spinal dorsal roots. These
        afferents were located throughout the intercostal muscles.
        All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX> studied increased their frequency
        of discharge with increased velocities of intercostal space
        stretch. With the exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon organs,
        all of the mechanoreceptors increased their frequency of
        discharge with increased magnitudes of intercostal space
        displacement. These afferents enter the spinal cord through
        the thoracic dorsal spinal roots and provide essential
        information to the central nervous system on intercostal
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>.
        In the present study, intercostal muscle
        mechanoreceptors were characterized as muscle spindles
        (primary or secondary) or Golgi tendon organs using
        criteria based primarily on physiological response patterns
        (see Methods). It has been shown by others that compared to
        muscles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> hindlimb where spindle classification
        can be based almost entirely on conduction velocity,
        non-limb muscles contain primary and secondary muscle
        spindle afferents that are generally slower conducting and
        exhibit overlapping bimodal or unimodal conduction velocity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectra</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . These studies have shown that only the
        very fastest afferents innervate primary endings (><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>/s) and the negatively adapting discharge frequency during
        static hold and the abrupt decrease in firing at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
        static stretch are the best criteria for characterization
        of primary spindle afferents. In the present study,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle spindles exhibited a bimodal but
        overlapping conduction velocity distribution necessitating
        the use of these physiological criteria.
        The maximal displacement amplitude used in this study
        was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 Î¼m</NUMEX>. This magnitude is approximately equal to the
        change in intercostal muscle length recorded during a tidal
        breath with artificial and spontaneous respiration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 8 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . Mechanoreceptors were recorded from the intercostal
        muscles of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7th</NUMEX> intercos tal space. These are the lower
        parasternal intercostal muscles and increases in their
        length can occur during spontaneous and mechanical
        ventilation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Von Euler</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peretti</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] used a change in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle length of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mm at a velocity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">approximately 1-2 mm/sec</ENAMEX> to study intercostal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX>. The present study used a velocity range
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mm<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/sec - 100 mm/sec</ENAMEX> to span the velocities observed
        in spontaneously breathing and ventilated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The
        responsiveness of intercostal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX> to
        stretch velocities and displacement amplitudes used in the
        present study encompassed the physiologic range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle motion.
        The intercostal muscle spindles localized in this study
        show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â° and 2Â°</NUMEX> afferents could be found with equal
        frequency along the dorsal - ventral extent of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> space. Golgi tendon organs were also evenly
        distributed along the intercostal space at the tendinous
        attachment of the muscle to the rib. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        localized in these experiments were found in the most
        ventral regions of the rib <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with
        the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Von Euler & Peretti</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , who found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to be evenly
        distributed along the dorsal - ventral extent with a slight
        decrease in the numbers of afferents towards the more
        ventral aspects. This decrease in the number of afferents
        ventrally may be related to the fact that all of the
        receptors studied were recorded from the rostral three
        dorsal rootlets supplying the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7th</NUMEX> intercostal space. These
        rootlets were used primarily due to their longer length
        compared to the more caudal rootlets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle
        mechanoreceptors are distributed throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostals</ENAMEX> muscle with afferent nerve fibers distributed
        throughout all the dorsal rootlets. The activity of the
        mechanoreceptors functioning within the more rostral
        rootlets were randomly recorded in the present study and
        should be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> for the discharge properties of
        the afferents throughout the intercostal space.
        The static displacement sensitivity for intercostal
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX> has not been studied previously. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX>
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were found to possess the highest firing
        frequency range with displacements to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</NUMEX> Î¼m. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        recorded muscle spindle response to static displacements in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat soleus</ENAMEX> muscle and found sensitivities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">spikes/sec/mm</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> spindles and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spikes</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sec</ENAMEX>/mm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Â°</NUMEX>

        similar to the sensitivities reported for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> soleus
        muscle but differ from muscles of the digits in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>. These
        differences are probably due to the significant mechanical
        variations in the function of these different muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The intercostal muscle has a unique attachment
        between the ribs that results in an angle of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 60</NUMEX>
        degrees between the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and the rib. A linear
        displacement of the rib <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> will therefore not produce a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> displacement of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. The change in fiber
        length is probably less than the change in space width,
        resulting in an underestimation of the displacement
        sensitivity. This is particularly true for changes in
        tension and the associated discharge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTO</ENAMEX>. The
        experiments described above show that tendon organs are
        responsive to static changes in intercostal muscle length,
        but at a sensitivity lower than that of either the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Â°</NUMEX>
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX>. Increasing the width of the intercostal
        space may change the length of the muscle fibers less than
        space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">width</ENAMEX>, producing smaller changes in muscle tension.
        This would reduce the stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTOs</ENAMEX> and their
        displacement sensitivity would be underestimated. While the
        absolute sensitivity to fiber displacement may be
        underestimated for the mechanoreceptors recorded in this
        study, the above results do provide important
        quantification of the sensitivity of intercostal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX> to changes in the functional displacement
        of the intercostal space.
        The dynamic sensitivities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were found to
        correspond to the ranges of discharge frequencies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">afferents</ENAMEX> characterized by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 9 11</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthews</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">de-efferented 1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle spindles
        in the soleus muscle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> responded to varied
        velocity changes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mm</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX>) in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> -
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 spikes/sec. Discharge</ENAMEX> frequencies found for primary
        muscle spindles in the present study are also similar to
        those for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> afferents in other muscles with intact
        Î³-innervation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 16 17</ENAMEX> ] and without Î³-innervation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . In these studies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were found
        to possess the greatest sensitivity to changes in velocity.
        Our finding of a decrease in the frequency response at the
        highest velocity of stretch used (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼m/msec</ENAMEX>) shows a
        limitation of the primary muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindle</ENAMEX> in coding for
        rapid length changes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthews</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] described a frequency range for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 2Â°
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afferents</ENAMEX> to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 45 - 185 spikes</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> with
        velocity changes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mm</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mm</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> to a final
        length change of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mm in the soleus muscle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>. The
        instantaneous burst frequencies obtained in this study for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Â°</NUMEX> afferents were also similar to those found in other
        studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11 18</ENAMEX> ] . The results obtained by these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> were from hindlimb muscles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> different velocities ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mm</ENAMEX>/sec.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">afferents</ENAMEX> studied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Critchlow & Von</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euler</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] were shown to discharge at rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 - 74</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spikes/sec</ENAMEX> during the inspiratory phase, but were not
        characterized as being either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX>. The
        velocity of intercostal width change was not determined in
        their study. In the present study, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Â°</NUMEX> afferents were
        found to discharge with a slope of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> spikesÂ·sec
        -1/Î¼mÂ·msec <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-1and</TIMEX> were the least sensitive of the three
        types of respiratory mechanoreceptors to dynamic changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle fiber length.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon organs in this study were found to have
        a much greater response to the dynamic phase of intercostal
        muscle stretch compared to the static response. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Von Euler</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">& Peretti</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] reported that a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTOs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle could follow vibrational frequencies
        within the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Â°</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX>. This suggests that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon organs supplying respiratory musculature
        may be more sensitive to changes in muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> than
        those functioning in other muscle groups. Houk &
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henneman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] considered the variable response of GTO
        discharge to tension changes to be due to differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> unit recruitment. These differences, i.e., numbers of
        muscle fibers activated either parallel to or in-series
        with the mechanoreceptor, create changes in the afferent
        receptive field and alter its discharge properties. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passive</ENAMEX>
        length changes caused a linear increase in force acting on
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, the forces acting on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> with active contraction were dependent on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor units</ENAMEX> activated. When the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in-series with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> were activated, there was a linear force
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, resulting in increased impulse
        discharge. However, if the neighboring extrafusal fibers
        were stimulated to contract, they unload the tendon organ,
        thus bringing it to a subthreshold level. Houk &
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henneman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] also found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTOs</ENAMEX> to exhibit a saturation
        effect where by the responses to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> motor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> and that of
        a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> motor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> did not sum algebraically. The primary
        role of this type of intercostal mechanoreceptor is
        hypothesized to be the same as in other muscle groups, i.e.
        the transduction and coding of muscle tension.
        The results of the present study provide a unique
        demonstration of intercostal muscle mechanoreceptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> properties throughout a wide range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle displacement magnitudes and velocities.
        These afferents transduce the intercostal muscle mechanical
        events into a neural code that projects to the central
        nervous system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] via thoracic spinal dorsal roots.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results of this study provide a systematic
        description of the mechanosenitivity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intercostal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX>. These mechanoreceptors
        have discharge properties that transduce the magnitude and
        velocity of intercostal muscle length. These afferents
        transduce the intercostal muscle mechanical events into a
        neural code that projects to the central nervous
        system.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Displacement protocol
          The response to intercostal muscle displacement was
          determined by applying graded amplitudes of stretch to
          the intercostal space. The intercostal space was set at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>
          
          init , the width measured at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FRC</ENAMEX>. The
          displacement amplitudes were applied above L 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">init</ENAMEX> . The amplitudes were: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800</TIMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2000 Î¼m.</ENAMEX> These displacements were presented at a constant
          velocity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼m/msec.</ENAMEX> Each displacement test was
          initiated by activating the displacement motor which
          pulled the caudal rib at a constant velocity to the
          predetermined amplitude. The stretch was then maintained
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 seconds</TIMEX>, after which the displacement motor
          returned the rib to L 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">init</ENAMEX> . There was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> second rest
          period before the next displacement test was initiated.
          The discharge of the afferent was recorded throughout the
          stretch.
          The displacement protocol began with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3</NUMEX>
          displacement stretches of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 Î</NUMEX>¼m to provide a constant
          stretch history in the muscle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICS</ENAMEX> was displaced at
          each amplitude <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times in an ascending order of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplitudes</ENAMEX>. The response of the mechanoreceptors to
          graded displacement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICS</ENAMEX> was determined by
          measuring the frequency of discharge at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          points during the applied stretch. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> measurement
          was taken at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">init</ENAMEX> . This frequency was the baseline
          discharge of the respiratory muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">afferent</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          discharge frequency was determined <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 seconds</TIMEX> after the
          end of the ramp phase (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The discharge frequency
          at this point was termed the static hold phase
          frequency.
        
        
          Velocity protocol
          The response of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMAs</ENAMEX> to dynamic changes in intercostal
          muscle length was determined by varying the stretch
          velocities of the intercostal space. This experimental
          trial followed the displacement test. The intercostal
          space was set at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">init</ENAMEX> and the velocities applied to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">displacements</ENAMEX> above L 
          init The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">velocities</ENAMEX> tested were: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 20, 50</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼m/msec.</ENAMEX> Each velocity
          test was initiated by activating the displacement motor
          to deliver a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> Î¼m displacement at the predetermined
          velocity. The displacement was maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 seconds</TIMEX>
          after the completion of the velocity ramp. The rib was
          then returned to L 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">init</ENAMEX> and the muscle allowed to rest
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 seconds</TIMEX>. The next velocity test was then
          initiated. Each velocity was tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times. The
          discharge of the afferent was recorded throughout the
          stretch. The velocity protocol again began with a series
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> displacement stretches to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> Î¼m to provide a
          constant stretch history.
          The response of the intercostal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">afferents</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graded</ENAMEX> changes in displacement velocity were then
          determined. The discharge frequencies measured were the
          peak instantaneous, static hold phase, and L 
          init static discharge frequencies. The
          peak instantaneous frequency was obtained during the ramp
          stretch of the intercostal muscle and was the maximum
          frequency of discharge. The static L 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">init</ENAMEX> discharge and static hold phase
          frequencies were taken from positions as described in the
          displacement protocol.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Afferents were classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> tendon organs if
          electrical stimulation of the adjacent extrafusal muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> to increase its discharge
          frequency. Those afferents that exhibited a pause in
          discharge frequency as the extrafusal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> contracted
          ("silent period") were classified as muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . Primary muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spindles</ENAMEX> were differentiated from
          secondary muscle spindles with the satisfaction of at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> criteria tested on every afferent:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) a conduction velocity > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m/sec</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) an increase in
          discharge frequency at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼m displacement reflecting a
          low stretch threshold; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) an abrupt decrease in frequency
          discharge at the end of stretch that returned to L 
          init static discharge levels. In
          addition to these criteria, the frequency discharge at
          the end of the dynamic phase of stretch was used as a
          distinguishing characteristic of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1Â°</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Â°</ENAMEX> muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spindles</ENAMEX>. Those spindles that decreased discharge
          frequency gradually to static hold phase levels could be
          identified as primary endings. Secondary afferents
          reached static hold phase discharge frequency at the end
          of ramp stretch and showed little adaptation during the
          static phase. These differentiation criteria have been
          used by others in studies of non-limb muscles where
          conduction velocity of only the very fastest spindle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> can be associated with primary spindle endings [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . The data recorded on magnetic tape was analyzed
          with the aid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spike 2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge Electronics</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design, Ltd.</ENAMEX>) computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX>. The analog signal from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LVDT</ENAMEX> transducer connected to the displacement motor
          provided a measure of length changes and the output was
          sent from the magnetic tape recorder to a digitizing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">processor</ENAMEX> (CED <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1401</TIMEX>). The afferent spikes were
          passed through a slope/height window discriminator
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frederick Haer & Co.</ENAMEX>) and then sent to the signal
          processor as transistor transistor logic (TTL) pulses.
          The digitizing rate of the afferent signal was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hz</ENAMEX>.
          The program was designed to provide the instantaneous
          frequency of the afferent spikes at the corresponding
          amplitudes of the displacement motor that produced the
          muscle stretch.
          The response frequencies used for analysis of the
          displacement coding properties included the baseline or L
          
          init static discharge and the static
          hold phase frequency. The velocity protocol recorded
          these static frequencies in addition to the peak
          frequency obtained during the dynamic phase of stretch.
          The data were grouped by afferent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and graphed
          as means Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Error</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.E.</ENAMEX>) with the dependent
          variable being spike frequency and the independent
          variable being amplitude and/or velocity of muscle
          stretch. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheffe</ENAMEX>'s test for multiple
          comparisons were used to compare the coding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of mechanoreceptors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>
          significance was recorded at p < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
