          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-conformer dataset
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> molecule is a complex diterpenoid with a
          conformationally immobile core consisting of the fused
          A-D rings. Side chains critical for bioactivity of the
          molecule and analogs are those emanating from the core at
          C2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C4 and C13</TIMEX>. To evaluate the energetic performance of
          various computational schemes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taxol</ENAMEX> conformations
          derived from experimental data with differing torsional
          angles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C13</TIMEX> fragment were examined. The diversity
          of C3' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> orientations is illustrated in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, in which the diterpenoid core A<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-C</ENAMEX> rings have been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superimposed</ENAMEX>, and amplified with reference to specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">torsions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> are those with the
          highest estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ΔG</NUMEX> range
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR/NAMFIS</ENAMEX> analysis in CDC1 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> solution. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] Structure 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> corresponds to the non-polar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conformation</ENAMEX> observed as the predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in CDC1 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or CD 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Cl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> as depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          Characteristic of the form is the "hydrophobic collapse"
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] of the benzamido phenyl at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX>' and the benzoyl
          phenyl at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C2</TIMEX>. The point is illustrated by the short <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.4</NUMEX> Å
          distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of the corresponding phenyl
          rings. Conformer 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> experiences a similar collapse with
          a somewhat shorter ring-to-ring distance derived from an
          alternative set of torsions along the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C13</NUMEX> side chain
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). With respect to the close approach between
          pendant hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> resemble the semisynthetic analog
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol, Taxotere</ENAMEX> (docitaxel). The latter compound
          differs constitutionally from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> in that the C10
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> becomes an OH and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHC</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">=O)Ph</ENAMEX> benzamido group
          is replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHC</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">=O)O</ENAMEX>- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t -Bu</ENAMEX>. The single crystal X-ray
          structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2-D</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> (CDCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6d</TIMEX> ] of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxotere</ENAMEX> likewise
          demonstrate hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, in this case between
          the 
          tert -butyl and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C2</NUMEX> phenyl

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 /D</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> It too exhibits hydrophobic
          collapse, but between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> phenyl ring attached
          directly to C3' and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C2</NUMEX>-benzoyl ring (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Isomers 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> are extended rotamers in which the
          C2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">benzoyl</ENAMEX> phenyl ring is distant from both C3' terminal
          rings. Rotamer 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> corresponds to the recently
          proposed bioactive conformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> bound to
          β-tubulin. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] The perspective given as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> ' illustrates the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">T</ENAMEX>" relationship
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phenyl rings of the molecule (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taxol</ENAMEX> conformers included in our
          dataset, 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> , appear together in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cell
          of an X-ray crystal structure determination. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] The
          latter is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> extended structure, while
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophobically</ENAMEX> collapsed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX> is very similar to

        Results
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> conclusions are immediately evident from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tables 2</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 4</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) For a given medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, CHCl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>), there is no consistency in energy
        ranking within the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> methods. MM3(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96</NUMEX>) and
        MM3 (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>), performing similar to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">MM3*</TIMEX>, offer no
        exceptions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-field/ solvation models
        posit non-polar 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to be favored in CHCl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , while <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only MM3*</TIMEX> predicts polar 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to be most stable in the water
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continuum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About half</NUMEX> of the force field

        conformer 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to be lowest in energy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) Use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-31G</ENAMEX>*-quality ESP charges as recommended for the continuum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solvation</ENAMEX> models [ 2b <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] leads to conformer 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , a non-polar type conformer distinct
        from 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, as the uniform global minimum for
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> phase and solution models (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The next
        lowest conformer is predicted to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol higher
        in energy, while overall conformer ranking between the
        different force fields generally inharmonious. Thus,
        incorporation of ESP charges amplifies and alters the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">energy</ENAMEX> rankings. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AM1</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PM3</NUMEX> calculations in the gas
        phase vary in suggesting 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> as most stable (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). While H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> solvation correctly identifies polar
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> , the CHCl 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> also favors either 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> or extended 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> rather than 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> .
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Electrostatic interactions dominate and differ
          across methods
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX>, application of commonly applied force
          fields as well as the semiempirical methods <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AM1</ENAMEX> and PM3
          results in an ordering of conformational energies that is
          method dependent and mostly inconsistent with
          experimental data. In an attempt to understand this
          behavior within the force field framework, we examined
          the various energy contributions for each conformation
          and method. In most cases the overwhelming factor is the
          electrostatic term, a component that is seriously
          amplified by incorporating ESP charges. The point is
          likewise illustrated by damping rather than magnifying
          intramolecular electrostatics. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> polar
          functionalities: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five 3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">atom</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four esters</NUMEX>, one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amide</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five 1- or 2-atom</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OHs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ether,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C9</NUMEX> carbonyl). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of calculations, the latter
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were converted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon analogs</ENAMEX> (CH
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , CH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C=</ENAMEX>CH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , respectively). The optimized
          structures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>) are very similar to those cited in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>, but the individual global minima are
          shifted to different conformers. When the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five C</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">=O</ENAMEX>)-X
          units are converted to trans butene moieties, now
          removing all heteroatoms and most of the electrostatics
          in the molecule, the energy minima shift once again and
          the average energy spread between high and low
          unconstrained energy conformations (i.e. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-5</ENAMEX> ) diminishes to an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kcal/mol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The latter is to be compared with an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol for the fully optimized
          structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>, respectively.
          The molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> results might be ascribed to
          the presence of "low quality" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] parameters in the
          force fields employed. Indeed MM3* and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMFF</ENAMEX> involve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> such interactions out of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">439 and 555</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 and 11%</NUMEX>), respectively. However, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">MM2* and AMBER*</TIMEX>
          incorporate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2 and 6%</NUMEX> such parameters, respectively,
          yet their ability to accurately predict the purported
          experimental forms is not improved. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> semiempirical
          methods each locate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-6</ENAMEX> conformations with energies no
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol above the lowest, but none of the
          calculations selects the same set of low energy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformers</ENAMEX>.
          Modern force fields with stretch, bend, torsional,
          hydrogen bond and cross-terms are parameterized primarily
          within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-bond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">A-B-X</ENAMEX>-Y). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
          key terms, the van der <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waals</ENAMEX> component operates with a
          very short range <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and essentially prevents atom-atom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interpenetration</ENAMEX>. In the absence of damping, the single
          long-range interaction that persists from one end of the
          molecule to the other is the electrostatic contribution.
          While individual bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dipoles</ENAMEX> are characteristic of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allinger MM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of force fields, other molecular
          mechanics methods employ atomic charges. In either case,
          no general scheme for parameterizing the electrostatic
          interaction among multiple polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-space in
          terms of conformational energies has yet emerged.
          Similarly, within a quantum chemical semiempirical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework</ENAMEX>, charge polarization notwithstanding,
          conformational energies are sensitive to method and
          charge distribution. Inspection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4reveals</ENAMEX> that,
          unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>-field results described in Tables 2and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> semiempirical recipes predict polar
          conformers 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to be the low and "global" minimum
          energy forms, respectively, when the aqueous solvation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continuum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is employed. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AM1//</ENAMEX>AM1
          suggests both polar and nonpolar forms 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to be equally populated. This
          limited success is negated, however, by the incorrect
          prediction that the same polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are also the low
          energy forms in the gas phase and in the CHCl 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">solvation model</ENAMEX>. In no instance do
          the semiempirical calculations predict either nonpolar
          forms 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to be dominant in CHCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . As mentioned above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AM1//</ENAMEX>AM1
          calculations posit equal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> for 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> within the latter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, but they
          simultaneously relegate nonpolar 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to a higher energy. The remaining
          semiempirical methods predict the empirically verified
          nonplar conformers 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to be unobservable in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chlorocarbon</ENAMEX> solvent with energies ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol above the polar collapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX>. It
          might be concluded that the water model is robust, while
          the chloroform <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is ill-parameterized, although the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSOL</ENAMEX> literature on solvation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] gives little basis
          for this contention. Alternatively, the few inerrant
          predictions for 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> , combining both structure and
          continuum aqueous solvation energies, might well be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fortuitous</ENAMEX>. The likelihood that this is correct is
          accentuated by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> conformational
          analysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> has never been performed in pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
          but always as a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>-d 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> and D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O. [ 5</ENAMEX> ] In addition, in anhydrous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methanol</ENAMEX>, a solvent with a high dielectric and the
          capacity for explicit hydrogen bonding as in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the
          polar form goes undetected. [ 5b ]
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-Taxol</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly conformation</ENAMEX>)
          For the unsuspecting organic or medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX>,
          however, either interpretation is equally unfortunate.
          Faced with a large, poly-polar organic structure and a
          solvation-equipped semiempirical package, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> is
          limited by the proposition that the aqueous solvation
          model might provide the correct global minimum, but that
          other conformers may or may not be assigned an
          appropriate relative energy. In less polar chlorocarbon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taxol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and other molecules with
          similar complexity do not appear to be capable of even
          qualitative ranking by the various methods with respect
          to energy. An interesting but fortuitous outcome in this
          respect is that conformer 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> conformer of
          Taxol, is predicted to be the dominant conformation by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMFF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AMBER* and MM2</ENAMEX>* under various protocols (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semiempirical</ENAMEX> models likewise predict it to be of low
          energy, though not the most stable (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). This
          conformer was assigned a low population in the
          multi-conformational analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> in chloroform [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          ] , used in the fitting of the electron crystallographic
          density of the β-tubulin/Taxol <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>-stabilized
          sheets, and ultimately assessed as the binding
          conformation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxol</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . A
          unique, but difficulty observed conformer, computational
          methodology overestimates its stability and might have
          led to its discovery by misrepresentation. While the
          operation of serendipity is much to be desired in the
          drug seeking process, errant methodology is the least
          desired path to discovery.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        As a consequence of the above considerations, for highly
        polar molecules like Taxol it is overoptimisitic to expect
        that conformational searching based on a 
        computational energy criterion will
        yield results faithful to experiment. The use of solvent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continuum</ENAMEX> models clearly does not ameliorate the situation.
        Our observations and those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halgren</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] suggest that a
        given force field or quantum chemical method selected for
        potential application to a highly-polar molecular system be
        carefully validated to assure that conformational energy
        comparisons are not spurious. Until this problem can be
        addressed at a fundamental theoretical level, it would seem
        prudent to employ an "energy-free" conformational search
        protocol. We find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAMFIS</ENAMEX> approach valuable in this
        respect; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 19</NUMEX> ] however there are a number of equally
        attractive alternatives [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] that, in principle, can also
        bypass the energy catastrophe. Future work will be devoted
        to examining a range of functionalized organic molecules in
        order to define the boundary of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polarity</ENAMEX> within
        which standard conformational search methodology can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> with confidence.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Force fields and semiempirical methods applied to
          Taxol
          The study was conducted by employing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> popular
          force fields in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MacroModel6.5</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">MM2*, MM3*, AMBER* and</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMFF</ENAMEX>). [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] Each was used in the "gas phase" with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          continuum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">solvation models</ENAMEX> (CHCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX> ] with default MacroModel
          atomic charges (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). To provide a comparison with
          MacroModel, we also tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">solvated MM3</TIMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96</NUMEX>) and
          polarization enhanced MM3(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] In addition, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AMBER*</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> were fitted with MNDO
          electrostatic potential (ESP) charges scaled to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-31G</ENAMEX>* level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] and the calculations repeated
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were also fully optimized with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AM1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM3</ENAMEX> semiempirical methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and
          supplemented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSOL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SM5.4</ENAMEX>a solvation energies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
