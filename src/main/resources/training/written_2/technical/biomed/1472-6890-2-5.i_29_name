        Enumeration of peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (PB) leukemic cells in
        mycosis fungoides (MF)/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sézary syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX>) can be
        difficult by morphological methods. This is due to
        difficulties in unequivocally distinguishing neoplastic
        cells from reactive lymphocytes on standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright-Giemsa-stained PB</ENAMEX> smears. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopic
        evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> is impractical for routine use.
        Therefore, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> have relied on flow cytometric
        evaluation of such specimens.
        Flow cytometric abnormalities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> that have been
        correlated with the presence of tumor cells include
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-positive and/or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD7</NUMEX>-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-cells. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] We have recently shown that increases in
        CD4-positive, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD26</NUMEX>-negative T-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the presence of tumor cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        Another approach to flow cytometric detection of tumor
        cells has been the identification of phenotypically
        aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that express different amounts of cell
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> than normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Such
        stable abnormal expression levels of pan-T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell markers</ENAMEX> is
        a common feature of T cell tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . We sought to
        identify the frequency of such abnormalities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> in PB
        and to determine whether these immunophenotypic aberrancies
        are stable over the course of treatment. We report that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in expression of multiple T cell markers as
        detected by flow cytometry are an easily identifiable and
        stable feature of nearly all cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX>. Such
        immunophenotypic aberrancies can be used to quantify tumor
        cells from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> over the course of the disease.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Patient samples
          We screened all PB smears from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> referred to
          our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1999 and June 2002</TIMEX> who had a
          diagnosis of cutaneous atypical lymphoid infiltrate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX>,
          or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> and a had a full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> flow cytometry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>. Cases
          were considered morphologically positive if they
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 1%</NUMEX> tumor cells by manual differential.
          We also included subsequent involved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PB samples</ENAMEX> from
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> smears were reviewed by a
          single hematopathologist (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX>) to ensure relatively
          uniform criteria in counting of tumor cells. Sézary tumor
          cells were defined as either those with markedly
          convoluted nuclear contours or those that were enlarged
          and had prominent nucleoli. Diagnoses were based on
          criteria outlined in the updated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> classification [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were
          diagnosed to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> involvement occurred
          subsequent to patch/plaque cutaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> lymphoma or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> if the presenting features included an erythrodermic
          rash with >500/μL <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> tumor cells.
          All studies were carried out in accordance with the
          Declaration of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Helsinki</ENAMEX> and followed a laboratory
          protocol approved by our institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Flow cytometry
          We utilized a standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> to analyze
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> PB samples from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-, 3-</ENAMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-color flow cytometric analysis was performed on all
          samples following a standard red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysis method using
          mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> directed against CD45 (clone
          2D1, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">peridin-chlorophyll</ENAMEX>-a-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">PerCP</ENAMEX>]-conjugated,)
          as well as various combinations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD26</TIMEX> (fluorescien
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isothiocyanate</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>]-conjugated), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SK7</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phycoerythrin</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>]), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SK3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4H9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>), CD8
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SK1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> or PE), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD19</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SJ25C1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD26</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L272,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>). In addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S5.2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L17F12</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>),
          and αβ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T10B9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> or PE) were done, in
          a subset of cases. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were from BD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, CA and analysis was performed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACScan</ENAMEX> or FACScaliber cytometers (BD).
          For each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, negative staining levels were set
          by comparison to an isotype-matched control. In a subset
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> cases, cluster analysis using Paint-a-gate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">®software</ENAMEX> (BD) was done to correlate the size of the
          different lymphocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with the phenotypically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aberrant T-cell</ENAMEX> clusters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberrant T</ENAMEX> cell populations
          were defined as discrete immunophenotypic clusters
          (representing a tight cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> or more of analyzed
          events) exhibiting change in levels of expression of
          T-cell antigens relative to an internal
          immunophenotypically normal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or relative
          to expected expression of T cell associated antigens. As
          a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for variations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">T-cell</ENAMEX> markers in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-neoplastic T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, we used the flow
          cytometry results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> or cutaneous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atypical T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infiltrates</ENAMEX> whose PB smears did not show
          identifiable tumor cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> samples from control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without any evidence of malignancy or chronic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The details of these PB cases were previously
          summarized [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . We have previously shown high levels
          of correlation between the presence of an abnormal T-cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> identified by this flow cytometry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> and
          the presence of morphologically identifiable tumor cells
          on examination of the smear [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> test and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank
          correlation test were used to compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          phenotypic aberrancy between different markers.
          Statistical significance was defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">α</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Immunophenotypic aberrancy of common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> markers
          is present in nearly all cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX>
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX>), there was a discrete
          phenotypically abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>(s) identified by flow
          cytometric analysis that correlated with the presence of
          morphologically identifiable tumor cells on PB smear. In
          a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS/MF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with morphologically 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uninvolved PB</ENAMEX> smears, flow
          cytometric analysis identified a phenotypically abnormal
          CD4+ <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> cases. These abnormal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, detected only by flow cytometry, comprised 1
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of total white blood cells and were discrete
          CD4-dim <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD26</NUMEX>-negative T-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Rereview of PB
          smears from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, who had typical cutaneous
          findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX>, did not identify definitive Sezary cells.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD4/CD8</ENAMEX> ratio was elevated (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>4</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> of the
          involved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PB samples</ENAMEX>, at presentation, and in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX> of the
          followup involved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PB samples</ENAMEX> but in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 13%</NUMEX> of the PB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without tumor cells seen on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smear</ENAMEX>. No flow cytometric abnormalities were detected in
          CD4-positive T-cells from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphoproliferative disorders</ENAMEX>.
          The overall incidence of different immunophenotypic
          aberrancies among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is summarized in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. We noted abnormal expression levels of CD3 by
          flow cytometry in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; tumor cells were
          dimmer for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX> than normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          brighter than normal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) and
          completely negative for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Similarly,
          abnormal levels of CD4 expression were seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21 dimmer</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> brighter, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 negative</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B).
          Coexpression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD8</TIMEX> was seen in tumor cells from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, tumor cells showed both
          CD3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aberrancies</ENAMEX>, however the magnitude of these
          changes were not highly correlated when graded as
          negative (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>), dim (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), normal (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) or bright (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> value
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX>).
          In a subset of cases tested, abnormalities in the
          dimmer expression level of CD <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> were seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>) cases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell</ENAMEX> receptor-alpha/beta
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR-α/β</ENAMEX>) expression levels were determined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cases
          and was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> correlated with CD3 expression, in that dim
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR-α/β</ENAMEX> expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cases was associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dim</ENAMEX> CD3
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR-α/β</ENAMEX> was negative in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cases that showed
          absence of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD3</ENAMEX>. CD5 expression was abnormal in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>), of tested cases (dimmer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>, brighter in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          by standard analysis. However, the level of CD5
          expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> was typically variable and careful
          cluster analysis in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> additional cases identified
          discrete CD5-dim tumor cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-cells in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> typically showed a continuous
          variation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD7</TIMEX> expression level. In involved <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MF</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS PB</ENAMEX>
          samples, tumor cells were uniformly negative in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX>) and uniformly positive in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>). In the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD7</TIMEX> expression
          in tumor was variable (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) and was often
          indistinguishable from the range of expression seen in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normal T</ENAMEX>-cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation marker CD26</ENAMEX> was
          uniformly negative in tumor cells from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX>),
          uniformly positive in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and showed variable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positivity</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>. Thus, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 of 44</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD4/CD26</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD3/CD26</ENAMEX> histograms clearly separated the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypically atypical T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Figs.</ENAMEX> 1Cand
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Multiple phenotypically aberrant T-cell populations</ENAMEX>
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX>
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with long standing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX>, we noted 2
          discrete phenotypically abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, these included a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>-dim population
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A); in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-dim and
          CD4-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/3C</ENAMEX>). The remaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> discrete <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> detected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD45</TIMEX> and
          CD5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cases, cluster analysis correlated the
          different phenotypically aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with the
          normal-sized and large transformed neoplastic T-cell
          populations seen on PB smear. This was done by
          pseudocoloring the abnormal cell cluster in the various
          antibody panels and correlating the relative cell size of
          these clusters on the forward/side scatter histograms
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/3C</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Phenotypic aberrancies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> are stable over
          the course of disease
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we analyzed followup PB samples
          that had tumor cells identified on smear and a
          phenotypically abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> identified by flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytometry</ENAMEX>. We examined from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 8</NUMEX> different samples from
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3-year</TIMEX> study period. In a subset
          of cases, we used the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paint</ENAMEX>-a-gate software (on the
          forward-side scatter and other histograms) to quantify
          the size of the aberrant (tumor cell) T-cell population
          in comparison with the other white blood cell types
          detected. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, such a technique could be
          used to document oscillations in tumor cell number that
          occurred over the course of treatment.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, phenotypic aberrancies in the
          levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4 and CD26</TIMEX> were stable with similar
          expression levels detected in all involved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PB samples</ENAMEX>. In
          contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD7</TIMEX> expression varied in the aberrant tumor
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 of 38</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>) cases. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4shows a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-dim phenotypic aberrancy in tumor cells
          that remained constant over the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. In
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, intervening treatments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Targretin</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX>, and photopheresis had no discernible effect
          on overall PB tumor cell number. However, initiation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deoxycoformycin</ENAMEX> (pentostatin) therapy resulted in a
          decrease in the size of the aberrant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD7</NUMEX>-dim tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> (as well as decreases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-cells), consistent with treatment response.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, there were changes in the phenotype of
          tumor cells noted over the study period. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case,
          large cell transformation of tumor cells was associated
          with partial loss of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD3</ENAMEX>. In another case with
          CD4-dim and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-negative tumor cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>,
          effective treatment was associated with selective loss of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>-negative population (data not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We examined the flow cytometry findings in involved PB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, most of who had multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequential</ENAMEX> involved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PB samples</ENAMEX>. Using a standard T-cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytometry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, we noted abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        showing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen aberrancies</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we noted multiple persistent
        phenotypically abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> consistent with
        clonal heterogeneity. We present the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report on the
        stability of such abnormal immunophenotypes in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neoplastic T</ENAMEX> cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS/MF</ENAMEX>, over disease course. Despite
        varying treatments, immunophenotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aberrancies</ENAMEX> noted were
        maintained over the course of disease in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> of cases,
        excluding common variations in the level of CD7 expression.
        These findings support the hypothesis that these abnormal
        T-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> represent the neoplastic clone and
        provide strong support for the use of flow cytometry in
        routine monitoring of treatment response.
        Tumor-associated variation in one or several pan-T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX> is a typical feature of neoplastic lymphocytes in
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-cell</ENAMEX> malignances and has been termed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> "loss"
        or "deletion" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Using immunohistochemistry on a large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bank of T-cell</ENAMEX> lymphomas, we have previously noted a
        frequency of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX> for
        CD3, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD5</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD7</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Flow cytometric
        analysis can allow a more sensitive assessment of subtle
        variations in the levels of surface marker expression than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In non-neoplastic T-cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, we noted relatively narrow range of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, CD4
        and CD5 expression with majority of cells clustering within
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> log intensity. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aberrancies</ENAMEX> noted in
        expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">T-cell</ENAMEX> tumor often showed <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3</ENAMEX> log-fold
        intensity differences from the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Most routinely assessed T-cell diagnostic markers (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR-α/β</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8 and CD45</TIMEX>) are components of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> receptor complex and are dynamically regulated
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T-cell</ENAMEX> maturation and activation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In a
        subset of cases analyzed, we noted that surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD3</ENAMEX> levels
        frequently correlated with levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR-α/β</ENAMEX>, but that CD3
        did not always correlate with variations in the levels of
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX>. We also found variations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> tumor cells
        in the expression level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD45</TIMEX>, a phosphatase that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulates TCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The finding of frequent
        variations in the levels of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>-complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> is intriguing and suggests abnormal regulation or
        formation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in some tumor cells. This
        could be lead to dysregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> signaling effecting
        growth regulation.
        In previous studies, others and we have noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX>
        tumor cells frequently lacked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD26</TIMEX>, and that this finding
        was helpful in identifying the tumor cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 15</NUMEX>
        ] . In this larger longitudinal series, we confirm these
        findings and noted that tumor cells showed a consistent
        pattern of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD26</TIMEX> loss over the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The stable
        loss of expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD26</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">T-cell activation marker</ENAMEX>, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> suggests that this activation pathway may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonfunctional</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> tumors. CD26 is an ectoenzyme,
        which delivers a costimulatory signal in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>; its
        expression is upregulated on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in response to
        mitogenic signals and downregulated through interaction
        with the insulin-like growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor II receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        The consequence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD26</TIMEX> loss is unclear; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD26</ENAMEX> modulates the
        action of many molecules including the chemotactic activity
        of some chemokine important for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> migration to skin [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        In contrast, we noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD7</ENAMEX> expression was frequently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulated</ENAMEX> in tumor cells over the disease course. Several
        previous studies have demonstrated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD7</TIMEX> loss is not a
        predictable marker for detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> cells, as its
        expression is variable in this tumor type [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 19</NUMEX> ] .
        Although there is data to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD7-negative T-</ENAMEX>cells
        may represent a distinct differentiation pathway in normal
        and neoplastic helper T cells, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] the variable
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD7</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> that we have observed suggests
        that this marker may be highly modulated by tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microenvironment</ENAMEX> and/or treatment.
        Identification of a stable tumor-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunophenotype</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> allows tumor cell quantification
        to assess response to therapy. Cluster analysis of abnormal
        flow cytometric immunophenotype is more reliable and easier
        to compare over time than morphologic analysis, and can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detect PB</ENAMEX> involvement in a small number of cases without
        easily identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sezary</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Routine flow
        cytometric profiling is also not as technically demanding
        as molecular monitoring [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron microscopy</ENAMEX>.
        Such a separation of tumor from normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> is also
        important in assessing the effects of therapies on normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukocytes</ENAMEX>.
        In conclusion, we found that the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD26</ENAMEX> and
        other aberrant surface expression of T cell-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> allowed identification of a discrete, quantifiable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MF/SS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> tumor
        cells. Immunophenotypic aberrancies are maintained
        consistently over the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and can be used to
        monitor tumor response to therapy.
