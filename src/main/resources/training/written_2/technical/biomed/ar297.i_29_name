        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX> is an inflammatory rheumatic disease mainly involving
        the axial skeleton. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX> percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> develop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">periphery mono-/oligoarthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SM</ENAMEX> of inflamed peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in
        certain cases resembles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> with intense mononuclear cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infiltration</ENAMEX> forming foci similar to germinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> (GC)
        that contain B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes as well as plasma cells [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. Recent immunohistologic analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX> SMs
        demonstrated B cell rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infiltrates</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases, whereas
        no B cells were detected in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> germline repertoire consists of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">123</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> segments subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        (see supplementary material). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibodies</ENAMEX> are encoded by one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> rearranged to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or several of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> heavy chain
        diversity segments (DHs) and one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JHs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. The locus
        of rearrangement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> for each B lymphocyte clone,
        is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CDR3</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Only rearrangements with translatable
        nucleotide triplets lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> formation, others are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonfunctional</ENAMEX>. There is a biased use of particular germline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> repertoire. An over-representation of
        VH4 genes in the autoimmune repertoire has been described [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>]. A negative selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VH4</ENAMEX> takes place in the
        peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> as a
        means of avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoimmunity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-driven immune response, characterized by a
        ratio of mutations leading to amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> replacement to
        silent mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S ratio) <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] within the
        complementarity determining <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (CDR), takes place
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> of lymphatic organs. Similar clonal
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody VH genes</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SM</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>] and in reactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ReA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. The B cell subset in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joints</ENAMEX> has not yet been characterized. We analyzed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repertoire</ENAMEX> and distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rearranged VH genes</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elucidate</ENAMEX> B lymphocyte involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>, and to
        investigate similarities to and differences from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Tissue preparation and staining
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SM</ENAMEX> of the right hip was obtained from a 57-year-old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, who had suffered from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>, requiring
          total endoprothetic joint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>. Frozen sections (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼m</ENAMEX>) of the immediately snap-frozen tissue sample were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screened for B and T</ENAMEX> cells by double immunohistological
          staining with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD20</NUMEX> and anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> monoclonal
          antibodies using the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatase</ENAMEX> and streptavidin biotin horseradish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peroxidase</ENAMEX> technique [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. The stained B lymphocytes
          from serial sections taken at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50Î¼m</TIMEX> intervals were
          isolated by microdissection, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> preparation followed
          (see supplementary material).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH PCR</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was subjected to a semi-nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> genes
          (see supplementary material). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> cycles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>,
          using a mix of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> oligonucleotides specific for the
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> as primers at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end and a mix
          of oligonucleotides corresponding to the known <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JH</ENAMEX>
          overlapping to a part of the intron sequence as primers
          at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end, were followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼l</NUMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JH</ENAMEX> primers
          (at a more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' position) ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PCR</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was run as a negative control.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Template</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> and sequence analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products of the expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">350</TIMEX> base <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) length
          were detected by standard agarose gel electrophoresis and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX>. The purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX> was bacterially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcloned</ENAMEX> followed by plasmid isolation and sequencing.
          Sequences were analyzed by homology comparison with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBL</ENAMEX> and GenBank gene databases (see supplementary
          material).

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> usage
          Except for the negative control, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH PCRs</ENAMEX> led to a
          product of the expected length (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">350 bp</ENAMEX>). All sequences
          reported in the present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are accessible on the EMBL
          database.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX> individually rearranged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          characterized by sequence analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>): <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>)
          belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VH1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) to
          VH3, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH4</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>) belonged to the VH5
          family. No sequences corresponded to VH6 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in all were nonfunctionally rearranged,
          with the highest proportion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH3</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 14%</NUMEX> in
          VH1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH4 and VH5</TIMEX>, and none in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH2</TIMEX>.
        
        
          VH1 genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> rearrangements represented VH1
          genes. The most often represented VH1 gene was DP75 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">products</ENAMEX>) followed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DP10</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DP14</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DP21 and DP25</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          products each). Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VH1-DH-JH</ENAMEX> sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          were nonfunctional (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>). CDR3 lengths varied between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">39 bp</NUMEX> (mean, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28.5 bp</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VH1</ENAMEX> products (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F5-2c4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F5-3a4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F5-3b4</ENAMEX> and
          5c<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-4m6</ENAMEX>) deriving from different slides had an identically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearranged</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDR3</ENAMEX> and consecutively represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of an
          expanding B lymphocyte clone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). With <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> homology
          to DP21, they shared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mutations within the framework
          region (FR).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">productively rearranged genes</ENAMEX> were highly mutated
          with a range of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">F5-3a3</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> mutations to their
          respective germline (gl) gene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S ratio for the CDR
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>3</NUMEX> and lower for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FR</ENAMEX>, indicating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-driven
          mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        
        
          VH2 genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> different VH2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> were determined.
          All were potentially functional and > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> homologous
          to the respective gl gene. The number of mutations ranged
          from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5c-VH22s</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5c-VH26s</ENAMEX>). R:S ratios were quite
          low, with a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.0</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5c-VH26s</ENAMEX>). CDR3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lengths varied</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 15 and 45 bp</TIMEX> (mean, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 bp</NUMEX>).
        
        
          VH3 genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> different VH3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> were
          characterized: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> were most homologous to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DP47/V3-23</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five to DP50</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> each to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">DP54</NUMEX> and DP31
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>), respectively, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> each to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DP49</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DP35</TIMEX>, DP51
          and DP77 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX>), respectively. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.4%</NUMEX>) VH3 genes were
          nonfunctionally rearranged. CDR3 lengths varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 bp</TIMEX> (mean, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27.2 bp</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> case of clonal expansion within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the VH3</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
          observed, represented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VH3-JH4</ENAMEX> rearrangements
          3a<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-19m6 and 2c-19m8</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b). These genes, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95.5%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DP54</TIMEX>, shared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> replacement mutations, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> mutations each were localized at different
          positions.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VH3</NUMEX> sequences were highly mutated
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-27</NUMEX> mutations). Except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, most of the
          mutations were localized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S ratio ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> nonfunctionally rearranged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> also
          revealed a pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced mutation.
        
        
          VH4 genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> different VH4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> could be
          characterized; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> were potentially functional. CDR3
          lengths ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 to 45 bp</TIMEX> (mean, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 bp</NUMEX>).
          The gl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes HUMIGHCAK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUMIGHCAG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP63</ENAMEX> were
          represented twice each, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DP71</ENAMEX> once. No homology to
          DP64<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/VH4-34/VH4.21</ENAMEX> was seen. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> had
          few mutations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>) with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S ratio higher in
          the FR than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> VH4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ratio >3</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5c-VH44a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3b-VH45a</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          VH5 genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> distinct VH5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> could be determined;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> were potentially functional. CDR3 lengths ranged
          from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 to 66 bp</TIMEX> (mean, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">39.8 bp</NUMEX>).
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3a</NUMEX>-VH54s gene was unmutated. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7-35</NUMEX>
          mutations in all other sequences. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sequences
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> were potentially functional), the mutational
          pattern revealed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen induction</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH PCR</ENAMEX>
          Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rearranged VH genes</ENAMEX> from B lymphocyte DNA
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and sequencing enabled characterization of the
          clonal expansion and mutational patterns without bias due
          to cell isolation procedures. By semi-nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>,
          otherwise used for single-cell analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], one sole
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DH-JH</ENAMEX> rearrangement might be identified. Besides the
          extreme sensitivity, there is a high risk of artificial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplifications</ENAMEX> because of contamination. A negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was run with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> as a
          precaution: no contamination was detected. We cannot
          exclude the fact that highly mutated genes are amplified
          less efficiently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. However, since the respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ReA</ENAMEX> have been established by
          similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PCR</ENAMEX> approaches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>], a
          comparison is possible.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> usage
          Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DH-JH</ENAMEX> rearrangements characterized in
          this study, all known human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VH6</ENAMEX> were
          represented. The descending order of representation was:
          VH3 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH5</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH4</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>).
          Compared with the germline representation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], an
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VH5</ENAMEX> and an under-representation of
          VH4 genes were remarkable. The representation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH1</TIMEX>, VH2
          and VH3 genes corresponded to their respective germline
          representation. Our previous studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX> gene
          repertoire in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] and studies using a hybridoma
          approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] revealed an over-representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VH4</ENAMEX> and
          a biased set of represented VH4 genes. A positive
          selection of VH4 genes, particularly within the plasma
          cell subset, was recently demonstrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ReA</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP64/VH4-34/VH4.21</ENAMEX> gene encoding anti-I and
          anti-i specificity of cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agglutinins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>], as well
          as anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA antibodies</ENAMEX> in lupus erythmatosus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], was
          not detected within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the VH4</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS SM</ENAMEX>.
          Another autoimmunity-prone gene, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP47/V3-23</ENAMEX> gene,
          was also predominant in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>. All of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> V3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-derived
          genes were potentially functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> with
          ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> mutations to the gl sequence, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> reveal a
          R:S ratio <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>3</NUMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX> that indicates a selection
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. V3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> was also predominant in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. A
          comparison of the peripheral repertoire revealed that
          V3-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> was more often somatically mutated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> than in
          healthy controls [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 25, 26</ENAMEX>].
          Except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH5 and VH6</TIMEX>, the representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX>
          genes was similar to results from the peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH</ENAMEX>
          repertoire from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthy donors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 9</TIMEX>] as well as from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Clonal expansion
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> cases of clonal expansion characterized by
          identically rearranged segments were detected on
          different slides. An accumulation of further point
          mutations in the course of intraclonal diversification
          was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VH3</NUMEX> clone (both share <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> and differ in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> point mutations). Studies on
          plasma cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ReA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SMs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] reveal clonal
          expansion. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SMs</ENAMEX>, clonal B lymphocyte expansion in
          different areas of the tissue samples [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 15</TIMEX>] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recirculation</ENAMEX> within different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> were
          reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        
        
          The CDR3
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CDR3</NUMEX> lengths of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          short, with a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.2</NUMEX> nucleotides. A high
          variability, particularly in the productively rearranged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subset</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VH5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, was noted. A similarly high
          variability was shown for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyreactive antibodies</ENAMEX> and
          rheumatic factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Our data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> SM
          revealed almost homogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDR3</ENAMEX> lengths of intermediate
          size [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. CDR3 were much longer in the healthy
          peripheral repertoire, particularly within nonfunctional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> (mean, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> nucleotides) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          Mutational pattern
          Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rearrangements</ENAMEX> were not mutated. R:S ratios
          ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX> were observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonfunctional</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the VH1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH3</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VH4</ENAMEX> and VH5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> carried more somatic mutations than the VH2
          genes.
          Mutational pattern and frequency determine about one
          half of the characterized genes as memory B cells that
          probably stay in contact with persistent antigens in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>-environment of the synovial foci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. A similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of memory cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA SM</ENAMEX> has been reported [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 31</TIMEX>].
          Besides the highly mutated genes already described,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> of the characterized genes showed no evidence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced mutations with low <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>:S ratios within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDR</ENAMEX>. There was a bias to silent mutations in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> highly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutated genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2c-3m4b</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2c-21m3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3a-19m8</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2c-17m9</ENAMEX>).
          This pattern of mutations has been described for cold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agglutinins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], as well as for rheumatic factors, as a
          mechanism of selection against amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> replacement to
          prevent the generation of high-affinity autoantibodies [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Nonfunctional rearrangements
          Except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH2</TIMEX> (none) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH3</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>), nonfunctional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> had an equal proportion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13-14%</NUMEX> in each
          family within the genes characterized in the present
          paper. Except for a bias to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">VH4</TIMEX>, a similar overall
          proportion of nonfunctional rearrangements was seen in
          the peripheral blood of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthy donors</ENAMEX> using single-cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. In contrast, no bias to elevated
          CDR3 lengths was seen.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        An active immune reaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GC</ENAMEX> formation occurs in
        the inflamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SM</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AS</ENAMEX>. B cell affinity maturation with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">somatically mutated antibody</ENAMEX>-coding genes
        characteristic for memory cells occurs in these GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formations</ENAMEX>, indicating an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-driven response.
        Comparable with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ReA</ENAMEX>, there is a biased repertoire of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selected VH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of represented genes
        is different and clonal expansion was observed less
        frequently.
