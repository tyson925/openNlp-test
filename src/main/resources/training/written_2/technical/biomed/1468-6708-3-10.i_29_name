        Prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heart Attack Trial</ENAMEX> (ALLHAT) is a randomized,
        two-component clinical trial sponsored by the National
        Heart, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blood Institute</ENAMEX> (NHLBI). A double-blind,
        active-controlled hypertension component is designed to
        compare the rate of fatal coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX> (CHD) or
        nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (the primary endpoint)
        in high-risk hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 55 years</TIMEX> or
        older, between those randomized to treatment initiated with
        a diuretic (chlorthalidone) and treatment initiated with
        each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antihypertensive drugs</ENAMEX>: a
        calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine), an
        angiotensin-converting enzyme (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX>)-inhibitor (lisinopril),
        or an alpha-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX> (doxazosin). An open-label
        lipid-lowering component is designed to determine if
        lowering LDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> with pravastatin compared to
        "usual care" reduces all-cause mortality in a subset of
        moderately hypercholesterolemic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Randomization</ENAMEX> to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> component began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February, 1994</TIMEX>, and
        continued through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January, 1998</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,418</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        recruited at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">623</NUMEX> clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>.
        Randomization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,355</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> into the lipid trial
        ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 31, 1998</TIMEX>. Follow-up on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> continued
        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March, 2002</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Following independent reviews by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monitoring Board</ENAMEX> (DSMB) on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 6, 2000</TIMEX>, and by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoc Committee</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 21, 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blood Institute</ENAMEX> accepted a
        recommendation to discontinue the doxazosin treatment arm
        of the antihypertensive trial. This recommendation was
        based on the low probability of doxazosin showing benefit
        over chlorthalidone for the primary endpoint, as well as
        the significantly increased occurrence of the secondary
        endpoint, combined cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (CVD)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">encompassing CHD</ENAMEX> deaths, nonfatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revascularization</ENAMEX> procedures [coronary artery bypass graft

        [in-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revascularization</ENAMEX>]) in the
        doxazosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RR 1.25</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.17</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.33</NUMEX>; 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>), with a doubling of risk
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> (fatal, hospitalized and treated but nonhospitalized)
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RR 2.04</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.79</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.32</NUMEX>; 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>). When only fatal and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospitalized HF</ENAMEX> were analyzed, the large difference
        remained (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RR 1.83</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.58</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.13</NUMEX>; 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>). The findings and
        operational aspects of stopping the doxazosin arm of the
        study have been previously described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        The observed increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> in the doxazosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as
        compared to the chlorthalidone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> led to several
        additional analyses aimed toward validation of the
        diagnoses, with a focus on hospitalized and fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>. The
        purposes of these analyses were: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to evaluate the reality
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> cases, i.e. whether diagnosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and
        clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> were what might be expected, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) to
        compare these features between the two treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design</ENAMEX>
          The rationale and design of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> are described in
          detail elsewhere [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Briefly, those eligible for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomization</ENAMEX> had systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> and/or diastolic blood pressure of at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, or took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and
          had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> other risk factor for CHD events. Risk
          factors included previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, left ventricular
          hypertrophy by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram,
          history of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, current cigarette smoking,
          and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level.
          The primary endpoint of the blood pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX>) trial
          is the composite of nonfatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> and fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          protocol-defined secondary clinical outcomes are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-cause mortality, combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> death,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonfatal MI</ENAMEX>, coronary revascularization procedures and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hospitalized angina</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, and combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> (including
          CHD death, nonfatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, coronary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revascularization</ENAMEX> procedures, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> treated in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> or as an outpatient, lower extremity peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arterial disease</ENAMEX> treated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or with
          outpatient revascularization, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>, fatal or treated in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or as an outpatient).
          The validation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HF</ENAMEX> diagnosis entailed answering
          several questions:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Did HF cases meet ALLHAT diagnostic criteria?
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Were baseline characteristics and medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> for HF cases as expected and similar across
          the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>?
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Were prevalence and severity of systolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> as expected and similar across drug
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>?
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Were case-fatality rates as expected and similar
          across drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>?
          Unless otherwise specified, all data for these
          analyses were collected as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart Failure Diagnosis</ENAMEX>
          At each follow-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> visit the occurrence of study
          clinical events was assessed, and, if identified by the
          clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>, reported on an endpoint form. For
          each event involving hospitalization, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          discharge summary or expiration summary was to be
          submitted, and for each death a death certificate was
          required. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endpoint</ENAMEX> forms and supporting documentation
          were reviewed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ALLHAT Clinical Trials Center</ENAMEX> (CTC)
          for accuracy and appropriateness. When a discrepancy or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambiguity</ENAMEX> was found, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX> sent a written query to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Principal Investigator</ENAMEX>, who retained the final word
          concerning the diagnosis or cause of death. A random <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
          sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonfatal MIs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX> deaths was
          selected for blinded quality control evaluation by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT Endpoints Subcommittee</ENAMEX>; for these cases additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> was requested.
          No such routine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endpoints Subcommittee</ENAMEX> quality control
          was initially planned for reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>. However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee</ENAMEX> was subsequently called upon to evaluate a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> sample of reported fatal and hospitalized nonfatal
          HF events. As this occurred prior to the termination of
          the doxazosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, neither the chair nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee</ENAMEX> was informed of the major reason for
          this review, namely, the trend toward a higher HF event
          rate in the doxazosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlorthalidone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee</ENAMEX> was told that the
          review was undertaken at the request of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSMB</ENAMEX> to
          address the reliability and validity of reported HF
          events. This evaluation consisted of fifty events, evenly
          distributed across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, reported as
          fatal or hospitalized nonfatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> and with
          protocol-required documentation (discharge summary for
          hospitalized events, death certificates for deaths).
          Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> was not requested, since this would
          have posed an undue burden on the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> staff and
          would have risked raising questions about emerging
          differences among treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>, used previously in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systolic Hypertension</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elderly</ENAMEX> Program (SHEP) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
          , includes "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with clear-cut signs or symptoms of
          left or right ventricular dysfunction that cannot be
          attributed to other causes..." The diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> must
          include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stated symptoms [paroxysmal

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distention</ENAMEX>). Since lower extremity edema or exertional
          dyspnea may be due to non-cardiac causes, the presence of
          either of these alone, without other indications of heart
          failure, is not sufficient for a diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>. Study
          guidelines caution against a hasty <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HF</ENAMEX> diagnosis in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, including chronic
          obstructive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary disease</ENAMEX> (COPD), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>, or other
          severe, documented lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.

          Baseline characteristics of chlorthalidone and

          treatments for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] , was compared between

          Baseline characteristics of doxazosin and
          chlorthalidone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with subsequent hospitalized

        Discussion
        The finding of significantly increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> events in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doxazosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared with the chlorthalidone group
        created a dilemma for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX>. Since the trial was not
        designed to focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>, a component of a secondary
        endpoint, the validity of reported HF events became an
        issue. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we have described several analyses to
        address this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
        As previously reported, lost-to-follow-up and event
        documentation were similar in the two treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        ] . Steps employed to validate the HF outcome in these
        treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> confirmed the consistency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> event
        reporting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had similar
        baseline characteristics when stratified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> status. The
        differences in eligibility risk factors between those
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> and those without is not surprising:
        larger percentages of those with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> had a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CABG</ENAMEX>, angioplasty, other atherosclerotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> (ASCVD), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, low HDL levels
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> abnormalities. Nonetheless, these eligibility
        factors were not substantially different between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlorthalidone</ENAMEX> and doxazosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>.
        Post-diagnosis pharmacologic management of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> measure of the strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' confidence in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> diagnoses. Open-label diuretics, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE-inhibitors</ENAMEX> and
        beta-blockers, all recognized treatments for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>, were
        prescribed similarly for the chlorthalidone and doxazosin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, suggesting similar assessment of these events in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> were equivalently met in the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. While the sample (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>) of hospitalized or fatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> reports reviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT Endpoints Subcommittee</ENAMEX>
        was limited in number and in adequacy of corroborating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX>, the review nonetheless showed adherence to
        study criteria for the majority (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>) of the event reports.
        The sometimes-discrepant results between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>
        pertained more often to incomplete data than to rejection
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HF</ENAMEX> diagnosis.
        Clinical use of more objective measures, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noninvasive</ENAMEX> and/or invasive tools for the measurement of
        left ventricular function, offers a means of establishing
        and quantifying systolic failure in cases clinically
        suggestive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 10</ENAMEX> ] . Among the ejection fractions
        reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> events that were reviewed, the
        majority fell at or below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>, indicating some degree of
        systolic dysfunction. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> is a clinical diagnosis
        that does not necessarily exclude those with intact left
        ventricular systolic function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypertension</ENAMEX> is a
        major risk factor for diastolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 25%</NUMEX> of
        asymptomatic hypertensives with left ventricular
        hypertrophy have diastolic dysfunction. Additionally, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with coronary artery disease may have some
        degree of diastolic dysfunction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold increased relative risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doxazosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared to the chlorthalidone group
        changed little when confined to hospitalized and fatal
        events. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in both the doxazosin and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chlorthalidone</ENAMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> showed a rather high <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
        case-fatality rate over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, as expected in HF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13 14</NUMEX> ] , further supporting the validity of
        the diagnoses in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        hospitalized for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> who subsequently died, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of the
        deaths in each drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were attributed to cardiovascular
        causes.
        Treatment group differences in mortality attributed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> may take time to be recognized. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> are at
        risk for other competing causes of death. Accordingly, it
        may be too early to determine if a higher rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doxazosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> translates into a higher overall mortality
        rate. A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year</TIMEX> case-fatality rate with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> difference
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> incidence rate translates into a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8%</NUMEX> potential
        difference in total mortality without any competing causes
        of death. With competing causes, the difference would be
        smaller and difficult to detect even in a trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX>'s
        size.
        The diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> is generally made on the basis of
        signs and symptoms that may overlap with those of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiovascular</ENAMEX> and pulmonary pathologies. Moreover, the
        clinical picture may be further complicated for patients
        taking doxazosin, side effects of which (edema, dyspnea,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] may be misinterpreted as
        manifestations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX>.
        The capture of events in a "large and simple trial" such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> has potential limitations. Built into a structure
        composed largely of community-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> is the
        assumption that their characterization of clinical events
        reflects diagnostic standards of the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
        and, as such, meets study criteria. However, with its large
        number of endpoints, resources available to ALLHAT
        precluded more than modest confirmatory event
        documentation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources</ENAMEX> were allocated for additional
        documentation for quality control validation only for a
        sample of the primary endpoint (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIs</ENAMEX> and fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHD</ENAMEX>) and for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX>. While all reported events are reviewed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX>,
        the sometimes incomplete supporting details in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> may not allow for validation of all events
        according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> criteria. Some discharge summaries and
        death certificates may lack sufficient descriptive
        information needed to confirm the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">diagnoses</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> are unable to provide corroborating
        documentation for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> event reports.
        Efforts to authenticate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HF</ENAMEX> events in the doxazosin
        and chlorthalidone treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> represented a desirable
        step in the examination of the increased rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doxazosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. All methods employed provided confirmatory
        evidence that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HF</ENAMEX> diagnosis and the difference in
        HF rates noted between the doxazosin and chlorthalidone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were valid. Results of this exploratory
        investigation support the event ascertainment methods
        developed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX>, specifically for HF events. This
        validation exercise further illustrates the ability of
        large, simple trials to answer important public health
        questions requiring large sample sizes and to grapple with
        unexpected results in a responsible and meaningful
        manner.
