        The expression "first pass metabolism" (FPM) refers to
        the metabolism that an ingested <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound undergoes</ENAMEX> in its
        passage through the gut and liver before reaching the
        systemic circulation. It is a useful concept for a drug
        because it provides information about the relative
        therapeutic effect of an orally administered drug relative
        to its intravenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>). The standard
        approach to quantitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> is to compare the area under the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curve</ENAMEX> (AUC) for equal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and oral doses. The fractional FPM
        is then defined as the fractional difference in these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>:
        
        The mathematical basis of this definition is based on
        the following arguments: Given some time dependent input to
        the systemic compartment (I(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)), and some removal rate from
        the systemic compartment (Q(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)), the integral over all time
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two</TIMEX> rates must be equal:
        
        If the removal rate has a linear dependence on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (Q(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>) = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KC</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>)) then this total input can be
        related to the AUC:
        
        Since the total input to the systemic compartment is
        proportional to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), the fractional difference
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> for an oral and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">eq 1</ENAMEX>) is a measure of
        the amount of the oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that never reached the systemic
        compartment because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>.
        This standard operational definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> (eq. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is
        crucially dependent on the assumption that the removal rate
        is linear. If this assumption is invalid, then use of this
        definition can return very misleading results. A recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> has described the confusion that has resulted from
        applying this definition to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX>,
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> that has extremely non-linear liver metabolism [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ] .
        For the non-linear case, the intuitive idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> is
        equal to the fraction of the absorbed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that is
        metabolized in its first pass through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> is no
        longer valid [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Consider the case where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> absorption
        is occurring at a time when the systemic drug concentration
        is so high that the liver metabolism is completely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">saturated</ENAMEX> and the metabolic rate is constant, independent
        of concentration. Clearly, at this time, the rate of drug
        metabolism for an oral input must be identical to that for
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, even though a large
        fraction of the absorbed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> may be metabolized in its
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. This metabolized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> component
        is simply displacing systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that would otherwise
        have been metabolized.
        In order to avoid these problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] introduced a new definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>, based on
        estimating the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peripheral Availability"</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> is defined as the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> that
        reaches the systemic circulation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentry et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        estimated the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> by assuming that the tail of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol venous</ENAMEX> concentration curve can be approximated
        by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> compartment model in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>) was defined by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michaelis-Menten</ENAMEX> function
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M = VmC/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Km+C</ENAMEX>)). The values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vm and Km</ENAMEX> are found by
        curve fitting, and then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> is defined as the integral of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
        from time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to a long time when no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> is present.
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> is defined as the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> that was
        metabolized from the systemic circulation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> is then
        defined as the difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> infusion
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> for the oral intake of an identical dose. This
        one compartment definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> has become the standard
        definition in some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        This definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM of Gentry et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] is
        inaccurate because it is a poor approximation to treat
        ethanol metabolism as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> compartment system (see below).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levitt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levitt</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] described an approach to estimate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> compartment model. They distinguished the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver ethanol</ENAMEX> that came directly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> tract from the
        recirculating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, and derived an accurate
        approximation for this recirculating component. This 2
        compartment approach provides a significantly more accurate
        (and smaller) estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> than the one compartment
        model.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">compartment model</ENAMEX> still makes some simplifying
        assumptions. These assumptions are eliminated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] , a new, general-purpose physiologically based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetic</ENAMEX> (PBPK) software routine. The approach used
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input data to find the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, and then, using these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parameters</ENAMEX>, solve for the time dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input function
        that would produce a blood time course identical to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course observed with the orally administered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input function is a direct measure of the rate that
        the oral dose reaches the systemic circulation, i.e. the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PA. Using</ENAMEX> as input just the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters and the blood
        ethanol levels produced by an oral dose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> outputs
        (in both tabular and graphical form) the time course of the
        intestinal absorption and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] for the
        mathematical and computational details).
        The difficulty in defining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> has
        created a controversy over the question of the magnitude of
        ethanol metabolism that occurs in the stomach before
        reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . It has been observed that the
        "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FPM</ENAMEX>" is significantly reduced when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> is infused
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraduodenally</ENAMEX> compared to the standard oral
        administration and this difference has been interpreted as
        representing gastric mucosal metabolism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Clearly, if there are errors in the measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> then
        this estimate of gastric metabolism may be spurious. In
        addition to providing a value for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also
        provides a direct measurement of the rate and amount of the
        orally administered solute that reaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. In this
        paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> will be applied to investigations of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX>, providing information about the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>; the time course of intestinal absorption, and the
        total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. This is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first human PBPK</ENAMEX> model for ethanol incorporating intestinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pistino</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conolly</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] have
        previously developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> PBPK that quantitated ethanol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>.

        Methods
        
          PBPK program and its assumptions
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] was used for all the analysis in this
          paper. All the figures shown in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are direct
          copies (in jpeg format) of standard PKQuest output.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> makes several simplifying assumptions (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
          for details). It is assumed that each organ can be
          modeled as a single well-stirred compartment. In
          addition, for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">solutes</ENAMEX> investigated in this paper
          (D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>) it is also assumed
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is flow limited so that
          the unbound water concentration in the tissue is equal to
          that in the vein leaving the tissue. This is clearly an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX> and effects such as diffusion gradients,
          countercurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> and heterogeneous organ blood
          flows [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] will produce small deviations from
          this assumption.
        
        
          Standard human parameters
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters used here are identical to those
          used in all the other applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 13 14</ENAMEX> ]
          . The procedures used for choosing and refining these

          and to the organs drained by the portal vein (stomach,

          refers to the inert component of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, cartilage etc. in
          which it is assumed there is no solute distribution or
          blood flow; and "other" are all the other organs with a
          flow and weight adjusted to account for the total body
          weight (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 Kg</NUMEX>) and the total default cardiac output (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.06</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min</ENAMEX>). These organ weights are for the default
          value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> body fat. They are scaled depending on the

          Experimental data
          The D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O</ENAMEX> data was obtained from the
          measurements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schloerb et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] of the
          arterial serum concentration after a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 second</NUMEX> bolus
          injection. The results are for one experiment on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> male
          subject (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.O.</ENAMEX>, total body water of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48.0</NUMEX> liters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] ). The amount of D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> injected was back calculated from
          the total body water and the concentration after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> when the D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> had equilibrated.
          A baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PBPK</ENAMEX> model was developed based on
          the careful and detailed measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] of the simultaneous breath and venous blood
          concentrations for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minute</TIMEX> constant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> ethanol
          infusion. The concentration calculated from the breath
          measurements was in good agreement with the direct venous
          measurements. The breath results were used here since
          they should be closer to the ideal of an arterial sample
          then the venous measurements from the cubital vein. The
          total body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for each subject in this study was
          directly measured using D

          modeled using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. The data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiPadova et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          was used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the rate of absorption
          of oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, along with calculations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> was applied to the data plotted in figures
          1and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3of DiPadova et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] which describe the mean

          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> was then adjusted so that the model total body
          water equaled this measured value. Since, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is the
          "standardhuman", all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameter are input simply
          by calls to the "defaultpar()" and "standardhuman()"
          procedures. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> are in terms of liters,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kg</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. The parameter "cunit" is the amount unit
          (concentration = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cunit/liter</ENAMEX>). Since the D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> concentration was expressed in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">vol%</NUMEX>, this corresponds to a cunit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml. The only
          other information that is needed is concunit [artery] =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, which indicates that the input data is the arterial
          free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> concentration. The observed equilibrium
          concentration was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.144 vol%</NUMEX> which corresponds to a total
          D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69.05</NUMEX> ml, or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">276 ml/min</ENAMEX>
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.25 minutes</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.6</NUMEX> units/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ml.
          The output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> for this data is shown in fig.
          1A(all of the figures in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are taken unmodified
          from the standard output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>). The value for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">resting</ENAMEX> muscle blood flow (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.0266 Lit/min/Kg</ENAMEX>) was
          determined by adjusting the flow to optimize the fit to
          the data using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX> minimization procedure of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. The agreement between the PBPK prediction (solid
          line) and the experimental measurements (squares) is very
          good.
          This agreement is sensitive to the value used for the
          muscle blood flow. For example, fig. 1Bshows the effect
          of doubling the total muscle blood flow from this
          default, best fit, value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0266</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0532</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">liters/min/kg</ENAMEX> (increasing the cardiac output from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.06</NUMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6.93 liters/min</ENAMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Kg man</ENAMEX>). Muscle blood flow can
          vary many fold and one would expect that it would depend
          on the specific experimental conditions, such as whether
          the subject was supine or ambulatory. In any case, muscle
          blood flow is routinely varied when fitting data with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. This variation may have some physiological
          significance and/or it may be just a "fudge factor".
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Ethanol PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters
          The recent measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] of
          the time course of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol blood</ENAMEX> levels after an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input
          were used to determine the standard ethanol PBPK
          parameters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> was used to model the time course of
          the mean blood values of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>). This data was expressed as the concentration in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in units of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">millimoles</ENAMEX>/liter of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood water</ENAMEX>.
          Both breath and direct venous sampling results were
          reported and they were in very good agreement. The
          results shown in fig. 2use the breath measurements since
          they should be closer to the ideal of an arterial sample
          then the venous measurements from the cubital vein. The

          The value for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fat</ENAMEX> (fraction of body weight that is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fat</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.24</NUMEX> was chosen so that the model subject had a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX> volume equal to the average D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> volume of distribution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>). The muscle blood flow was the same as the
          (default) value that was used in fig. 1Afor the D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 O</ENAMEX> data. Since liver metabolism
          accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 95%</NUMEX> of ethanol removal, it is
          assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> is the only site of ethanol
          elimination [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver metabolic constants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vm</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millimoles</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">min for 80 Kg man, Km</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX> mM) were
          adjusted using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX> minimization procedure of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to give the best fit to the data. These values
          refer to the free water concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> (see [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] for details). There are a number of isoenzymes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol dehyrogrenase</ENAMEX> (ADH) in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">model Km</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX> mM is consistent with the in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.048 mM</NUMEX> observed for one of these isoenzyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . It
          is assumed that ethanol distributes in the total body
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, which is the default in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. The parameter fw
          [lipid] = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/0.074</NUMEX> represents the inverse of the oil/water
          partition coefficient and indicates that the equilibrium
          ethanol concentration in the body fat is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.4%</NUMEX> of the
          concentration in body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> dose was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">0.4 gm/Kg</ENAMEX>, given as a constant <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minute</TIMEX> infusion,
          corresponding to an infusion rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millimoles</ENAMEX>/min
          for an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">80 Kg human</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple</ENAMEX> procedure
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol_norberg</ENAMEX>) completely specifies the PBPK
          parameters. All the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> parameters are set by the
          calls to defaultpar() and standardhuman(). Figure 2shows
          the output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> for this input. Again, the
          agreement between the PBPK prediction for the arterial
          blood concentration (solid line) and the observed breath
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (squares) is quite good.
        
        
          Quantitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> first pass metabolism
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiPadova et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] measured the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood ethanol</ENAMEX> in
          subjects that were given the same dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minute</TIMEX> constant infusion) or orally (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>), on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the venous
          concentrations as a function of time when a low dose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethanol</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/Kg</ENAMEX>, equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12</NUMEX> oz of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beer</ENAMEX>) was given at the same time as a standard breakfast
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> (black) or orally (red). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> under the
          oral dose curve is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 27%</NUMEX> of that for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> dose. This
          would correspond to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> if metabolism was linear
          - i.e. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 27%</NUMEX> of the orally ingested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> reaches
          the systemic circulation.. As will be shown below, the
          actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> is much less than this.
          The data in fig. 3was analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. Figure
          4Ashows the agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and the
          venous plasma ethanol concentration for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters used in this calculation were
          identical to those used for figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2except</TIMEX> that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">portal</ENAMEX> blood flow was increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> because of the
          coincident meal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver Vm</ENAMEX> was increased
          from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.1 to 2.5</NUMEX> because of the induced ethanol effect [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] and the muscle blood flow was doubled. Also, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> "concunit [vein]" was set = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, indicating that
          the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood venous</ENAMEX> concentration was used as the
          input data.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4Bshows</NUMEX> the output of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> when the
          "findabsorption" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] option was applied to the oral
          ethanol input data. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and oral data used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Aand 4Bwere</ENAMEX> collected in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> under
          identical conditions, exactly the same PBPK parameters
          where used for both calculations. The open squares show
          the time course of the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> ethanol absorption
          (amount entering the liver in the portal vein [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ).
          The solid line is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameter approximation to the
          absorption data (absorption at time t = A [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H+T H</ENAMEX>)]
          where A = total absorption, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H = Hill</ENAMEX> exponent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = half
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>).
          It can be seen that the intestinal absorption (fig.
          4B) is complete within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 2 hours</TIMEX>. The total predicted
          absorption of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> millimoles is slightly less than the
          actual total oral dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> millimoles. Although this
          is consistent with a small amount of gastric mucosal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 millimoles</NUMEX>) it is probably not
          significant. The calculation of the total absorption for
          this low dose is critically dependent on the accuracy of
          the venous blood measurements at long times. Since the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX> has such a low <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.04 mM</NUMEX>), significant amounts of
          intestinal absorption could be occurring at long times
          even though the venous concentration remained close to
          zero because of the high rate of liver clearance. The
          fluctuation in the total absorption points at long times
          in fig. 4Bis caused by errors in these long time blood
          measurements.
          When the "findabsorption" option is used, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">routinely</ENAMEX> calculates the time course of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Peripheral</ENAMEX>
          Availability" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>), indicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> in fig.
          4BThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> is defined as the equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input that would
          produce the observed venous concentration. Thus, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          input with the time course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> in fig.
          4Bwould produce exactly the same blood concentration as a
          function of time as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> absorption represented by the
          open squares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> is related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> by the relation: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> =
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dose - PA. Thus</ENAMEX> for the data used for fig. 4B, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> millimoles corresponds to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">millimoles</ENAMEX> (total dose = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX>). This represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> of the
          total dose, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classical AUC</ENAMEX> approach.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> for this data was also estimated by using the
          one compartment approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Ashows</NUMEX> the
          optimized one compartment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michaelis-Menten</ENAMEX> fit to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tail</ENAMEX> of the venous ethanol data (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vm</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.68</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">millimoles/min</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.46</NUMEX> mM). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5Bshows</NUMEX> the
          corresponding fit to the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiPadova</ENAMEX> etal. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          for a doubling (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>) of the oral dose (see below).
          Not surprisingly, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> compartment model does not
          provide an accurate fit to the ethanol data. The fit is
          better for the large input dose. Using these values of Vm
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Km</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> was determined for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and oral dose by
          assuming a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">compartment model</ENAMEX> and integrating the
          liver metabolism (= VmC/(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Km+C</ENAMEX>) where C equals venous
          blood concentration) over the time. For the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, this one compartment method yielded a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX>. This
          is less than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73% estimated</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX>, but
          significantly greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiPadova et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] also measured the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels
          resulting from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> or oral input of a larger ethanol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>, total dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> millimoles for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kg</ENAMEX> model subject) and this time they also compared the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fasting</ENAMEX> and standard breakfast case. Figures 6Aand 6Bshow
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> and oral data when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethanol</ENAMEX> was taken with the same standard meal as was used
          for the data in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">figs. 4Aand 4B</TIMEX>. The parameters were
          identical to those used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">figs. 4except</TIMEX> that the liver
          Vm was reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 to 2.4</NUMEX> (a different set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were used in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of experiments). It
          can be seen from fig. 6Bthat, for this higher dose, the
          total peripheral availability (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 40</NUMEX>
          millimoles less than the total dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> millimoles,
          corresponding to a fractional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>. This is much
          less than the FPM value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> determined by using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> approach or of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> using the one compartment
          approach. The time course of the intestinal absorption
          for the two doses (compare fig. 4Band <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fig</ENAMEX>. 6B) has the
          same shape (e.g. same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficient) but occurs over a
          slightly longer time for the larger dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">= 34 minutes</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX> dose, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 minutes</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX> dose) presumably because the larger oral dose was
          ingested over a longer time (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>
          versus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>).
          Figures 7Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7Bshow</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> output for the same
          ethanol dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>) given to fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters for these experiments had the portal
          blood flow reduced back to the default fasting value.
          Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver Vm</ENAMEX> was reduced back to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>, the same
          value that was used for the fasting data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg et al</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fig 2</TIMEX>. This change in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol metabolism</ENAMEX> is
          consistent with earlier observations that the rate of
          ethanol disappearance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> is increased by a
          coincident meal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . It can be seen in fig. 7Bthat
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>) is nearly identical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> (squares) so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to zero</NUMEX> for the
          fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> and one compartment approach
          also indicate a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> for this case.
        
      
      
        Discussion and conclusions
        
          Validity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> model
          The philosophy behind the use and development of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PKQuest</ENAMEX> differs from that of the standard PBPK
          applications. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have usually been applied to
          animal data where it is possible to accurately measure
          and control the relevant parameters (tissue distribution,
          organ blood flows, etc.). In contrast, for human studies,
          not only are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters poorly characterized,
          but they are subject to large individual variation. The
          impetus behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is to try and develop a "standard"
          set of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters that can be applied in the
          absence of this detailed information. For this reason,
          the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> to human data should be
          regarded as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation.
          Since muscle represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 50%</NUMEX> of the body mass,
          the muscle blood flow, which can vary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> fold or more
          depending on experimental conditions, is the single most
          important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameter and the parameter that limits
          the accuracy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The pharmacokinetics of D
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> (or other tracers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) are
          especially simple since the rate of elimination is very
          slow and it distributes simply in the organ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. As
          shown by figs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Aand 1B</ENAMEX>, the D 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> kinetics are sensitive to the
          muscle blood flow and the data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schloerb et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          was used to determine the resting muscle blood flow value
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.0266 liters/min/Kg</ENAMEX>) for the "standardhuman". Although
          it is problematical to base such an important parameter
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> set of measurements on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX>, this
          represents the only published measurement of this type
          that I could find. It is also an approximation to treat
          the muscle as a single compartment with a uniform blood
          flow and in some human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> muscle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartments</ENAMEX> ("resting" and "working") are included. For
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> modeling, the muscle blood flow is usually
          treated as an adjustable parameter and not as a strictly
          determined PBPK constant.
          The ethanol data that was modeled are the mean values,
          averaged over a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Because of the
          non-linear nature of the pharmacokinetics, it is an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX> to treat these mean values as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of an equivalent "average" human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
          However, it should provide a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBPK</ENAMEX> parameters of an "average" human. For the common
          case where the published mean values are the only data
          that is available, there is no other option.
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> modeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, it is assumed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethanol</ENAMEX> distributes freely in the tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. This
          seems like a reasonable assumption given the
          physical-chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. Measurements of
          plasma/whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> concentration ratios show that this
          assumption is valid for red blood cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . However,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 19</NUMEX> ] has shown that the ethanol
          volume of distribution estimated using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> compartment
          model is significantly less than the total water volume
          and they have reviewed the literature that suggests that
          the tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> distribution may be restricted.
          Despite this, the agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> results and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg et al.</ENAMEX> data (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) indicate that this
          assumption is a useful approximation given the
          limitations of using the mean data.
        
        
          Ethanol first pass metabolism and intestinal
          absorption
          The definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rigorous</ENAMEX> and intuitive. It is based on defining a time

          dependent "peripheral availability" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) that is equal to
          the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input that would produce the observed time
          course of the plasma ethanol concentration. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> is a
          direct quantitative measure of the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> that
          has reached the systemic circulation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> is then
          defined as the difference between the total dose
          administered and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PA.</ENAMEX> The classical procedure of
          determining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> (eq<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>) markedly
          overestimates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>. For the case of the small ethanol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dose</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>) taken with a meal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> estimate of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractional FPM</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> was about twice the value (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>)
          obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. For the higher dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>)
          the error was even larger (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>). Although the
          more recent one compartment approximation provides a
          better estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>, it is still significantly larger
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> values (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX>
          dose and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX> dose).
          The error in both these approximations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> results
          primarily from the fact that the systemic appearance of
          the oral ethanol taken with a meal is slow compared to
          the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minute</TIMEX> constant infusion that was used to obtain
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV AUC</ENAMEX>. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver ethanol metabolism</ENAMEX> saturates
          at low concentrations, the shorter dose will have a
          higher average blood concentration and a corresponding
          lower value of fractional metabolism. The error would be
          less if the time course of the oral absorption was
          similar to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> input. This explains why the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] was greatly reduced when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were fasting so that the gastric emptying rate
          was increased and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GI</ENAMEX> absorption was more rapid (compare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6Band 7B</ENAMEX>) and closer to the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> infusion.
          The critical dependence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> on the rate of
          systemic ethanol input was first pointed out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagner</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . He showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> for the oral input was
          equal to (or even larger than) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV AUC</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infusion</ENAMEX> was administered at a slower rate (for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>)
          than the rate of intestinal absorption.
          Failure to appreciate the problems inherent in using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUC</ENAMEX> or one compartment method to measure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> has led
          to the concept that the gastric mucosa metabolizes a
          significant fraction of oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieber</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colleague</ENAMEX> observed that the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">FPM</ENAMEX>" was reduced when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethanol</ENAMEX> was infused intraduodenally compared to the
          standard oral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and concluded that the
          difference must have resulted from gastric mucosa
          metabolism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . This decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX> for the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">intradudenal</TIMEX> dose is probably a result of the much more
          rapid time course of absorption when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> is
          administered directly into the duodenum. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> provides
          a direct estimate of the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> reaching the
          liver. As shown by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">figs. 4B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6Band 7B</ENAMEX>, the total amount
          of absorbed ethanol reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> does not differ
          significantly from the total oral dose, indicating that
          gastric mucosa metabolism is negligible.
          In addition to providing a direct measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> also provides, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time,
          quantitative information about the rate of intestinal
          absorption of an orally administered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that has
          non-linear metabolism. A comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">figs.</ENAMEX> 6Band
          7Bprovides a dramatic view of the decreased rate of
          ethanol absorption when it is accompanied by a meal. In
          the fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> is almost completely absorbed
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 minutes</TIMEX> (fig. 7B) while the ethanol
          administered with a standard breakfast takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or more
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> for complete absorption (fig. 6B). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levitt et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] simultaneously measured the rate of human gastric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emptying</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol blood</ENAMEX> concentration with and without
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and concluded that the rate of ethanol absorption
          was primarily limited by the rate of gastric emptying.
          The similarity between the time course of ethanol
          absorption seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">figs. 6Band 7Band</TIMEX> the gastric emptying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levitt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] supports
          this conclusion.
        
        
          Simulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol blood</ENAMEX> levels after oral
          intake
          Another feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX> is that it provides a
          simple interface that can be used to make quantitative
          predictions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels produced by different
          oral doses. As shown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">figs. 4B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6Band 7B</ENAMEX>, PKQuest
          routinely fits the time course of the intestinal
          absorption with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> type equation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absorption</ENAMEX> at time t = A [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t H+T H</ENAMEX>)] where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">A</ENAMEX> = total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H = Hill</ENAMEX> exponent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time). This 3
          parameter input function can then be used as the input
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKQuest</ENAMEX>. For example, the intestinal absorption
          input function that was determined for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gm/Kg</ENAMEX> dose
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol ingested</ENAMEX> with a meal (see fig. 6B) can be used
          for a model simulation using the following settings for
          finput:
          ninput:=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>;findabs:=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>;finput [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] :=
          table([organ=liver, type=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, rate=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">524</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tbeg</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>,
          tend=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48.28</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hn</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.87</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">csteady</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          This corresponds to a total input of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">524</NUMEX> millimoles
          into the portal vein ("organ = liver") with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"hn"</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.87</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half time</TIMEX> ("tend") of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48.28 minutes</TIMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8shows</TIMEX> that the simulated blood
          level for this input function (solid line) slightly
          underestimates the peak value, but otherwise is in good
          agreement with the experimental data (squares) that was
          used to determine this input function. In Figure 9this
          feature is used to illustrate the dramatic effect of a
          concomitant meal on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels resulting from an
          oral intake. The figure shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> levels for an
          oral intake of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> millimoles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> (red line,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one 12 ounce</NUMEX> can of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          (green) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> (blue) times this dose, all ingested for a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minute</TIMEX> time period either with ("fed") or without
          ("fasted") a meal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> results for the "fed" case
          (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, left) used the above rate of intestinal
          absorption determined from the data in fig. 6B. The
          "fasted" case (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, right) used the intestinal
          absorption rate determined for the fasting data in fig.
          7B(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coefficient</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.84</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>). In
          addition, the corresponding values of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver Vm</ENAMEX> and portal
          blood flow for the fed and fasting conditions are used in
          this simulation. The influence of a meal on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol blood</ENAMEX>
          levels is especially dramatic at the low intake dose,
          decreasing the peak blood level by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4</NUMEX> fold.
