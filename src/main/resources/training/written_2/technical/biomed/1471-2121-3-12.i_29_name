        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterotrimeric G</ENAMEX> proteins <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> agonist-activated
        heptahelical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to a variety of effector responses.
        For the most part, this signaling activity takes place at
        the plasma membranes of cells. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have
        been detected at a variety of subcellular locations and
        have been implicated in numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> trafficking
        activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This suggests that distinct, though
        not yet determined, mechanisms exist to target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> to subcellular locations other than plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> (PM). Furthermore, post-transcriptional or
        post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">translational</ENAMEX> modifications may play a role in
        directing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> to a specific intracellular
        location.
        Unique subcellular localization has been observed for a
        novel alternative spliced form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> α subunit
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX>), α 
        i2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . This α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">splice</ENAMEX> variant, termed sα 
        i2 , contains a novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        sequence that replaces the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of α 
        i2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . sα 
        i2 has been observed to localize to
        Golgi membranes and other intracellular membranes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] ;
        in contrast, wild type α 
        i2 is typically found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>. Based on
        this unique localization of sα 
        i2 , a prominent role in membrane
        trafficking has been proposed for this subunit [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, no report to date has supported a functional role
        for sα 
        i2 in vesicular transport, although a
        variety of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> have implicated other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX>,
        including α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> and α 
        i3 , in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vesicle</ENAMEX> trafficking pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] .
        In spite of its unknown functional significance, sα 
        i2 provides a potential model for
        studying mechanisms of subcellular localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX>.
        Clearly, some aspect of the novel splicing is responsible
        for the difference in subcellular targeting of sα 
        i2 ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> and intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membranes</ENAMEX>) compared to wild type α 
        i2 ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>). To address the mechanism
        of subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX> were tested herein.
        First, the possibility was tested that the novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of sα 
        i2 functions as a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> or
        intracellular membrane targeting motif. A second
        possibility was suggested by considering the location of
        the splice site. Several studies have shown that deletions
        or amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> in the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> creates a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> defective in
        guanine-nucleotide binding [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . Rapid release
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guanine-nucleotides</ENAMEX> can result in an unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        ] . This leads to the prediction that sα 
        i2 is also unstable due to a disruption
        in the structure of its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">C-terminus</ENAMEX> caused by the novel
        splice sequence. Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility is that
        failure of sα 
        i2 to localize at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> but instead
        localize at intracellular membranes is the result of a
        general defect in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> stability. Results presented
        herein are consistent with this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hypothesis.
      
      
        Results
        α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 differ only at their extreme
        C-termini. Alternative splicing results in a novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in sα 
        i2 that replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> of α 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In the studies presented
        here, both α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 contain an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX> epitope, as
        used previously for α 
        i2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . The use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EE</ENAMEX> epitope
        allows the direct comparison of subcellular localization
        and expression of α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 , and facilitates immunoprecipitation
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This is essential since
        suitable antibodies to detect and immuno-isolate sα 
        i2 are not readily available. Attempts
        to use a previously described polyclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> directed
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of sα 
        i2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] were unsatisfactory in our
        hands. In particular, attempts to detect endogenous sα 
        i2 by immunofluorescence failed due to
        faint detection that showed drastically different patterns
        of staining depending upon fixation technique.
        The subcellular localization of expressed α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 was compared in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX> and BHK cells
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In both cell types, α 
        i2 was detected at cellular plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> as highlighted by bright staining at the cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">periphery</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Aand 2C</ENAMEX>). In contrast, sα 
        i2 was not detected at plasma membranes,
        but instead typically displayed an intracellular and
        perinuclear staining pattern (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Band 2D</ENAMEX>), consistent
        with localization to intracellular membranes as previously
        described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . The subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 showed overlap in immunofluorescent
        staining with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, β-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">COP</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 3B</ENAMEX>)
        and the endoplasmic reticulum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein PDI</ENAMEX> (Figure 3Cand
        3D); localization of sα 
        i2 exclusively to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golgi</ENAMEX> was not
        observed, even at the lowest levels of detection.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fractionation</ENAMEX> confirmed that sα 
        i2 was localized, at least partly, to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2E</NUMEX>). After lysis of cells in hypotonic
        buffer followed by high-speed centrifugation, α 
        i2 was found predominantly in the
        particulate fraction from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2E</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX>) or
        BHK cells (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2E</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 and 10</TIMEX>). A majority of sα 
        i2 was also detected in the particulate
        fraction from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2E</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 6</TIMEX>) and BHK
        cells (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2E</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 and 12</TIMEX>), although some was also
        found in the soluble fraction. As a comparison, a
        non-palmitoylated mutant of α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q</ENAMEX> , in which cysteines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 and 10</NUMEX> have
        been substituted with serines, is found predominantly in
        the soluble fraction (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2E</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 and 8</TIMEX>), as
        described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Surprisingly, in comparison
        to α 
        i2 , sα 
        i2 was always detected in fewer cells,
        by immunofluorescence analysis, and showed lower levels of
        protein expression, by western blot analysis of subcellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fractions</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2E</NUMEX>) or whole cell lysates (not shown).
        These expression differences suggested that sα 
        i2 was either less efficiently expressed
        or more rapidly degraded compared to α 
        i2 , as described below.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of sα 
        i2 , which replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of α 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), have been proposed to
        function as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> targeting signal [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . To test the
        potential importance of this C-terminal region in
        localization of sα 
        i2 to intracellular membranes and
        prevention of sα 
        i2 from localizing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, a deletion
        mutant of α 
        i2 was constructed consisting of amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acids 1-331</ENAMEX>. In sα 
        i2 , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal splice occurs just
        after amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 331</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and thus the novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid splice sequence</ENAMEX> is removed in α 
        i2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-331</ENAMEX>). Immunofluorescence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> indicates that α 
        i2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-331</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>) displays a
        subcellular localization pattern very similar to sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). This result is
        consistent with the alternative hypothesis that a
        disruption of α 
        i2 at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> creates a protein
        unable to localize at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>.
        If the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of sα 
        i2 functions as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> targeting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>, it is important to test whether it is sufficient to
        target a heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to intracellular membranes.
        When the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> was fused to the C-terminus
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> (GFP-sα 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">35aa</ENAMEX>), this unique sα 
        i2 sequence failed to direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> to
        intracellular membranes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>); GFP-sα 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35aa</TIMEX> was diffusely distributed
        throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, similar to what is
        observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> alone (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). On the other hand, when
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of α 
        i2 are fused to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> to create α 
        i2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-10</ENAMEX>)-GFP, fluorescence is detected
        strongly at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5C</NUMEX>), indicating the N-terminus
        of α 
        i2 , which contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myristoylation</ENAMEX> and palmitoylation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , can be
        sufficient for directing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization of a normally
        cytosolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In agreement with these results, the sα 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal sequence failed to
        redirect the localization of a secreted or a nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, not only is the unique sα 
        i2 sequence unable to override other
        localization signals, it is unable to target a cytoplasmic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to intracellular membranes. These results are
        consistent with a lack of a specific role for the sα 
        i2 sequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golgi</ENAMEX> membrane
        targeting.
        The above experimental results failed to support the
        hypothesis that the unique <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> from sα 
        i2 serves as a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> or
        intracellular membrane targeting motif. Thus, the following
        experiments concentrated on addressing the alternative
        hypothesis: sα 
        i2 is unstable and rapidly degraded due
        to disruptions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>, and such instability
        results in a failure of sα 
        i2 to reach its proper place at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>.
        The ability of α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 to undergo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal lipid
        modifications was compared. Myristoylation occurs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-translationally at the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal glycine, while
        palmitoylation occurs post-translationally at a cysteine
        immediately after the myristoylated glycine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcellular</ENAMEX> site where palmitoylation occurs has not been
        well defined, although in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> model palmitoylation occurs
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Cells expressing α 
        i2 or sα 
        i2 were metabolically labeled with
        3H-palmitate or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3H</NUMEX>-myristate. α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 were immunoprecipitated from cell
        extracts, and incorporation of radio-label was analyzed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE followed by fluorography (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). No
        palmitoylation of sα 
        i2 was detected (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>),
        although α 
        i2 was strongly palmitoylated (Figure
        6A, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In contrast, both α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 incorporated similar levels or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myristate</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 6</TIMEX>). The similar level of
        myristoylation was particularly surprising since total sα 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was much lower than α 
        i2 as determined by immunoblotting of
        the immunoprecipitates (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B</TIMEX>, compare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 6</TIMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myristoylation</ENAMEX> is a co-translational modification, and
        levels of radio-labeling should thus reflect synthesis of
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, the myristoylation results
        (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6Aand 6B</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 6</TIMEX>) strongly suggested that α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 are translated equally well, as
        evidenced by similar levels of radiolabeled myristate
        incorporation during the labeling period, but sα 
        i2 is more rapidly degraded, as seen by
        reduced steady-state levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoprecipitated protein</ENAMEX>.
        The lack of palmitoylation of sα 
        i2 is consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>, not
        necessarily mutually exclusive, possibilities. sα 
        i2 may fail to undergo palmitoylation
        because it is not stable long enough for post-translational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palmitoylation</ENAMEX> to occur or because it fails to reach a PM
        site of palmitoylation. Alternatively, the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        sequence of sα 
        i2 may somehow prevent direct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> by a palmitoyl transferase.
        Cells expressing high levels of sα 
        i2 , and to a much lesser extent α 
        i2 , often displayed very bright
        intracellular accumulations of sα 
        i2 as visualized by immunofluorescence.
        These large spots were reminiscent of recently described
        aggresomes, accumulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misfolded protein</ENAMEX> that are
        being targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX>
        ] . This observation suggested the possibility that
        intracellular localization of sα 
        i2 may reflect targeting to a
        proteasome-dependent degradative pathway. To test this idea
        further, cells expressing α 
        i2 or sα 
        i2 were treated with the proteasome
        inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal</ENAMEX> (ALLN) and
        changes in localization of the α subunit were analyzed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1h</TIMEX> treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX>, α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> is relatively unaffected
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7C</NUMEX>), but sα 
        i2 begins to show a slight increase in
        distinct intracellular accumulations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7D</NUMEX>). At <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 h</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX> treatment, many cells expressing α 
        i2 display a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization
        and an increase in intracellular staining (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7E</NUMEX>). α 
        i2 is typically seen in large bright
        spots and in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perinuclear</ENAMEX>/intracellular membrane staining
        pattern after incubation of cells for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX>. In
        fact, the localization pattern of α 
        i2 after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h incubation with ALLN
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7E</NUMEX>) is similar to the observed localization of sα 
        i2 in the absence or presence of ALLN
        treatment (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7D</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7F</ENAMEX>). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> h treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX>, both α 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7G</NUMEX>) and sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7H</NUMEX>) are detected almost
        exclusively as a large bright spot in each expressing cell.
        Similar results were obtained using another proteasome
        inhibitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MG-132</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ALLN</ENAMEX> treatment was
        relatively ineffective at promoting accumulation of
        overexpressed α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> in aggresome-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (not
        shown). Thus, the results of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7are</NUMEX> consistent with
        the proposal that the intracellular localization of sα 
        i2 is due to its targeting to a
        degradative pathway, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> shared by α 
        i2 .
        The subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 was compared to α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX>. This alanine to serine
        mutation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region of α 
        i1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A326S</NUMEX>) and α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A366S</NUMEX>) has been shown to greatly
        accelerate GDP release, to accelerate irreversible
        inactivation 
        in vitro , and to cause rapid
        turnover of the α subunit in cultured cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        Thus, if the observed intracellular localization of sα 
        i2 is caused by instability of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> due to disruptions at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>, then it
        follows that α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A327S</ENAMEX> should show a similar pattern
        of localization. Indeed, immunofluorescence microscopy
        revealed a pronounced intracellular distribution for α 
        i2 A327S (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8E</NUMEX>). In addition to
        intracellular membrane localization similar to sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8C</NUMEX>), α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX> was detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">weakly</ENAMEX> but
        consistently at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>. It seems likely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        disruption of sα 
        i2 (replacing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acids</ENAMEX>) is a more severe disruption than the A327S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX>. Thus, the similarity in localization of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 A327S bolsters the idea that
        mislocalization of sα 
        i2 is caused by its inherent
        instability.
        G <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein βγ subunits</ENAMEX> can stabilize wild type and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alanine</ENAMEX> to serine mutant α subunits 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the effect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">βγ</ENAMEX> co-expression on subcellular localization of α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A327S</ENAMEX> and sα 
        i2 was tested. α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">localizes</ENAMEX> to the PM efficiently when
        expressed alone (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8A</NUMEX>) or when co-expressed with βγ
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8B</NUMEX>). sα 
        i2 shows a dramatic change in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> when co-expressed with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">βγ</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8D</NUMEX>),
        displaying strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> staining. Not only is sα 
        i2 targeted efficiently to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed with βγ, but βγ co-expression increases
        overall levels of transiently expressed sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 , as determined by immunoblotting
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8G</NUMEX>), and increases the number of cells expressing
        sα 
        i2 , as observed by immunofluorescence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> (not shown). Similarly, co-expression of βγ
        efficiently promotes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization of α 
        i2 A327S (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8F</NUMEX>).
        The analysis of the effect of βγ was extended by
        examining the localization of α 
        i2 or sα 
        i2 after co-transfection with βγ and
        after treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX>. In contrast to Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, a
        marked difference was observed between α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX> treatment. When βγ is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expressed with α 
        i2 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization of α 
        i2 is observed, as shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8B</TIMEX>,
        and incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 h</TIMEX> shows little effect on PM
        localization of α 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9A</NUMEX>). When βγ is co-expressed
        with sα 
        i2 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization of sα 
        i2 is observed, as shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8D</TIMEX>,
        but incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> h causes an increase in
        bright intracellular accumulations of sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9B</NUMEX>). Taken together, results
        with βγ co-expression are consistent with the ability of βγ
        to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> targeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX>, and further suggest that sα 
        i2 is less effectively stabilized than α
        
        i2 by βγ, as evidenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLN</ENAMEX>-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in intracellular aggregates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9B</NUMEX>).
        Lastly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35S</NUMEX>-methionine pulse-chase labeling studies
        directly confirmed that sα 
        i2 was more rapidly degraded than α 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). After transient
        expression of the α subunits, cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
        radiolabeled with a brief pulse of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35S</NUMEX>-methionine followed
        by a chase. Immunoprecipitation of the α subunit after
        increasing times of chase, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fluorography</ENAMEX> revealed that radiolabeled sα 
        i2 was rapidly lost. α 
        i2 consistently displayed a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4</ENAMEX> fold
        longer half-life compared to sα 
        i2 , while α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX> was intermediate. In the
        experiment presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, the t 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1/2</ENAMEX> was determined to be approximately
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90, 180</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">360 min</NUMEX> for sα 
        i2 , α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX>, and α 
        i2 , respectively. Although this trend
        was consistent, the exact t 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1/2</TIMEX> showed some variability from
        experiment to experiment, probably due to varying levels of
        transient overexpression. It is likely that the difference
        in turnover of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 is even more profound when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are expressed at lower levels. Consistent with
        this idea, sα 
        i2 was refractory to stable expression
        even though cells stably expressing α 
        i2 were easily selected (not shown). The
        inability to isolate cells stably expressing sα 
        i2 can be attributed to its rapid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>. Regardless, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">35S-methionine pulse-chase</ENAMEX>
        labeling studies (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) demonstrate that sα 
        i2 is indeed more rapidly degraded than
        α 
        i2 .
      
      
        Discussion
        In addition to their well characterized role at the PM
        in coupling activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GPCRs</ENAMEX> to effector <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterotrimeric G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been implicated in a variety
        of other cellular functions, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> trafficking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. A splice variant of α 
        i2 , termed sα 
        i2 , has been proposed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to
        regulate vesicle transport due to its localization at
        intracellular membranes. The studies described in this
        report were undertaken to define mechanisms that underlie
        subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 . The novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> found in
        sα 
        i2 appear not to function as a specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> or endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence. Instead,
        the results in this study support the proposal that sα 
        i2 fails to target to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> because it
        is an unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The following results support this
        hypothesis: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 are equally labeled by a pulse of
        3H-myristate, although much less sα 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is detected; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) sα 
        i2 displays a propensity to localize to
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggresome</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and this localization
        is greatly enhanced by proteasome inhibitor treatment; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
        the α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A327S mutant</ENAMEX>, previously shown to be
        unstable and defective in guanine-nucleotide binding, shows
        a similar pattern of subcellular localization ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, intracellular membranes rather
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) βγ over-expression increases expression of sα 
        i2 and promotes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX>, but βγ co-expression does not
        prevent sα 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> to potential
        aggresome-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> when cells are treated with
        proteasome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) pulse-chase analysis
        indicates that sα 
        i2 is rapidly degraded.
        A number of reports have demonstrated that disruptions
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>termini of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gα</ENAMEX> cause reduced affinity for
        guanine-nucleotides and protein instability. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        30 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> consist of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">β6-α5</ENAMEX> loop, followed by
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α5</NUMEX> helix and finally several amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of flexible
        structure (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">β6-α5 loop</ENAMEX>
        stabilizes the guanine ring of bound GDP or GTP, and
        mutations in this region affect guanine-nucleotide binding.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A326S</NUMEX> mutation of α 
        i1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A366S</ENAMEX> mutation of α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> (cognate to the α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A327S</ENAMEX> used in this study) were shown
        to cause greatly decreased affinity for GDP [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
        Defective binding of GDP leads to more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> in the empty
        state (no bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">guanine-nucleotide</ENAMEX>), and this form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> is
        rapidly denatured 
        in vitro , as shown for α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A366S</ENAMEX> and α 
        i1 A326S [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A366S</ENAMEX> was demonstrated to undergo
        rapid degradation (t 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1/2 < 1 h</ENAMEX>) in stably transfected
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The same mutation in α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> has also been shown to greatly
        decrease guanine-nucleotide binding [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 22</ENAMEX> ] . Additional
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the critical <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">β6-α5</ENAMEX> loop are important for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maintaining Gα</ENAMEX> integrity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α5</NUMEX> helix (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) does not directly
        contact the bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guanine-nucleotide</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] , it is
        clearly important for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gα</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and to maintain the
        proper orientation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">β6-α5</ENAMEX> loop. A recent study
        identified a number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α5</NUMEX> helix <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> that when changed to alanines
        increased rates of guanine-nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, decreased affinity for
        guanine-nucleotides) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Individual mutation of amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in α 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> , cognate to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T330</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N332</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V333</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F337</TIMEX> in
        α 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), increased nucleotide
        exchange rates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these critical amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
        N332 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V333</ENAMEX> in α 
        i2 , are in fact the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that are replaced by the novel splicing in sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, one might speculate
        that the novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> in sα 
        i2 would impair guanine-nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> and result in a unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately,
        initial attempts to directly show a defect in
        guanine-nucleotide binding by sα 
        i2 , using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPγ S-dependent</ENAMEX> trypsin
        protection assay [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , were unsuccessful due, at least
        in part, to the inability to solubilize expressed sα 
        i2 from membranes using a mild detergent
        ( 
        e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lubrol/polyoxyethylene</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-lauryl ether).
        The data in this report are consistent with a scenario
        in which intracellular Golgi/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> localization of sα 
        i2 reflects its rapid degradation rather
        than specific targeting to a subcellular organelle.
        Particularly compelling is the similarity in subcellular
        localization of α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A327S</ENAMEX> and sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). In addition, the use of
        proteasome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7and 9</NUMEX>) suggest that sα 
        i2 is degraded by a proteasome pathway.
        The observed intracellular membrane (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) localization and
        proteasome inhibitor-induced juxtanuclear aggregate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> (aggresome) is consistent with that reported
        for other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> being degraded by such a pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 24</NUMEX>
        ] . When treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteasome inhibitors</ENAMEX>, overexpressed
        wild type α 
        i2 also accumulates in aggresome-like
        structures (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> may normally be
        degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway. However,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of βγ prevents ALLN-induced juxtanuclear
        accumulations of α 
        i2 but not sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Although little is known
        regarding degradative pathways for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, sα 
        i2 and other mutants ( 
        e.g., α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A327S</ENAMEX>) may be valuable tools for
        defining such pathways.
        The data presented here argue against a sequence
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX> membrane targeting function for the novel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> found in sα 
        i2 . The novel sequence of sα 
        i2 is not sufficient to direct other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to Golgi/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER membranes</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> did
        not change the cytoplasmic localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        Similarly, a recent report showed that the sα 
        i2 35 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were unable to retain
        a secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in intracellular membranes and did not
        affect localization of a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        in addition to causing rapid degradation, one cannot rule
        out that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence of sα 
        i2 functions somehow as part of a Golgi
        targeting motif in the context of other regions of α 
        i2 , as suggested [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have described a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX> membrane
        localization of sα 
        i2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ; in contrast, the results
        presented in this report always show a much more disperse
        subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 to intracellular membranes consistent
        with staining of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>. The reason for this
        difference in localization is unclear. Interestingly, in
        the other study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found that deletion of a
        proline-rich sequence corresponding to sα 
        i2 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">348-359</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
        changed localization of sα 
        i2 from Golgi membranes to a more
        diffuse localization throughout intracellular membranes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        ] . However, mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proline residues</ENAMEX> to alanines
        failed to affect sα 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, little
        evidence exists to support a specific membrane targeting
        role for the novel sα 
        i2 sequence.
        βγ was able to promote plasma membrane localization of
        sα 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">βγ</ENAMEX> prevents irreversible
        inactivation of α 
        i1 , when measured 
        in vitro at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37°C</TIMEX>, and slows the
        inactivation of α 
        i1 A326S [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Thus, βγ may stabilize
        sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX> allowing βγ-dependent [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization. These results are also
        consistent with the possibility that the primary defect in
        sα 
        i2 is a reduced ability to interact with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">βγ; Gα</ENAMEX> containing mutations in known sites of contact with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">βγ</ENAMEX> fail to localize to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, but over-expression of βγ can
        rescue their PM localization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . However, the
        crystal structures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">β6-α5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">loop/α5</ENAMEX> helix region does not directly contact βγ. Thus, it
        is more likely that indeed sα 
        i2 is deficient in binding to βγ, but
        this effect is a consequence of its instability. sα 
        i2 may exist in a state that does not
        interact well with βγ simply because it is in the process
        of being irreversibly inactivated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Similarly, α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A327S</ENAMEX> appears not to be defective in
        its intrinsic ability to interact βγ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-expression of βγ shifts α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX>, like sα 
        i2 , from intracellular to plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>).
        What is the cellular function of sα 
        i2 ? The ability of βγ to promote PM
        localization of sα 
        i2 raises the possibility that
        endogenous sα 
        i2 is in fact localized to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> where it
        can interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> and effectors. Future studies will
        test the potential of sα 
        i2 , when co-expressed with βγ, to
        productively interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and effectors.
        However, this possibility is viewed as unlikely for several
        reasons. First, others have shown that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COS</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cells
        endogenous sα 
        i2 is not detected at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> but only found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellularly</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cannot rule out that
        a small but functionally significant fraction of sα 
        i2 reaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the extreme
        C-termini of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> are critical sites for interaction with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , and the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal sequence found in
        sα 
        i2 would be predicted to disrupt
        productive interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, even though βγ
        can promote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> localization of sα 
        i2 in the overexpression system
        described here, sα 
        i2 remains less stable than α 
        i2 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), suggesting that such
        instability may also impair productive interactions with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX>.
        On the other hand, unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>(s) may function to
        stabilize sα 
        i2 and help direct it to Golgi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX>. A specific combination of β and γ subtypes may
        play such a role; however, one thorough study showed a lack
        of βγ on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> membranes of exocrine pancreatic cells even
        though a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> were readily detected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] . Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that may specifically promote the
        intracellular targeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> have not been identified.
        It is possible that sα 
        i2 functions as a short-lived protein
        regulating some aspect of membrane transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX>;
        however, no experiments to directly support or refute this
        hypothesis have been reported. Instead, it is tempting to
        speculate that alternative splicing may be a mechanism to
        regulate cellular levels of α 
        i2 . In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, certain conditions
        may favor the formation of sα 
        i2 compared to α 
        i2 , and the resulting rapid degradation
        of sα 
        i2 would decrease the cellular content
        of α 
        i2 . A precedent for such alternative
        splicing-dependent regulation of expression has been
        described for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-ras</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Alternative splicing occurs in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-ras, and the alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spliced form</ENAMEX> is predicted to
        encode an unstable transcript and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein product</ENAMEX> that
        lacks the ability to oncogenically transform cells. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> was identified that abolishes the alternatively
        spliced form, and this mutation leads to an increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-ras expression and transforming ability. Thus, it was
        demonstrated that alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> is a mechanism that
        cells use to control expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-ras</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
        Alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> may similarly play an important role
        in regulating expression of α 
        i2 . Testing of this idea will require a
        comparison of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 transcript levels, and an analysis of
        whether relative expression is affected in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> changes, such as extracellular stimuli or
        cell differentiation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that
        sα 
        i2 , a novel splice variant of α 
        i2 , is rapidly degraded when expressed
        in cells. Such instability is consistent with known
        structure-function data regarding the importance of the
        C-terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX> subunits. The observed intracellular
        localization of sα 
        i2 is due, at least in part, to its
        instability. Moreover, the data presented in this study
        argue against the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of sα 
        i2 functioning as a specific Golgi
        targeting motif.
        In addition, similarly to sα 
        i2 , an α 
        i2 mutant, α 
        i2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A327S</TIMEX>, previously demonstrated to be
        unstable 
        in vitro , displays a defect in
        plasma membrane localization when expressed in cells. These
        results suggest that both sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A327S</ENAMEX> may prove valuable in future
        studies of mechanisms of degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gα</ENAMEX>.
