        Plasmodium falciparum , a parasitic
        protozoan, is the causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of the most lethal form
        of human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. It is responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 million</NUMEX>
        infections per year in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and regions
        throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Of these
        clinical cases, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.1 million</NUMEX> result in death
        annually [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In areas where mosquito abatement has
        failed, chemotherapy, consisting of a limited selection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antimalarial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, is the only defense against this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The increase in drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> throughout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria endemic</ENAMEX> regions is cause for great concern and
        calls for the development of new antimalarial measures,
        which would involve a larger variety of drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> as
        well as a wider array of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> strategies (reviewed in [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]).
        The study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> will be greatly helped by the
        publicly available complete genome sequence of 
        P. falciparum . The sequencing
        project, driven by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanger Centre</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomic Research</ENAMEX> (TIGR), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> is
        essentially complete [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The sequence of the completed
        chromosomes are available for download from each sequencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> and from the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodium Genome Resource</ENAMEX>, PlasmoDB
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Preliminary analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">megabase-pair</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>)
        
        P. falciparum genome indicates the
        presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> spread across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, a circular plastid genome and a mitochondrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 60%</NUMEX> of the predicted open
        reading frames (ORFs) lack orthologs in other genomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        This fact underscores the need to elucidate gene function,
        yet many of the tools that have propelled the study of
        model organisms remain inefficient or nonexistent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodium</ENAMEX> . Despite recent
        improvements in 
        P. falciparum transformation
        techniques, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] the efficiency of stable transfection
        under a direct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> selection remains <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10 -6</NUMEX>,
        making knockout and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> replacement experiments difficult,
        and genetic complementation strategies nearly impossible.
        Genome-wide expression profiling by microarray technology
        provides an easy alternative for the functional genomic
        exploration of 
        P. falciparum. 
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> has proved a powerful tool. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Profiling</ENAMEX> has been
        used to gain important insights into processes such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, responses to environmental perturbations, gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, pathogen and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> response, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8, 9,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>]. Expression profiling has already been
        successfully applied to the partial genome sequence of 
        P. falciparum , and has been used to
        characterize the role of previously unannotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>].
        Here we present the design and assembly of a
        long-oligonucleotide 
        P. falciparum gene-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> using the currently available genomic sequence
        generated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaria Genome Consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20</TIMEX>].
        During the course of this work, we have developed software,
        improved by experimental data and an open-source policy,
        for rapidly selecting unique sequences from predicted ORFs
        of any genome. Subsequently, we constructed a
        long<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">-oligonucleotide</ENAMEX>-based 
        P. falciparum microarray, which we
        used to evaluate changes in the global expression profile
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct stages of 
        P. falciparum erythrocytic-stage
        asexual development - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-trophozoite</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-schizont</TIMEX>. The
        large number of differentially expressed genes detected in
        this analysis suggests that extensive transcriptional
        regulation has a major role in the functional
        specialization of parasite development.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          P. falciparumORF predictions
          At the outset of these studies, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mbp</ENAMEX> of
          
          P. falciparum genomic sequence was
          obtained from the publicly available <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> presented by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaria Genome Consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19, 20</TIMEX>] in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. The sequence comprised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> completely assembled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, the complete mitochondrial and plastid
          genomes, and the sum of all the partial contigs from the
          remaining chromosomes. ORF predictions were carried out
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlimmerM</ENAMEX>, a gene-finding tool trained with 
          P. falciparum specific sequences [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>]. Using default parameters, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GlimmerM</ENAMEX> frequently
          yielded a large number of overlapping predictions
          (competing gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>) and thus additional filtering of
          the initial prediction output was required. As slight
          overprediction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> is generally desirable for the
          purpose of expression array <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the post-prediction
          filtering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GlimmerM</ENAMEX> output was modified with
          respect to the process used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaria Genome</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Briefly, individual predictions that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlapped</ENAMEX> and were on opposite strands or in different
          reading frames were retained. For competing predictions
          within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> GlimmerM gene model, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> that were
          extended downstream by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least 300 bp</NUMEX> and were within
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">300 bp</TIMEX> of the total size compared to the size of the
          largest prediction were chosen. In all other cases, the
          largest predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> was selected. This selection method
          resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX> ORF predictions for chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, whereas
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaria Genome Consortium</ENAMEX> selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> for the same
          chromosome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of predictions, carried out on the
          publicly available genomic sequence as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2000</TIMEX>,
          yielded <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8,008 putative</NUMEX> ORFs. The predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> are
          available as additional data with the online version of
          this paper (see Additional data files) and from [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. As
          a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step to annotation, the translation of all
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> were used to search the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astral, SwissProt</ENAMEX>,
          and non-redundant (NR) databases for sequence
          similarities using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith-Waterman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. In
          addition, all ORF predictions were linked to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PlasmoDB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          ArrayOligoSelector: array element design
          To construct a gene-specific microarray of the 
          P. falciparum genome, we designed
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mer oligonucleotide array elements. We chose this
          length for a number of reasons. Long oligonucleotides are
          a highly sensitive alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products and
          provide a means to readily distinguish between genes with
          high degrees of sequence similarity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. In addition,
          the presence of various types of repetitive sequences and
          highly homologous gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the AT-rich 
          P. falciparum genome contributes to
          a high rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PCR failure</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.L.D.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          results). A software program, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX>, was
          developed specifically for the purpose of systematically
          selecting gene-specific long oligonucleotide probes for
          entire genomes. The latest version and complete source
          code for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> is freely available at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
          For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>, the program optimizes the oligonucleotide
          selection on the basis of several parameters, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uniqueness</ENAMEX> in the genome, sequence complexity, lack of
          self-binding, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Similar
          approaches to oligonucleotide design have previously been
          described, but the exact algorithms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> code, and/or
          accompanying hybridization data are not available [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>].
          ArrayOligoSelector helps ensure complete genome
          coverage and optimal array hybridization while avoiding
          several potential problems originating from the peculiar
          characteristics of the 
          P. falciparum genome. The algorithm
          attempts to minimize cross-hybridization between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> and other regions of the genome. To
          evaluate the potential for cross-hybridization, early
          versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> used a simple BLASTN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">alignment</ENAMEX> identity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Although this method prevents
          the selection of troublesome sequences, it does not take
          into account the effect of mismatch distribution or base
          composition. Subsequent versions of ArrayOligoSelector
          were improved by calculating a theoretical energy of
          binding between the oligonucleotide and its most probable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-hybridization target in the genome ('second best
          target'). The binding energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kcal/mol</ENAMEX>) is calculated
          using a nearest-neighbor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> using established
          thermodynamic parameters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35</TIMEX>]. Thus,
          a sequence with high cross-hybridization potential will
          have a more stable binding energy with a larger absolute
          value. In contrast, a sequence unique in the genome will
          yield a smaller absolute value for the binding energy. A
          representative plot of the calculated binding energies
          for all possible <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 bp oligonucleotides</NUMEX> from a putative 
          var <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PlasmoDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v4.0</ENAMEX> annotated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gene ID PF08</ENAMEX>_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0140</TIMEX>) is shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>.
          An important aspect of oligonucleotide design for
          microarray hybridization is avoiding secondary structures
          within the oligonucleotide, as these are likely to be
          detrimental to hybridization performance. To avoid
          selecting oligonucleotides with secondary complex
          structure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>-Waterman
          algorithm with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAM47 DNA matrix</ENAMEX> to calculate the
          optimal alignment score between the candidate
          oligonucleotide sequence and the reverse complement of
          that sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. A high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>-Waterman score
          indicates the potential to create secondary structures
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
          The presence of low-complexity sequence could also
          result in significant nonspecific cross-hybridization.
          For example, the 
          P. falciparum genome contains a
          large number of low-complexity sequence elements as a
          result of a high frequency of continuous stretches of A
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> nucleotides in both the non-coding and the coding
          regions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> automatically detects such
          sequences by subjecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to a lossless compression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. The
          compression score, calculated as the difference in bytes
          between the original sequence and the compressed version,
          is inversely proportional to complexity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>).
          Using this score, repeats of essentially any nature are
          detected in a computationally efficient manner.
          In addition, in order to avoid specific sequence
          features, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> supports filtering based on
          user-defined patterns. This feature can be used to
          implement filtering rules based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">empirically</ENAMEX> derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Finally, the melting temperature of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> is largely determined by its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content.
          As is the case with most ORFs, there exists a large range
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> values (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 10</NUMEX> to > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> bp window
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2d</NUMEX>). For this reason, a user-defined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>GC target
          range is used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> such that the
          majority of the array elements will share a similar base
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX> and hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> across the
          array.
          Given the above parameters, ArrayOligoSelector
          evaluates every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mer sequence within an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> and chooses
          an optimal set on the following criteria. The
          uniqueness-filter requires oligonucleotides to satisfy
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX> simultaneous threshold criteria based on the
          calculation of the binding energy to their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-best
          target (the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> is itself). First, the
          oligonucleotide must rank among the top <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the unique
          or almost unique <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mers in the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, its
          binding energy must be within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 kcal</TIMEX>/mol of the best
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>. In addition, an optional
          user-defined energy threshold can operate in conjunction
          with the default threshold. Initial settings for the
          low-complexity and the self-binding terms allow the
          top-scoring <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mers to pass to the next selection
          step. Finally, an optional 'user-defined sequence filter'
          simply eliminates the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> containing the
          defined sequences. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> filters operate on the
          entire set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> and
          generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent output sets. The intersection
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> outputs is then subjected to the final
          selection. If no common oligonucleotide is identified in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> intersection, the self-binding and complexity
          filters are incrementally relaxed until an intersection
          becomes available. The final selection of candidate
          oligonucleotides depends upon <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">the %</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> filter and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end
          proximity ranking. Initially, oligonucleotides are
          allowed to pass if they meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-specified <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>. If
          no oligonucleotide with the desired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content is found,
          the target <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> range is relaxed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point
          in each direction until one or more oligonucleotides
          pass. As a final step, a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, closest to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the gene is chosen. Finally, ArrayOligoSelector
          generates an output file containing the oligonucleotide
          selections for each putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>.
          From our initial set of predictions, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,272</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mer oligonucleotides were selected and synthesized.
          For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our first</TIMEX> pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide selections,
          the earlier version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> utilizing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BLASTN</ENAMEX>-based identity threshold was used. The identity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cutoff</ENAMEX> was adjusted to a very conservative value of <
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 bp</TIMEX> of identity. The initial setting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> was set to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">73°C T</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> . Subsequently, with the release of
          additional sequence information, a new set of predictions
          was generated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2002</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 1,025</NUMEX>
          oligonucleotides were selected using the upgraded version
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX>. In this selection, the
          user-defined uniqueness threshold was set at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-35</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kcal/mol</ENAMEX>, the value at which cross-hybridization is
          essentially eliminated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content target
          was set at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>. The sequence and location of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> is available online [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The
          experiments described in the following section were
          conducted with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of predictions only. As
          additional annotations become available for the whole
          genome sequence, additional oligonucleotides will be
          selected and added to the existing collection. We expect
          the final set to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 8,500</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Oligonucleotide performance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mer
          oligonucleotides make highly sensitive specific
          microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for expression profiling of 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> used in that study were synthesized 
          in situ using ink-jet technology
          whereas the oligonucleotides used in our study were
          commercially synthesized and subsequently printed using
          mechanical deposition. Similarly to the experiments of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> , we wished to test
          experimentally the effect of mismatches on sensitivity
          and specificity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mer oligonucleotides in the context
          of a complex hybridization mixture ( 
          P. falciparum total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
          separate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> ORF predictions were arbitrarily
          selected for analysis and for each of these ORFs a set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> oligonucleotides were synthesized. The first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> in each set represents the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mer</ENAMEX> selection from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX>. Each successive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> within a set contains an increasing
          number of mutations made in increments of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. Thus, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> oligonucleotide in each set had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> bases (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>)
          altered, while the last oligonucleotide had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> bases
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>) mutated. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> (Figure
          4a,4b<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>c<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>d<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>e), which is referred to as the 'distributed
          set', both the position and the identity of each mutation
          was random. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> (Figure
          4g<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">,4h,4i,4j,4</NUMEX>k), referred to as the 'anchored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">set</ENAMEX>', the
          mutations in each oligonucleotide were limited to the
          ends of the sequence. In this manner, a contiguous
          stretch of perfectly matched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> was always preserved
          in the center of each oligonucleotide.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4summarizes</NUMEX> normalized hybridization
          intensities of control oligonucleotides obtained from the
          global gene-expression comparisons between trophozoite
          and schizont stages. The results originate from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          microarray hybridizations presented in Figure 5and 10
          additional hybridizations available as additional data
          files [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The resulting hybridization intensity
          measurements for each oligonucleotide were averaged
          across all hybridizations and scaled as a fraction of the
          average intensity of the perfect-match oligonucleotide
          for each set. As is evident from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4a,4b,4c,4d,4e</NUMEX>,
          the presence of internal mismatches (bubbles and bulges)
          had a large effect on hybridization performance:
          oligonucleotides with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> mismatches (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>) suffered
          an average reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> in hybridization intensity
          when compared to the perfect match, while
          oligonucleotides with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>) or more mismatches
          were reduced by an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4f</NUMEX>). For the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anchored</ENAMEX> set (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 4g,4h,4i,4j,4</NUMEX>k), a more gradual
          hybridization trend was observed. Mutating the terminal
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> bases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each end</TIMEX>) resulted in an average
          loss of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX> of the maximal hybridization intensity. Not
          until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> bases had been mutated (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each end</TIMEX>)
          did the relative intensity of hybridization drop by an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.5%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4l</NUMEX>). In agreement with the
          findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], the data from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anchored</ENAMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> reveal a strong
          relationship between the length of contiguous match (the
          equivalent of oligonucleotide length) and overall
          hybridization performance.
          To measure the extent to which the energy calculation
          implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> matches reality, we
          have plotted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3the</NUMEX> calculated energy of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> oligos shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4and</NUMEX> their relative
          intensities of hybridization. The calculated energy and
          relative intensity of hybridization correlate at | 
          r | = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.91</NUMEX>. For comparison, the
          relative intensity of hybridization and number of
          nucleotide identities correlate at | 
          r | = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>. This indicates that a
          calculated binding energy approach may be used to
          estimate the potential for cross-hybridization for any
          sequence relative to the rest of the genome. The
          specificity for each oligonucleotide is uniquely and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computationally</ENAMEX> determined and expressed as a binding
          energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kcal/mol</ENAMEX>).
          To further address the question of specificity of
          oligonucleotide hybridization to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in a
          complex sample we introduced a set of probes targeting a
          set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> non-repetitive sequences from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae to the microarray. To
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for the nucleotide bias of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> genome
          relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, the selection criteria for this set
          were identical to selection of the plasmodial microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. The average GC content of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae oligonucleotides was
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.5%</NUMEX>, whereas the average GC content of plasmodial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32.5%</NUMEX>. The average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>-to-background ratios across all hybridizations for
          these negative control spots was less than twofold, which
          is well below the conservative fivefold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>-to-background threshold used to filter data (see
          Materials and methods). In addition, a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          hybridizations was carried out where total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from an
          asynchronous parasite culture was hybridized against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>
          products corresponding to the negative control 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae sequences. In these
          hybridizations the yeast PCR fragment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybridized</ENAMEX> strictly
          to its cognate sequence, while the average signal to
          background value for plasmodial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.17 ± 0.05</NUMEX>. In no individual case did a
          plasmodial element yield a signal greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.3%</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> hydridization signal intensity. The results of
          these microarray hybridizations are available as
          additional data files [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
          To assess whether separate oligonucleotides designed
          to represent the same target gene perform in a similar
          manner, we examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct situations: elements
          dispersed over a long single exon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>),
          overlapping oligonucleotides (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6b</NUMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> representing multiple exons of a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6c</NUMEX>). In each case we observed consistent
          oligonucleotide performance.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiling of trophozoites and
          schizonts
          We chose a direct comparison of the trophozoite and
          schizont stages of the 
          P. falciparum asexual
          intraerythrocytic life cycle as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward
          comprehensively profiling all life-cycle stages of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasite</ENAMEX>. The trophozoite and schizont represent two
          distinct developmental stages within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 48-hour</TIMEX>
          plasmodial erythrocytic life cycle. These stages vary
          greatly in morphology, biochemical properties, and
          transcriptional activity (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 37</TIMEX>]). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-trophozoite stage, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18-24 hours</TIMEX> post-invasion,
          contains a highly transcriptionally active nucleus with
          abundant euchromatin. In addition, trophozoites are
          characterized by massive hemoglobin ingestion, intake of
          nutrients from the surrounding medium, increasing
          concentration of cytoplasmic ribosomes and rapid
          formation of organelles. In contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-schizonts</TIMEX>,
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36-42 hours</TIMEX> post-invasion, are characterized by DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-32</NUMEX> copies) and compaction into newly
          formed nuclei. In addition, maturation of merozoite cells
          begins at the schizont stage and is characterized by the
          appearance of merozoite organelles such as the rhoptry
          and dense granules. The several trophozoite- and
          schizont-specific genes identified previously provide an
          excellent source of positive controls for the experiments
          described below.
          For microarray hybridization, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared
          from synchronized 
          in vitro P. falciparum cultures
          representing the trophozoite stage and the schizont stage
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> independent
          hybridizations were carried out; in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, the
          trophozoite-derived cDNA was labeled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy3</ENAMEX> and the
          schizont-derived cDNA with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy5</TIMEX>. In the other three
          hybridizations, the fluorophore assignment was reversed.
          Of the genes assayed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">854</NUMEX> features displayed a
          differential expression greater than twofold (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>):
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">525</TIMEX> showed higher relative transcript abundance in
          trophozoites than in schizonts, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> had greater
          relative transcript abundance in schizonts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX>
          regression ratios were calculated for each possible pair
          of microarray hybridizations using the filtered dataset.
          The correlation between hybridizations with the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy3/Cy5</ENAMEX> assignment was 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.94 ± 0.02</NUMEX>, while correlation
          of hybridizations with the opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy3/Cy5</ENAMEX> order was 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Northern blot hybridizations
          To confirm the microarray results, we examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          genes by northern blot analysis. In the microarray
          hybridization, the expression levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
          selected genes were unchanged (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 2</NUMEX>-fold) while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          additional genes showed a differential expression between
          the trophozoite and schizont stage (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 2</NUMEX>-fold). An
          equal mass of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from both the trophozoite and
          schizont <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> was hybridized with PCR-generated DNA
          probes corresponding to the selected genes. Subsequently,
          each northern blot was stripped and rehybridized with a
          probe specific for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> kD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p41</NUMEX>),
          fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfALDO; PlasmoDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v4.0 ID</ENAMEX>
          PF14_<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0425</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oligo ID M11919</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], as a loading
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. While the relative amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfALDO</ENAMEX> transcript
          differs by more than twofold between trophozoite and
          schizont <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> when equal masses of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> are
          blotted, we found that the relative amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfALDO</ENAMEX> to
          be essentially equivalent when equal masses of poly(A)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA</ENAMEX> were used for the northern blot (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7a</NUMEX>). The
          discrepancy between northern blots with total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +mRNA are probably due to changes in the relative
          amounts of mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA</ENAMEX> during the
          intraerythrocytic life cycle. The poly(A) +northern blot
          measurements agree well with the replicate array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hybridizations, in which PfALDO</ENAMEX> was consistently less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-fold differentially expressed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>). To
          make northern blot measurements comparable to the
          normalized expression array ratios, the ratio between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stages was measured using a phosphoimager and divided
          by the ratio obtained for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">PfALDO</ENAMEX> control in each
          case. The normalized ratios of the radiolabel signal were
          highly consistent with the averaged ratios from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          microarray hybridizations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Biological significance of the gene-expression
          results
          
            Trophozoite genes
            The predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of features with elevated
            expression in the trophozoite stage comprised genes
            encoding various components of the eukaryotic
            translation machinery. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 and 33</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 40S</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">60S ribosomal subunits</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPS</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPL</ENAMEX>), respectively. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologs</ENAMEX> of
            aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> initiation and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elongation</ENAMEX> translation factors were detected among
            trophozoite-specific genes. Several previously
            identified plasmodial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were present in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
            including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asp</ENAMEX>-tRNA synthetase, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plasmodial
            elongation factors (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfEF1A and PfEF2</TIMEX>) and one
            ribosome-releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfRF1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 39</TIMEX>]. Consistent
            with our findings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PfEF-1A</ENAMEX> has been previously shown to
            have peak expression during the trophozoite stage [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> whose functions are
            linked to the process of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> were present
            among the trophozoite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DEAD-box RNA</ENAMEX>
            helicases, including a close homolog of

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX>-like molecules,
            including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
            P. falciparum heat-shock proteins
            such as PfHSP70 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">M19753</NUMEX>) and
            PfHSP86 (accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L34028</NUMEX>), and a homolog of a
            DnaJ-domain-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DNJ1/</ENAMEX>SIS1
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. These data agree with previous studies
            that found a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAD</ENAMEX>-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA helicases</ENAMEX> to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> during the trophozoite stage in 
            P. cynomolgi [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. Along with
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for the translation machinery a number of
            genes involved in various steps of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA synthesis</ENAMEX> and
            processing were located among the 'trophozoite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>',
            including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ORFs</ENAMEX> belonging to various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> splicing factors (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Two
            previously identified plasmodial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
            components were found in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, including the
            largest subunit of 
            P. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">falciparum RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfRNApolIIA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M73770</NUMEX>), and a homolog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNApolK</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 kD</NUMEX>) [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>]. The expression characteristics revealed are also
            consistent with several previous studies that suggested
            that the plasmodial transcription and translation
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">machinery</ENAMEX> is active through the late ring and early
            trophozoite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> before decaying during the late
            schizont stage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 40</TIMEX>].
            Another functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes that encode
            enzymes of cellular biosynthetic pathways was
            distinguished within the trophozoite category. This
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> set includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> enzymes of carbohydrate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ORFs likely to be involved in nucleotide
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> involved in the biosynthetic
            pathways of several amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Several
            well-characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmodial genes</ENAMEX> were identified in
            this metabolic collection, including 
            P. falciparum lactate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfLDH</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">027743</ENAMEX>), enolase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U00152</NUMEX>),
            triose-phosphate isomerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfTPI; L01654</ENAMEX>),
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glucose-6-phosphate isomerase</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfG6PI</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J05544</ENAMEX>),
            hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfHGPRT; X16279</ENAMEX>) and dihydropteroate synthetase
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfDHPS; U07706</ENAMEX>). In addition, a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
            proteolytic enzymes potentially involved in hemoglobin
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX> was detected among the trophozoite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>;
            these include a cysteine protease, falcipain-2
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF251193</NUMEX>), a metalloprotease falcilysine, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF123458</NUMEX>),
            and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of an aspartic protease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
            plasmepsin-2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L10740</NUMEX>). Falcipain-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and plasmepsin</NUMEX>-2
            have been the targets of recent drug discovery research
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44</TIMEX>].
            Overall, the emergent gene clusters suggest that the
            trophozoite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, a central phase of plasmodial
            intraerythrocytic development, is characterized by the
            activation of general cellular growth functions such as
            transcription, translation and hemoglobin degradation
            and biosynthesis of basic metabolites.
          
          
            Schizont genes
            A large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> found in the
            schizont-expressed category correspond to genes
            previously associated with the various steps by which
            newly released merozoites invade new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells. The
            initial step of this process, adhesion of the merozoite
            to the surface of an erythrocyte, is facilitated by
            several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> exposed on the surface of
            the parasite. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, identical or homologous to
            proteins associated with the merozoite surface, were
            present among the schizont-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This group
            included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> merozoite surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (MSP): MSP1
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M19753</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSP4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSP5</TIMEX>, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF033037</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MSP6</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AY007721</NUMEX>).
            Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ORFs
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">containing Duffy</ENAMEX>-like binding domains,
            erythrocyte-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EBA 175</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L07755</NUMEX>), a
            putative erythrocyte-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EBL1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF131999</NUMEX>),
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to be delivered to the surface from
            apical organelles, including apical membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>,
            AMA1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U65407</NUMEX>), and finally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two rhoptry</NUMEX>-associated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">RAP1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U20985</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAP2</ENAMEX>).
            Initial attachment of the merozoite is followed by
            reorientation of the parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> with its apical part
            toward the erythrocyte membrane followed by
            invagination of the membrane. Previous studies
            suggested that both steps are facilitated by the action
            of actomyosin, which requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>].
            Consistent with these findings, we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
            previously associated with this process, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pf-actinI</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M19146</NUMEX>), 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pf-myoA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF255909</NUMEX>), and merozoite
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap protein-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">U14189</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two subtilisin</NUMEX>-like
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteases</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfSUB1 and PfSUB2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AJ132422</NUMEX>)) differentially
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in schizonts. Interestingly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional
            homolog of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfSUB1</ENAMEX> was identified among the schizont
            genes. Moreover, the expression levels of a set of
            plasmodial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> were previously found to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">augmented</ENAMEX> during the late stages of the malarial
            erythrocytic life cycle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Our findings confirm and
            extend this report: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> unique ORFs sharing a high to
            medium level of homology with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylases</ENAMEX> had elevated mRNA levels during the
            schizont <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> previously identified
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> were present in this set: a
            cAMP-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PfPKAc</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF126719</NUMEX>), and a
            plasmodial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase</ENAMEX>, PfPPJ
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF126719</NUMEX>).
            A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of genes with increased
            expression in schizonts encodes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are
            thought to function on the periphery of a newly
            infected erythrocyte at the early stages of asexual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> include: the genes for
            ring-infected erythrocyte surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (RESA)
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">X04572</NUMEX>) and several close <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RESA</ENAMEX> homologs, CLAG9
            (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF055476</NUMEX>) the related gene 
            CLAG3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
            serine-repeat rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (SERA) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. In
            addition to these well-characterized surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schizont-enriched</ENAMEX> set of transcripts contained a
            number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> identical or homologous to proteins
            recognized by antibodies present in plasmodium immune
            sera obtained either from model organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>] or from
            acute and/or convalescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. In summary,
            the schizont stage of plasmodial development featured
            genes predominantly occupied with the process of
            merozoite function as well as the advance synthesis of
            transcripts for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that facilitate parasite
            establishment within the newly infected
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erythrocyte</ENAMEX>.
            Taken together, these results suggest that the
            parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in the trophozoite stage is dedicated to
            cell growth, and the predominant function of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-late schizont stage is maturation of the next
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of merozoites. Of particular interest is the
            large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> within both categories (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trophozoite</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61%</NUMEX> in schizonts) with no putative
            functions assigned. These ORFs have little to no
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to any other known genes and may possibly
            represent highly specialized functions not likely to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> outside this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of parasites.
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this study, we present a 
        P. falciparum ORF-specific microarray
        utilizing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mer oligonucleotides as individual microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. This approach helped to overcome potential
        problems originating from low PCR amplification and allowed
        us to select probes with a high specificity, thereby
        minimizing potential cross-hybridization. Moreover, the
        oligonucleotide-selection algorithm allowed a balanced GC
        content (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 28%</NUMEX>) across the entire microarray set,
        which is significantly higher than the plasmodial genome
        average, which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.4%</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.7%</NUMEX> in coding regions [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>].
        Application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ArrayOligoSelector</ENAMEX> is not restricted
        to the 
        P. falciparum genome, but is broadly
        useful for the automated selection of hybridization probes
        for a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The flexibility of the selection
        parameters controlling stringency of uniqueness,
        self-binding, complexity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-defined filters and GC
        content, allows the selection of oligonucleotides
        appropriate for any genome.
        Evaluation of results from derivative control
        oligonucleotides showed that long oligonucleotides could
        tolerate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> mismatches; however, alteration of the target
        sequence by more then <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> eliminated most of the
        hybridization signal. Therefore, small sequencing errors
        and natural variation among isolates are not likely to
        impact on sensitivity. These performance characteristics
        imply that the array design for this effort can accommodate
        the study of essentially any 
        P. falciparum strain with a high
        degree of specificity.
        At present, the 
        P. falciparum microarray used in this
        study consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 6,000</NUMEX> gene-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> corresponding to the majority of the total coding
        content predicted for the 
        P. falciparum genome. As new sequence
        and improved gene predictions arise, additional elements
        will be added to this evolving platform. Moreover, the
        present oligonucleotide representation could be further
        extended for investigation of several unusual 
        P. falciparum genetic and
        transcriptional phenomena, including antisense mRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] and alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">splicing</ENAMEX> and/or
        transcriptional initiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49, 50</TIMEX>]. This may be achieved
        by designing exon-specific array features, as well as
        antisense oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide collection
        could also be expanded by sequences corresponding to
        intergenic genomic regions. Inclusion of such elements was
        found to be extremely useful for identifying
        protein-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> regions by
        chromatin-immunoprecipitation as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> not detected
        by automated gene-prediction algorithms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX>].
        Within both the trophozoite and schizont categories,
        large numbers of genes belong to functionally related
        processes. These include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding ribosomal subunits</ENAMEX>,
        multiple factors for transcription and translation, enzymes
        of biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, or merozoite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> and invasion machinery. These results are
        consistent with predictions that a large number of
        plasmodial genes undergo strict stage-specific
        transcriptional regulation, and that such (co-)regulation
        is shared among functionally related genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 52</TIMEX>].
        Naturally, a 'fine-resolution' global gene-expression
        profile including the different steps of the plasmodial
        life cycle for multiple divergent strains will be necessary
        to characterize fully the intraerythrocytic life of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasite</ENAMEX>. At present, our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> is analyzing a global
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profile of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48-hour</TIMEX> erythrocytic life
        cycle with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-hour</TIMEX> resolution for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains of 
        P. falciparum. 
        In a number of model <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, high-resolution
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression maps have served as extremely powerful
        tools for discovery and characterization of novel genes as
        well as exploration of multiple cellular functions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. The gene-expression maps typically comprise
        genome-wide expression profiles at a number of different
        stages of cellular development, profiles of multiple
        strains and genetic variants, and global expression
        responses to number of growth perturbations and
        growth-inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Following a similar approach in 
        P. falciparum is most likely to
        provide substantial information about the many ORFs that
        lack functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotation</ENAMEX>. Further understanding of
        cellular physiology of this parasite including basic
        metabolic functions and the intricate interactions between
        the parasite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> immune system will be a
        key step in uncovering new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for antimalarial drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discoveries</ENAMEX> and vaccine development.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microarray</ENAMEX> fabrication
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-bp oligonucleotides were synthesized (Operon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>, CA), resuspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> × <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> to a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 pmol</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/μl</ENAMEX>, and spotted onto
          poly-L-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">lysine</NUMEX>-coated microscopic slides, as previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. All oligo sequences are available at [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Cell cultures
          
          P. falciparum parasite cells (W2
          strain) were cultured as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>] with slight
          modifications: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> suspension of purified human red blood
          cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPMI1640</TIMEX> media supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> AlbumaxI
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GIBCO/Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA), <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 g/l sodium</ENAMEX>
          bicarbonate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> mM hypoxanthine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM HEPES pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">50 μg/I</ENAMEX> gentamycin. Cells were synchronized by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          consecutive sorbitol treatments on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consecutive cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cycles</ENAMEX> (a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> treatments) and harvested at the
          subsequent trophozoite stage (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-24</NUMEX> h post-invasion) and
          schizont <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36-42</NUMEX> h post-invasion). For the
          trophozoite stage collection, visual inspection of the
          Giemsa stains show a nearly pure trophozoite population
          with less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> schizonts. For the schizont stage
          collection, we estimate the amount of ring contamination
