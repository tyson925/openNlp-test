        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein tyrosine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> regulates many
        important cellular functions including signal transduction,
        growth, differentiation, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX> and axon guidance.
        The balance between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine kinase</ENAMEX> and phosphatase
        activity is an integral part of this regulatory mechanism.
        A large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> tyrosine phosphatases have been
        identified, which fall into the broad categories of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-like molecules. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine phosphatases</ENAMEX> (RPTPs) contain an
        extracellular region, a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">transmembrane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> and at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> intracellular catalytic domain. They have been
        subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> classes based on the structure of
        their extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A combination of
        immunoglobulin-like (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>) domains and fibronectin type III
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN-III</ENAMEX>) repeats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ectodomain</ENAMEX> defines the type II
        class of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX>. An additional feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II RPTPs</ENAMEX> is a
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteolytic</ENAMEX> cleavage site within the
        membrane-proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> repeat. Upon cleavage,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular N</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and predominantly intracellular,
        membrane bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are generated, which
        remain non-covalently associated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] A subset of the type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, identified previously as type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB RPTPs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], is
        characterized by the presence of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal MAM
        domain.
        Currently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIB phosphatases</ENAMEX> (PTPŒº, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>-2
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>) have been reported. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hPCP-2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], hPTPŒ∫ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>],
        and hPTPŒº [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX> are located on human chromosomes <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 6</ENAMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>, respectively, and hRPTPœÅ is located on chromosome
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Several additional human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPs</ENAMEX> (PTPœÄ, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTPœà</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hPTP-J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTPRO</ENAMEX>) share very high sequence similarity
        (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX>, and are likely to represent the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unigene</ENAMEX> database,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/unigene</ENAMEX>). There are, in
        addition, several murine homologues of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mPTPŒ∫</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Genbank #NM 008983</NUMEX>), mPTPŒº (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#NM008984</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#AF152556</NUMEX>), mRPTPœÅ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> and mRPTPœÅ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># AF162856/7</NUMEX>),
        mRPTPmam4 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#NM 021464</NUMEX>), mPTPf (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#D88187</NUMEX>) and mPTPŒª
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#U55057</NUMEX>). The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are likely to be murine
        homologues of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hPCP-2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mRPTPmam4</ENAMEX> is the same gene as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> is the most recently isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the IIB
        family [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern blot</ENAMEX> and in situ hybridization
        studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> is largely restricted to the
        central nervous system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, expression is
        developmentally regulated and, in the mouse, delineates a
        unique boundary region in the granule cell layer of the
        cerebellar cortex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Motifs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> extracellular
        segment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domains) are commonly found in
        cell adhesion molecules. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phosphatase domains in the
        intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, like other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, is involved in signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dephosphorylation</ENAMEX>.
        The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ gene</ENAMEX> has been mapped to chromosome
        20q12-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.1</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]; it is located between anchor markers
        D20S99 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D20S96</ENAMEX>, and is flanked by the phospholipase C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma 1</ENAMEX> and splicing factor SRp55-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> gene
        maps to a syntenic region at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> cM on mouse chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, a
        region closely linked to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pltp</ENAMEX> and flanked by the markers,
        D2Mit22 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2Mit52</TIMEX>. To date, only portions of the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been sequenced, however,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> encompassing the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ gene</ENAMEX> has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> in its entirety (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chromosome 20</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanger Centre</ENAMEX>), but it is not, as yet, fully assembled and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> chromosomal region containing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene has been sequenced (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celera Discovery System</ENAMEX>),
        but it is also largely unassembled. In this report, we
        describe the cloning of the mouse cDNA, the identification
        of an unusually long 3' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX>, the identification of
        alternatively spliced exons, and the genomic organization
        of the human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ genes</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          The nucleotide sequence and domain structure of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>
          The nucleotide sequence of hRPTPœÅ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> predicts a
          1463AA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypeptide</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least eight</NUMEX> domains. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX> is comprised of extracellular and
          intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. The extracellular segment
          contains a signal peptide (AA <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1-25</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAM</ENAMEX> (meprin, A5
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">neuropilin</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPmu</ENAMEX>) domain (AA <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32-191</NUMEX>), an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (AA <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">210-266</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> repeats (AA <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">286-369,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">382-471, 483-576</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">593-675</ENAMEX>). A potential proteolytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> site is located at AA <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">632-635</ENAMEX>, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
          fibronectin repeat. The transmembrane segment is located
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX> AA <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">765-785</ENAMEX>. The intracellular region contains a
          juxtamembrane 'wedge' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (AA <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">888-920</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> highly
          conserved phosphatase domains (AA <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1061-1162</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1351-1456</TIMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> hallmark amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that define the
          catalytic core of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phosphatase domain are
          located at AA <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1104-1114</TIMEX>. The stop codon is found after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residue 1463</ENAMEX> of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> genomic organization
          We have determined that the region encompassing human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> is contained within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX> clones and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> clone (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dJ269M15, dJ47A22, dJ753D4, dJ914M10, bA32G22,</ENAMEX>
          dJ232N11, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dJ3E5</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dJ230I19</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dJ81G23</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dJ707K17</TIMEX>, and
          dJ1121H13; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sanger Center</ENAMEX>, chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We have ordered these clones by identifying RPTPœÅ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> within each of them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene spans a minimum
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mbp</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> coding sequence is comprised of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 33</NUMEX> exons, several of which are alternatively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spliced</ENAMEX>. A prominent feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene structure
          is the considerable variability of exon spacing (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exons 1-19</ENAMEX> extend over the initial ‚àº <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> kbp of the
          gene; exons <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-10</ENAMEX> are widely separated, while exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-19</NUMEX>
          are more closely spaced. Of particular note are introns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, which are ‚à<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">º 300 and ‚à</NUMEX>º <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 kbp long</NUMEX>, respectively,
          considerably longer than the next largest intron. In
          contrast, exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-28 and 29-32</NUMEX> form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tight clusters,
          which together span <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 60</TIMEX> kbp. In general,
          this pattern of exon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> appears to be
          characteristic of most RPTPs, as it is also observed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ≥</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ±</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Each of
          these phosphatases has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> very large intron in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-region of the gene. This feature is not restricted
          to receptor-like phosphatases as it is also present in a
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adhesion receptor genes</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>cadherin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-cadherin</ENAMEX>, P-cadherin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CAM</ENAMEX>, deleted in colorectal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (DCC), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">axonin-1</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F11</TIMEX> (discussed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]).
          The exon and intron sizes and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX>/intron junctional
          sequences of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ gene</ENAMEX> are detailed in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. The majority of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' splice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are consensus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. There is some variation in the length of
          exons, which range from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 to 297</TIMEX> bp. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the exons are less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 bp</TIMEX>, while the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> are in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-300 bp</NUMEX> range. Greater
          variation occurs in the size of the introns, which range
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">725 to 303,715 bp</NUMEX>. The largest number of introns
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15</NUMEX>) falls into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 5bp bin, and somewhat fewer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX>) fall into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 3to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4bp bin size. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 5</NUMEX> introns
          lie outside this range: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these fall into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          2to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 3bp range, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unusually long introns in the
          extracellular domain are over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 5bp</TIMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTP</ENAMEX> extracellular segment is comprised of protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>; the borders of these modules correspond to the
          boundaries of exon-clusters. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible
          junctional phases between exons and introns: Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          refers to introns with junctions between the triplet
          codons, whereas phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> introns separate within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triplet</ENAMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> nucleotides,
          respectively. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Ashows</NUMEX> the distribution of intron
          phases relative to the domain structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>. Within
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene, the number of phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> introns
          is comparable at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 12</TIMEX>, respectively. In contrast,
          there are only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> introns in the entire gene. A
          notable feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene structure is that phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> appear to be preferentially associated with the
          extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, where they flank each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domain exon modules</ENAMEX>. The intracellular segment is
          almost devoid of phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> introns. In contrast, phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          introns are primarily associated with the intracellular
          segment, and are only infrequently represented in the
          extracellular region.
          Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX> have been examined in sponges [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>] the phylogenetically oldest extant metazoan. Although
          sponges are multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, they lack the
          cellular cohesiveness of the higher eukaryotes. When
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, sponge and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX> were aligned and
          rooted cladograms constructed, the common early ancestor
          of the phosphatase domains appeared to be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phosphatase domain arose as a duplication of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTP</ENAMEX> extracellular domain was acquired
          during the transition from single-celled to multicellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, the extracellular and intracellular
          exon modules are separated by phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          introns, respectively. Furthermore, intracellular introns
          are much smaller than those in the extracellular segment.
          Together, these observations suggest that the RPTPœÅ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> and intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> originated as
          separate modular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that evolved by exon shuffling
          and duplication, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 15</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> segments
          became linked to form a functional transmembrane molecule
          during the transition from single to multicellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
          Over fifty percent of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is comprised of
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], making it the first repeat-rich
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> to be sequenced. Analysis of these numerous
          segments can provide important indications of the
          evolutionary history of a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>.
          Transposon-derived elements form the largest category of

          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene, the most common of these are: LINE1

          There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> repeat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">intron 7</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.005%</NUMEX>). In
          addition to the transposon-derived repeats, there is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogene</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">intron 7</TIMEX>, a tRNA-derived repeat in intron
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">133 variable length nucleotide</NUMEX> tandem repeats
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">VNTRs/ microsatellites</ENAMEX>) found in the gene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>/C
          content of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 42%</NUMEX>.

          The overall percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene comprised of
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> is lower (by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>) than that of the
          entire human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>. In the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINEs</ENAMEX> comprise
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> of repetitive sequences, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SINEs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX>, and DNA

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> from the normal range is unknown.
        
        
          cDNA cloning and genomic structure of mouse
          RPTPœÅ
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RPTPœÅ cDNA was cloned using a combination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse cDNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genbank</ENAMEX> accession
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#AF152556</NUMEX>) encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1451AA</NUMEX> polypeptide that is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>
          identical to that of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and predicts an
          analogous domain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The Celera
          Discovery System mouse genomic database was used to
          identify clones containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> exons. These clones were
          then ordered and analyzed to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">junctions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> and intron sizes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron junctional
          sequences, and intron phases of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ gene</ENAMEX> are
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>. In general, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron splice
          sites in the mRPTPœÅ correspond to expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GT</ENAMEX>-AG intron
          consensus splicing sequences, and the intron phases in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>) are identical to those in the human gene
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> share approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> nucleotide identity overall, when examined exon by
          exon, the degree of identity varies slightly between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> and intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). The
          overall identity of the mouse and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular</ENAMEX> and
          intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89% and 92%</NUMEX>, respectively. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, there is slightly greater variance between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>; for example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exons 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78% and 95%</NUMEX> identity.
          Within the intracellular segment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>
          identical to that of the human, and exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>, which
          contains the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the catalytic core, is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>
          identical. Notably, the alternatively spliced exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 and 22a</TIMEX> (discussed below) are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97% and 95%</NUMEX>
          identical, respectively, indicating a high degree of
          conservation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human. In summary, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human genes are virtually identical in terms of
          the number and size of exons, and the exons differ only
          slightly with respect to the nucleotide sequence.
        
        
          Exon/intron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> extracellular
          segment
          
            MAM domain
            The relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
            protein domain boundaries is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Aand</NUMEX> in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 6and 7</ENAMEX>. Within the extracellular segment, exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
            encodes the signal peptide, and exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> encode
            the single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal MAM domain, a distinguishing
            feature of all type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIB</ENAMEX> phosphatases. Although the
            function of the RPTPœÅ MAM domain is unclear, other type
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphatases</ENAMEX> have shown homophilic binding
            properties: When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterologously</ENAMEX> expressed in
            non-adherent cells, both RPTPŒº and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫ bind
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homophilically</ENAMEX> to induce the formation of large,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium-independent</ENAMEX> aggregates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. Furthermore,
            when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º MAM domain was deleted, aggregation was
            eliminated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], implying that the domain had a
            crucial role in homophilic cellular interactions.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ MAM</ENAMEX> exons differ widely in size: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">126</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 2</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">272 bp</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 3</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">82 bp</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 4</ENAMEX>). All
            MAM-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">introns</ENAMEX> are in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, with the
            exception of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> internal intron, which is in
            phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> have been identified in a variety
            of cell adhesion molecules. We have determined the exon
            structure of the MAM domain in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> human RPTP IIB
            genes, and in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zonadhesin</ENAMEX> and human
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enteropeptidase</ENAMEX> (NCBI database). The genomic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the MAM domain in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> IIB
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatases</ENAMEX> is identical. In all RPTP IIB proteins
            (Genbank <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#NM 002844</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">002845</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">005704</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NM 007050</NUMEX>)
            and in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zonadhesin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Genbank #AF312032</NUMEX>) there is a
            MAM domain at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX>, the genomic structure of
            which is highly conserved. In zonadhesin, there are two
            additional and adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAM</ENAMEX> domains. The genomic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> differs from
            that of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. The single MAM domain in the human
            enteropeptidase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Genbank #Y19124</NUMEX>) is more
            internally located than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, close to the
            transmembrane region. It is comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> exons
            that are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150, 135, 89 and 125</TIMEX> bp in length, and is
            unlike any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX> and zonadhesin MAM domains. In
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summary</ENAMEX>, all known MAM domains are located within the
            extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>, but within this region, their
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>, exon number and exon size can vary
            considerably. The size and structure of exons
            comprising the most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal MAM domain appear to be
            unique. Because the nucleotide sequence of the RPTPœÅ
            MAM domain predicts a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> similar to that found in
            the other type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB RPTPs</ENAMEX>, it might be expected that the
            RPTPœÅ MAM domain also participates in homophilic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, as was shown for RPTPŒº [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX> domain
            Adjacent to the MAM domain, the single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-like
            domain is split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> similarly sized exons (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> intron in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). Introns
            flanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-like domain are in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In the
            majority of genes encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-like domains, only one
            exon encodes each domain, while in others such as
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CAM</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons encode each domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The single
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-like domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> falls into the latter
            category, suggesting a closer relationship to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CAM-like molecules. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> has characteristics of both
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], a feature which it shares with several
            other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perlecan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
            Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTP IIB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-like domain appears
            to act in conjunction with the MAM domain to bring
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> homophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cell interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domains
            Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX> domain are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> repeats
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>), each of which begins with a highly
            conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proline residue</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domains are found in
            a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and recently, have been shown
            to be involved in retinal axon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> selection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
            As a general rule, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domains are encoded either by
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 exons</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Within genes that encode multiple
            <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domains, exon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> may be of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type,
            or a combination of the two types. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CAM
            has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> exons for each <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], whereas
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tenascin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] have a mixture of both
            types. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> gene, there is a good correlation
            between exon structure and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> boundaries (Figure
            3A), although there is some variation in the number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> per domain: Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> repeats
            is encoded by a single exon (exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 8</NUMEX>,
            respectively). In contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> repeat is
            encoded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two exons</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9 and 10</NUMEX>). Somewhat atypically,
            the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN III</ENAMEX> repeat is encoded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three exons</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>,
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 13</TIMEX>). This domain contains a putative proteolytic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> site. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">RPTPœÅ FN-III</ENAMEX> repeats share high sequence
            similarity with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CAM</ENAMEX>, but only the third
            <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domain in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> is encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons. In
            contrast to the type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIA</ENAMEX> phosphatase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX>, the RPTPœÅ
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> does not contain exons encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
            fibronectin domain; however, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX>, it has a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX>
            domain encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons.
            In the majority of known cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron
            junctions corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domain boundaries
            are in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons encode a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> domain,
            an intron interrupts the coding region in a central,
            relatively non-conserved, part of the domain, and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon/intron</ENAMEX> junction may be in any phase. In the RPTPœÅ
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, introns separating the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> repeats
            are in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; the intron internal to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> repeat
            is in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, and introns internal to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FN-III</ENAMEX> repeat are in phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 0</NUMEX>, respectively.

            Juxtamembrane region
            Following the transmembrane segment (exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>), exons
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-18</NUMEX> encode the juxtamembrane region (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 6and 7</ENAMEX>). This segment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
            similar to the membrane proximal region in the type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
            phosphatase, murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ±</ENAMEX>, for which the crystal
            structure has been determined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. RPTPŒ± exists as a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimer</ENAMEX> in which the catalytic site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> molecule is
            blocked by contact with a 'wedge' from the other.
            Specifically, the 'turn' part of the helix-turn-helix
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> is inserted into the active site, which maintains
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WpD</ENAMEX> loop in the open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. In other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WpD</ENAMEX> loop undergoes a
            conformational shift upon substrate binding, which
            appears to be crucial for catalysis. Thus, it is very
            likely that the dimeric form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ±</ENAMEX> is unable to bind
            tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, rendering it
            catalytically inactive. The negative charge of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adjacent residues</ENAMEX> within a highly conserved sequence in
            the juxtamembrane region appears to be crucial for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 30</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ±</ENAMEX>, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are
            negatively charged aspartates. In type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB RPTPs</ENAMEX>, the
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is changed to an alanine in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º, and to a serine in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ∫ .</ENAMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> residue is
            retained as either a glutamate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º, or
            an aspartate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ∫ .</ENAMEX> These single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> changes
            may indicate a somewhat weaker level of inhibition.
            This is supported by the examination of the crystal
            structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º, which shows that although a wedge
            is formed, catalytic activity is not inhibited by its
            insertion into the active site on the adjacent monomer
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. However, in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, the first residue
            is a glycine, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the large basic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residue</ENAMEX>, glutamine. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> juxtamembrane
            catalytic region is likely to have a different
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX> to that of the other phosphatases and a
            net positive charge, making the regulation of
            phosphatase activity by dimerization-induced wedge
            inhibition unlikely.
          
          
            Phosphatase domains
            Although the extracellular regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-like
            phosphatases are highly variable, the intracellular
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> phosphatase domains appear quite closely
            related. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD45</NUMEX> gene indicates that
            both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine phosphatase</ENAMEX> (PTPase) domains have
            a very similar exon/intron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, which probably
            arose by duplication [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phosphatase domains are encoded by exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19-26</NUMEX>
            and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27-32</NUMEX>, respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The exon structure
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> phosphatase domains, and that of
            homologous domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">005704</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ∫</ENAMEX> (NM
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">002844</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒº</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NM 002845</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] RPTPŒ±
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ≥</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat Esp</ENAMEX>/mOST-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>], are
            compared in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. We have deduced the genomic
            structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>-2 by comparing known
            cDNA sequences with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic</ENAMEX> clones (NCBI). The
            positions of the exon boundaries in the phosphatase
            domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>-2 coincide
            exactly, and correspond well with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatases</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> is somewhat anomalous in that,
            although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron structure of the second
            phosphatase domain is generally similar to that of the
            other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX>, exons in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phosphatase domain are
            fewer in number, but greater in size. The final exon in
            all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encodes the end of the second
            phosphatase domain, the short <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">C-terminus</ENAMEX> and the entire
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region.
            A striking similarity among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is the
            conservation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX>/intron junction <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24/25</NUMEX> in the first
            phosphatase domain. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD45</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ±</ENAMEX>, this
            junction interrupts the highly conserved sequence
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHCSAGV</ENAMEX>, part of the catalytic core of the phosphatase
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]. Although this exon/intron junction in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX> phosphatases corresponds exactly, there is a change
            in the last amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> from a valine to an alanine.
            Interestingly, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron junction is not observed
            at this position in the cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PTP1B</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>],
            an observation that may indicate an early evolutionary
            divergence of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane PTPases
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
            Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron structure of the two
            phosphatase domains was remarkably similar in each of
            the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX> examined, there were variations in exon
            size and number, primarily in those close to the
            transmembrane domain. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> exon (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">135</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nt</ENAMEX>) in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phosphatase domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat Esp</ENAMEX>/mOST-PTP
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ≥</ENAMEX> is replaced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller exons (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 and 98</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nt</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ±</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD45</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒº .</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> replace a single exon at the
            C-terminal end of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phosphatase domain of rat
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Esp/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mOST-PTP</TIMEX>. Similarly, at the start of the second
            phosphatase domain, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> exon (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">174nt</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> is replaced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat Esp</ENAMEX>/mOST-PTP, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ≥</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD45</TIMEX>. In
            each case, the total number of nucleotides in the two
            smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> is virtually identical to that of the
            single larger exon at the same position. It is unclear
            whether these changes in exon number resulted from
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intron</ENAMEX> gain or exon fusion.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' untranslated region
            Following the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phosphatase domain, there is a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.0 kb</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' untranslated sequence. BLAST
            comparisons identified a region on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">KIAA0283</NUMEX> gene
            (Genbank accession <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#AB006621</NUMEX>) that showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> identity
            to nucleotides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3181 to 4437</TIMEX> of the hRPTPœÅ sequence.
            Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-UTR of hRPTPœÅ, which is contained in exon
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>, was identified as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIAA0283</TIMEX>. Polyadenylation signals
            were found at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12425</NUMEX> nt and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12663</NUMEX> nt (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">007050</ENAMEX>).
          
        
        
          Alternative splicing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human RPTPœÅ
          genes
          Comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTP</ENAMEX> type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIB</ENAMEX> (RPTPŒº, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX>) nucleotide sequences predicted that, at
          least, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 and 16</NUMEX>) are likely to be
          alternatively spliced. In addition, the presence of a
          segment (AA <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">826-850</ENAMEX>) in xenopus RPTPœÅ that is absent in
          the majority of other type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB RPTPs</ENAMEX>, raised the
          possibility of an alternatively spliced exon between
          exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 and 18</TIMEX>. Human fetal brain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> neonatal brain,
          and several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (cortex, forebrain, brainstem, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellum</ENAMEX>) of adult <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> mouse brain were examined
          for the presence of alternatively spliced regions. PCR
          primers were designed to amplify the regions
          encapsulating exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 and 16</TIMEX>, and the region between
          exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 and 18</TIMEX>. An additional region between exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> was also examined. The identity of all PCR
          products was verified by sequencing.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> primers yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> products of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 bp</NUMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5Aand 5B</ENAMEX>), indicating a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> nt
          alternatively spliced region at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2177 to 2233</TIMEX> nt. This
          19AA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> is encoded by exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>. Both splice forms
          were observed in human fetal, and in neonatal and adult
          mouse brain mRNA. We have obtained similar results for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RPTPŒº</ENAMEX> (data not shown), in which exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> was reported to
          be absent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NM</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">002845</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> primers yielded
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bands of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">356 and 326</NUMEX> bp (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5Cand 5D</ENAMEX>). This
          indicates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 10</NUMEX> AA alternatively spliced
          region, located between the transmembrane and the first
          phosphatase domain (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2370-2399</TIMEX> nt). Both transcripts were
          present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human brain, and were observed in
          all brain regions analyzed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> product that did not contain the
          exon 16 sequence (data not shown). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> alternatively
          spliced exon (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22a</NUMEX>) was identified in the first
          phosphatase domain between exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 and 23</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">22a</ENAMEX> was
          inserted after nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3172</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, and after
          nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3232</TIMEX> in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>, predicting an additional
          alternatively spliced region <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> AA in length. In each
          case, primers yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bands of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93 and 152</NUMEX> bp (Figure
          5Eand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5F</ENAMEX>) in all brain regions examined. It remains to be
          determined if other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIB</ENAMEX> subfamily
          also contain this exon, or whether the region is unique
          to RPTPœÅ.
          Comparison of xenopus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human type IIB RPTP
          nucleotide sequences indicated the possibility of a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> alternatively spliced region located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3</NUMEX>' to exon
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>, within the wedge domain. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 75</TIMEX> nt segment is
          present in the reported sequence of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>º
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2445-2520</TIMEX> nt) and in xenopus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2448-2523</TIMEX> nt). It is
          absent in the reported sequences of human and mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPŒ</ENAMEX>∫, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP-2</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exon 17/18</NUMEX> primers were
          designed to amplify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential products of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209 and 134</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nt</ENAMEX>. However, only a single product of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX> nt was observed
          in human and mouse brain regions (data not shown). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> appears to be unique to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPŒº</ENAMEX> and xenopus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> and is unlikely to represent an alternatively
          spliced exon in any of the RPTP IIB genes.
          Both splice variants of exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 16 and 22a</TIMEX> were
          present in human and mouse brain, at all ages and in all
          brain regions examined. Although the RPTPœÅ protein
          products encoded by the alternatively spliced exons do
          not appear to encode any known motifs, different isoforms
          of the phosphatase, with as yet unknown functions, are
          likely to be present. Alternatively spliced isoforms of
          the related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPTPŒ≤/Œ∂</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>], are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatially</ENAMEX> and temporally distinct in the central nervous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, and there is evidence that alternatively spliced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exons</ENAMEX> can influence ligand binding, as is the case with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We describe the cloning of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> cDNA, the
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and alternative splicing of the mouse and
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and the presence of an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 kb 3</ENAMEX>'-UTR in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> is the largest RPTP gene characterized to
        date, extending over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1 megabase</NUMEX> pairs of genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Its considerable length is due, primarily, to expanded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> in the extracellular region. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domains of
        the extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> are encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 3</NUMEX> exons,
        which form modules that are flanked by phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> introns. The
        majority of introns in the intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> are in
        phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, and are relatively small. These data suggest that
        the ectodomain and the phosphatase domain arose separately
        by exon shuffling and duplication and fused at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later</TIMEX>
        evolutionary period. The MAM domain, the region
        characterizing type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIB</ENAMEX> phosphatases, possesses a unique
        genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> common to all such domains when located
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> fibronectin repeat in RPTPœÅ
        is encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons, an additional feature found only
        in type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphatases</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> alternatively spliced
        exons flank the transmembrane domain, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> showing
        the greatest variability between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX> phosphatases.
        An additional alternatively spliced exon precedes the
        catalytic core of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phosphatase domain. Comparison
        of the genomic structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative members</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RPTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (types <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I-V</ENAMEX>) indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX>/exon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of both phosphatase domains is highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. There is considerable variation in the length of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPTPs</ENAMEX>; at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> kb, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RPTPœÅ 3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> is the
        longest characterized to date. Our results provide the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> characterization of the genomic structure of an RPTP
        type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIB gene</ENAMEX>. This information will facilitate future
        studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and other regulatory elements
        responsible for the tissue specificity of gene
        expression.

          Cloning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RPTPœÅ cDNA
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> RPTPœÅ cDNA was obtained using a combination
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">RACE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> by methods described in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was isolated (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAzol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tel-Test</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Friendswood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) from
          C57BL<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/6</NUMEX> mouse brain and used to synthesize first strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> (AMV-RT, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Molecular Biochemicals</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>), which was then amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> using
          degenerate primers based on the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> sequence. PCR
          products were analyzed on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> agarose gels and subcloned
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOPO2.1</ENAMEX> vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). Each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> was sequenced at least twice. Sequence analysis
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector NTI Suite</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Informax</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murine RPTPœÅ</ENAMEX> sequences were
          identified by BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] using blastn, on the nr
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX>, with all parameters set to default values. An
          initial 923 nt fragment was obtained, which spanned the
          region from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> thFN-III repeat through the first
          phosphatase domain. Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed using
          new gene specific primers based on the newly isolated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine</ENAMEX> RPTPœÅ sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Genbank #AF152556</NUMEX>), and degenerate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX> based on the hRPTPœÅ sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Genbank #</NUMEX>NM
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">007050</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Alternative splicing
