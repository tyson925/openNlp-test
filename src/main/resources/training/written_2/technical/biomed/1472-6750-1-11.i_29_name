        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapid</ENAMEX>, robust and reversible induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression would significantly facilitate certain
        applications of gene therapy and the study of cancer
        biology. Several inducible systems have been developed to
        regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporal</ENAMEX> and quantitative manner. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] These include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> based on heat shock, heavy metal ion, tetracycline,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">steroid</ENAMEX>, or ecdysone hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">induction</ENAMEX>. For in vivo
        applications, tetracycline, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX>, rapamycin and,
        ecdysone responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have been studied most and in
        recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Currently the most popular inducible system
        is based on components of the tetracycline resistance
        operon, which has seen use in both tumors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5</NUMEX> ] as well
        as transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] However, these systems have
        limitations the most important being the significant
        background expression. Recently, the development of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducible</ENAMEX> system based on the insect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid ecdysone</ENAMEX> and
        the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> that mediates its effect [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] has
        provided an alternative that may circumvent these
        limitations. The use of ecdysone inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>
        expression in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] and in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        has recently been demonstrated. The use of this system in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> has several potential advantages over other regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. The ecdysone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> do not affect mammalian
        physiology like glucocorticoids or progestins and are not
        known to be toxic or teratogenic like tetracycline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        allowing their use in both developmental studies with
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> as well as in the context of gene
        therapy and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor biology</ENAMEX> studies in mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        The popularity of the ecdysone inducible gene switch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> has led us to investigate its characteristics as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> expression in tumor xenografts since
        to our knowledge, this has not yet been reported. Prior to
        evaluating this in vivo, we have thoroughly examined the
        kinetics of this switch in vitro in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different tumor cell
        lines using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> in order to evaluate the
        generality of these observations. The in vivo evaluation
        was carried out in a model of highly aggressive murine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bladder cancer</ENAMEX>, which has previously been used for testing
        various therapeutic interventions. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] These bladder
        cell lines were transfected with a novel ecdysone system
        regulating the expression of firefly luciferase and then
        injected subcutaneously into syngeneic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>. Treatment of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with ecdysone analog
        A/-(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-methoxy-2-ethylbenzoyl</ENAMEX>)-A/'-(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,5</NUMEX>-dimethylbenzoyl)-A/'-tert-butyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrazine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>) was then carried out with subsequent
        evaluation of in vivo gene expression. Our data suggests
        that in vivo induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene expression</ENAMEX> is
        feasible and reversible using an ecdysone switch and opens
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> for the efficient functional characterization of
        many newly discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as well as novel gene therapy
        approaches.

          Derivation of mouse tumor cell lines containing a
          novel gene regulatory mechanism
          A description of the plasmids encoding the two
          components of an ecdysone inducible transcription
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> system was reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGAL4-EcR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pVP16</NUMEX>-mRXR encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimerize</ENAMEX> and regulate transcription upon the
          addition of ecdysone type ligands (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). Using
          these plasmids as a starting point, a novel indicator of
          the inducible gene expression system was constructed as
          follows. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and enhancer were removed from
          the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>).
          Inserted in its place were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> copies of the GAL4
          binding site followed by the minimal promoter region of
          the major late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> from adenovirus (from pG5-luc
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>)) and the coding region for the enhanced green
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (EGFP) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pEGFP-N1</TIMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). The control plasmid, pRL-TK (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>),
          expresses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renilla</ENAMEX> luciferase gene under the control
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSV</ENAMEX> thymidine kinase (TK) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. This plasmid
          provides constitutively high gene expression and we use
          it as an indicator of the number of tumor cells present
          in the tissue samples harvested from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the in vivo
          experiments.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MBT-2 cells</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> urothelial cancer cell line, or
          Panc02, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> ductal adenocarcinoma, were transfected
          by electroporation with a mixture of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> plasmids;
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components of the gene expression system,
          pVP16-mRXR and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGAL4-EcR</ENAMEX>; the indicator and selection
          plasmid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pGAL4-EGFP-SV40-</ENAMEX>neo; and the internal control
          plasmid, pRL-TK. Stably transfected MBT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were
          selected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 Î¼g/ml G418</ENAMEX> and Panc02
          cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">700 Î¼g/ml G418</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> after which there
          were many large cell <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> on each transfection plate.
          The drug resistant cells were harvested by
          trypsinization, pooled, and cloned to single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by
          limiting dilution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well plates. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> had
          grown in a subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 96</TIMEX> well plate,
          fresh media containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> was added to all wells to a
          final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M</NUMEX>. Cells were treated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> and all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> were visualized with the
          fluorescent microscope to detect EGFP expression.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 96</NUMEX> clones of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MBT-2</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Panc02</NUMEX> clones
          demonstrating fluorescence were trypsinized and expanded
          into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> well plates. When the clones had reached at least
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> confluence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 24</TIMEX> well plate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> was again added
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M to verify the earlier observation of induced EGFP
          expression. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> clones of each cell line exhibiting high
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> expression were expanded for further
          analysis. Each cell line was transiently transfected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Î¼g</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pFR-luc</ENAMEX> and carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Luciferase activity in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> was similarly low in all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of the
          triplicates of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> transfections. After treatment
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBT-2</ENAMEX> clonal cell
          lines had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold or lower increase in luciferase
          activity. Clone <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.4</NUMEX>-fold higher luciferase
          activity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> treatment. This clone, designated
          MBT2+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RheoSwitch-2</ENAMEX>, was used for further development. In a
          similar analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Panc02</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RheoSwitch-3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> demonstrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">428</NUMEX>-fold respectively. No
          significant change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renilla</ENAMEX> luciferase activity was
          observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> treatment in all cell lines.
        
        
          Stable introduction of inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> genes
          into the RHeoSwitch tumor cell lines
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBT-2+RHeoSwitch-2</ENAMEX> cell line containing the
          RHeoSwitch expression system was used for the
          introduction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene systems. The
          plasmid, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pG5</NUMEX>-luc, contains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the GAL4</TIMEX> response element
          expressing the luc+ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The vector
          pGAL4-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SEAP</ENAMEX> containing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GAL4</NUMEX> response element and the
          coding region for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, a unique, second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene, was also used. Each of these vectors was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linearized</ENAMEX> and co-transfected with linearized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pSV40</NUMEX>-Zeo
          by electroporation into the MBT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RHeoSwitch-2 cells</ENAMEX>.
          Cells were selected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 Î¼g/ml Zeocin</ENAMEX>
          until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> appeared in each of the plates. Zeocin
          resistant cells were trypsinized, pooled, and single cell
          cloned by limited dilution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well plates. Aliquots of
          the pooled cells used for cloning were also plated in
          triplicate, treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> or DMSO for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hrs.</TIMEX> Assays
          for the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> in each cell pool showed
          induction ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17-fold</NUMEX> for the luciferase
          transfected cells and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-fold</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAP</ENAMEX> transfected
          cells. This verified the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> inducible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reporter genes</ENAMEX> (luciferase or SEAP) in the cloned pool of
          cells.
          Clones were grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zeocin</ENAMEX> containing media until
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> appeared. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> luciferase transfected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">113 SEAP transfected</NUMEX> clones were transferred
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">96</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well plates</ENAMEX> and duplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of each were
          treated with either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Each pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> was assayed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
          protein activity and clones demonstrating basal levels of
          activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO</ENAMEX> treated sample and high levels in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> sample were further expanded for additional
          testing. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> clones were plated in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX>
          plate and triplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M GS-E</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>. Luciferase clone
          MBT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luc-5B3</ENAMEX> was chosen to be used for a
          more detailed analysis of the properties of the gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> system.
          The inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene plasmids, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pG5</NUMEX>-luc and
          pGAL4-SEAP, were transfected into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Panc02</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch-3
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> cells and stable transfectants were isolated as
          they were into the MBT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch cells. Multiple
          Zeocin resistant cell clones from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transfections
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 Panc02</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>+luc, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75 Panc02</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>+luc,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 Panc02</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GAL4</NUMEX>-SEAP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>
          Panc02+RHeoSwitch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAP</ENAMEX>) were plated in duplicate and
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>. A sample of clones with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DMSO</ENAMEX> treated sample and
          the highest level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> treated sample
          were selected to be expanded and further tested.
          Multiple assays in triplicate on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GAL4</NUMEX>-SEAP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfected</ENAMEX> clones gave induction levels ranging from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118- to 551</NUMEX>-fold for the best <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five Panc02</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch-3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52- to 486</NUMEX>-fold for the best twelve
          Panc02+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch-4</ENAMEX> clones. Clones
          Panc02+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RHeoSwitch-3+GAL4-SEAP-5</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-8</NUMEX> and
          Panc02+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RHeoSwitch-4+GAL4-SEAP-8</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-9</NUMEX> were used for
          further characterization. Multiple assays in triplicate
          on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pG5</NUMEX>-luc transfected clones yielded induction
          levels ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32- to 51-fold</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> best
          Panc02+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch-3</ENAMEX> clones and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7- to 94-fold</NUMEX> for the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four best Panc02</TIMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch-4</ENAMEX> clones. Clones
          Panc02+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RHeoSwitch-3+luc-3C1 AND -1B1</ENAMEX> and
          Panc02+RHeoSwitch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>+<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">luc-3A1 and -4B3</TIMEX> were used for
          further characterization. These clones do not exhibit the
          high levels of induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> expression that was seen in
          the initial RHeoSwitch transfected cells. This may be
          explained by the fact that they were selected on the
          basis of the induction level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene
          expression, however, contrary to the initial screen, the
          level of induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> was not used as a selection
          criteria and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> clones in which the expression of GFP
          has variegated were isolated. A summary flowchart of the
          cell line selection and characterization is shown in
          figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Characterization of the novel gene regulatory
          mechanism in vitro
          Treatment of luciferase clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B3</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> consistently induced luciferase levels from near
          background with only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> added, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 150</NUMEX>-fold
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) when adjusted for non specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-Luc induction
          which was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.2</NUMEX> fold. In order to understand
          the induction kinetics of the inducible system, cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBT-2+RHeoSwitch-2</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">luc-5B3</ENAMEX> was treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>
          and cells were harvested at different times to determine
          the time course of gene induction. At each time point,
          the control and treated cells were collected in passive
          lysis buffer and dual luciferase assays performed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          were plotted as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RLU1/RLU2</ENAMEX>)/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RLU1/RLU2</ENAMEX>)
          ratio (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) fold induction over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> time
          point which was set empirically as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This data shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Aindicates</TIMEX> that gene expression is increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and reaches maximum induction by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renilla</ENAMEX> luciferase, increase steadily
          with time, reflecting the increase in cell number, but
          the increase was the same with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GS-E</ENAMEX> treatment
          (raw data not shown but effect accounted for in the
          calculation as defined above).
          The sensitivity of the gene expression system to
          varying doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> was determined by treating
          duplicate samples of clone MBT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+RHeoSwitch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">luc</NUMEX>-5B3
          with varying concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 or 48 hours</TIMEX>
          and dual luciferase assays were performed on the cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysates</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were plotted as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RLU1/RLU2</ENAMEX>)/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">RLU1/RLU2</ENAMEX>) ratio (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          fold induction over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> drug concentration which was
          set empirically as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. These results show an increase in
          gene inducing activity with increasing GS<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-E</ENAMEX>
          concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 10 Î¼M</NUMEX>. A significant increase was
          seen with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 1</NUMEX> Î¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>. No change was seen in
          the level of the internal control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renilla</ENAMEX> luciferase with
          varying concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> (raw data not shown but
          effect accounted for in the calculation as defined
          above).
          The decay characteristics of the induction were also
          studied. After a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> incubation, the medium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containing GS-E</ENAMEX> was removed and the cells washed three
          times with complete medium without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>. The cells were
          then re incubated for various durations. At set intervals
          replicate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> were removed and dual luciferase assays
          were performed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysates</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). This data
          indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> mediated induction is completely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reversible</ENAMEX> and that this occurs within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>.
          Similar dose response and time course of induction of
          gene expression experiments were performed on the Panc02
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch</ENAMEX> and the inducible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reporter genes</ENAMEX>. The time course of gene induction
          demonstrated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> independent
          Panc02+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RHeoSwitch</NUMEX>+luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> clones each showed an
          increase within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> treatment and reached
          the maximum induction by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> independent
          Panc02+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RHeoSwitch</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAP</ENAMEX> clones also induced expression by
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> but the level of SEAP activity continued to
          increase for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX>, possibly due to the accumulation
          of the enzyme in the cell culture media over the entire
          treatment time. Treatment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of these independent
          Panc02+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RHeoSwitch</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene clones with varying doses
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> consistently yielded a significant induction in
          gene expression with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.5</NUMEX>-fold induction over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> treatment alone) and a maximal induction with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80.2</NUMEX>-fold induction over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX>). The dose response
          and time course of induction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Panc02</TIMEX> cells were
          similar to the results seen in experiments on the MBT-2
          cells. These results show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch</ENAMEX> gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> gives consistent results independent of
          the cell type being used, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene used to
          assess the activity, as well as the chromosomal
          integration site of the DNA encoding the RHeoSwitch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> (compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Panc02</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RHeoSwitch-3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-4</NUMEX> described
          above) or the integration site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene DNA
          (compare multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> clones from each of three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch</ENAMEX> clones described above).
        
        
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vivo</TIMEX> results
          The potency and favorable kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> as an
          ecdysone-system inducer in vitro in both the pancreatic
          and bladder cell lines led us to evaluate its performance
          in vivo in a bladder xenograft model. To measure the
          pharmacokinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSE</ENAMEX> mediated gene induction in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, we inoculated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBT-2</ENAMEX> murine bladder cancer
          cell line into syngeneic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and after the tumors
          reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> mm in diameter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,12 and 24 hour</NUMEX> intervals following
          inoculation, the tumors were excised and analyzed for
          luciferase induction. Luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was chosen
          primarily because its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-4 hour</TIMEX> half-life in mammalian
          cell allows precise kinetic studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The renilla
          luciferase was used as an internal control in addition to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">untreated mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Bindicates</TIMEX> that
          induction of luciferase activity in tumor xenografts is
          prompt, peaking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 6-12 hours</TIMEX>. In addition, decay of
          the effect occurs swiftly and baseline expression levels
          are reached by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12-24 hours</TIMEX>. Although available to us, the
          identification of cell specific expression within the
          tumor using the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> in these tumor cells was
          complicated by the decrease in the level of GFP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (data not shown), presumably due to position
          effect variegation of the transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as well as poor
          quantitation ability.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Methods devised to control gene expression must allow
        for rapid, robust, precise, and reversible induction of
        gene activity. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> are small lipophilic
        molecules that penetrate all tissues and are quickly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolized</ENAMEX> and cleared, they appear to be ideal inducers
        for developing gene regulation systems that fulfill these
        criteria. To exploit the pharmacokinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> while
        eluding the potential complications of the use of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammalian hormone</ENAMEX> as the inducer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> laboratory
        developed an inducible system based on the insect steroid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecdysone</ENAMEX> and the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> that mediates its
        effects. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] This system is comprised of a chimeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protein</ENAMEX> composed of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VP16</NUMEX> activation domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vg</ENAMEX>) fused
        to an ecdysone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EcR</ENAMEX>) with altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
        specificity heterodimerizes with the retinoid <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> receptor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXR</ENAMEX>) and binds a unique synthetic response element not
        recognized by natural nuclear hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Upon
        exposure to the ecdysone analog muristerone A (murA), the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VgEcR/RXR</ENAMEX> complex efficiently induces the expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reporter genes</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells and transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch</ENAMEX> gene expression system, the properties of
        the chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have been optimized through the
        analysis of a series of truncation and site-directed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palli, et</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, manuscript in preparation). This
        study demonstrates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> generation system
        in vitro and in vivo and subsequent modified versions of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoSwitch</ENAMEX> will be sensitive to lower concentrations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> and result in higher levels of induced gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHeoGene</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>).
        The popularity of the ecdysone-inducible gene switch led
        to the unexpected rapid depletion of murA stocks, the
        primary inducer used in the system. MurA was isolated in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1970s</TIMEX> from the seeds of kaladana (Ipomoea
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calonyction</ENAMEX>), a plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> to the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] The difficulty in obtaining kaladana
        seeds prompted efforts to seek alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inducers</ENAMEX> derived
        from more common <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> or synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">analogs</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> is one of a family of diacylhydrazines that have been
        found to act as non-steroidal ecdysone mimics that can
        function as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene inducers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        The avalanche of new genes resulting from completion of
        the genome project has accentuated the need to develop
        methods to determine gene function. The requirement for
        tight regulation, easy titration and minimal background
        expression is particularly important in the study of genes
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor suppressors</ENAMEX> or cell cycle regulatory genes
        for which cell lines stably expressing the product can
        rarely be made. In addition, deliberate manipulation of
        gene activity is also an indispensable tool for clinical
        applications such as gene therapy. The strengths of the
        ecdysone-inducible system appear to be its tight
        regulation, its dose responsiveness, and the favorable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> and clearance kinetics of the inducer, which results
        in rapid gene switching. Thus it appears ideal for both the
        in vitro and in vivo study of newly characterized genes in
        their role in tumor formation and progression. In vitro
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> indicates that our constructs when used in combination
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX>, offer an excellent induction profile and rapid
        decay of gene expression when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> is removed from
        in vitro culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, we have demonstrated similar
        kinetics for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different cancer cell lines with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">luc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAP</ENAMEX>) thus validating the generality
        of the observed results. In addition, these constructs are
        also associated with a low baseline gene expression level
        allowing the study of genes whose expression may be
        incompatible with the generation of constitutively
        expressing clones. A recent report showed that the
        expression of nonmuscle myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-B induced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Muristerone A</ENAMEX> in vitro [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] suppressed the subsequent
        tumorigenicity of the implanted cells in vivo.
        The potency and favorable kinetics of the cell lines we
        developed in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> as an ecdysone-system
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducer</ENAMEX> in vitro in both the pancreatic and bladder cell
        lines led us to evaluate the performance of this system in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> in a bladder <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> xenograft model. The advantages of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBT-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">murine bladder tumor model</ENAMEX> are several fold.
        First, it was derived by chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX>, the most
        common known etiologic factor in bladder <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        when inoculated orthotopically it reproduces the biology of
        human muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive bladder cancer</ENAMEX>. Thirdly, it has been
        widely used as a model system of various therapeutic
        interventions in bladder <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interestingly</ENAMEX>,
        our data indicates that the kinetics of induction of tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luciferase</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> mirror those observed with
        transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PonA</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] This finding
        may indicate that despite their use in a malignant context,
        the ecdysone constructs behave with similar kinetics to
        that in normal cells thus implying a general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in
        studies of various histological tumor types. In addition,
        comparison of the in vivo (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>) and in vitro (Figure
        3A) induction curves reveals roughly similar time to peak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> despite the fact that the in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments
        were carried out with a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sesame seed oil</ENAMEX>,
        which purportedly slows its delivery. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        Although available to us, the identification of cell
        specific expression within the tumor using the induction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> in these tumor cells was complicated by the decrease in
        the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> expression, presumably due to position
        effect variegation of the transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. In addition, the
        utility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> for the localization of gene expression in
        vivo, particularly in conditions of hypoxia, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, has been recently been questioned [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Finally,
        quantitative analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> GFP induction is difficult
        and less reliable than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX> such as luciferase.
        Therefore we have limited our in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vivo</ENAMEX> experiments
        determining the general level of gene induction within the
        tumor by using a luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> which has been proven
        to be reliable in vivo.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have used a modified ecdysone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> system which
        has favorable baseline and induction kinetics in response
        to a novel ecdysone analog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> in murine tumors in vitro.
        We have demonstrated the general applicability of this
        system by demonstrating its use in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different mouse
        tumor cell lines, integration of the RHeoSwitch DNA
        components at multiple chromosomal locations, as well as
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> different gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>, luciferase, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEAP</ENAMEX>. We
        have presented data that is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstration of
        tumor cell lines stably transfected with an ecdysone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducible</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constructs</ENAMEX> tested in vivo demonstrating that in
        vivo these constructs coupled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GS-E</ENAMEX> allow rapid and
        robust induction of gene expression in tumor xenografts.
        Finally, due to the rapid decay of gene expression
        following maximal activation, this system can be easily
        titrated for the duration of the induction necessary by
        using slow release formulations such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALZET</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini</ENAMEX> pumps [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . The postgenomic era has accentuated the need to
        develop methods to determine in vivo gene function in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and this ecdysone system may be a useful approach to
        address this.
