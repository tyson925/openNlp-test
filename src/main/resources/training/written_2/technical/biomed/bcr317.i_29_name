        Appropriate clinical treatment of an individual with
        multiple adjacent breast tumors can be difficult to
        determine. If the tumors originated from the same clone,
        then they are likely to have common genetic changes and
        behave in a similar manner. Alternatively, if the tumors
        are separate primary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, then different genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> might have been disrupted and the tumors may
        require separate treatment strategies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Current methods
        to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor clonality</ENAMEX> include methylation-sensitive
        restriction enzyme digestions and detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosome
        polymorphisms, neither of which give an overall genomic
        assessment of tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        We tested the capabilities of oligonucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> in determining tumor clonality. We obtained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from adjacent tumors from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, and
        compared the transcriptional profile of each tumor. For
        comparison, we determined the gene expression profiles of
        tumors with similar clinical characteristics from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. These findings were interpreted in
        the context of the observed chip-to-chip variation and with
        duplicate labeling of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and method
        
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and selection criteria
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> foci of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDC</ENAMEX> were removed from the right breast of
          an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> (tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX>). Neither
          mam-mography, intraoperative palpation, nor histologic
          analysis revealed a physical connection between these
          tumors. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> tumors from separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with the
          same clinical characteristics were also selected as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comparisons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample preparation
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from dissected tumor
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> or greater IDC using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIzol ®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) followed by RNeasy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 μg</NUMEX>) was used
          to synthesize double-stranded cDNA using Superscript
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">®Choice System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>), and the template for
          an 
          in vitro transcription reaction was
          used to synthesize biotin-labeled antisense cRNA
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioArray™ High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit; Enzo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostics, Farmingdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). Labeled cRNA was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmented</ENAMEX>, hybridized, and scanned as described in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix GeneChip ®protocol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix, Inc</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U95A</ENAMEX> arrays contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,500</NUMEX> known human genes
          (see Lipshutz 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Expression profiles were analyzed using GeneChip
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">®Analysis Suite 3.3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix, Inc</ENAMEX>). Only relative
          changes equal to or greater than twofold level of gene
          expression were considered. The average difference values
          obtained for each tumor were plotted in log scale on
          scatter graphs using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip ®.</ENAMEX> The average difference
          values were exported into <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">JMPIN ®3.2.6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX>). Then, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,500</NUMEX> data points were used to generate
          a pairwise (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson's</ENAMEX>) correlation and, after sorting the
          average difference values by magnitude, a ranked
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX>) correlation coefficient for each set of
          sample comparisons was calculated [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Chip-to-chip variation
          In order to measure the variation in gene expression
          between individual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> oligonucleotide arrays, the
          labeled cRNA target prepared from tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX> were
          each hybridized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">U95A</NUMEX> chips. For each
          cRNA sample, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,500</NUMEX> transcripts
          represented on the chip were considered 'present' using
          Affymetrix algorithms.
          The data from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5A</TIMEX> duplicate experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5A</ENAMEX> and
          5ADUP) had a pairwise correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.995</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Fifty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> showed a twofold or greater
          difference in expression between duplicate data sets.
          Likewise, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5B</TIMEX> duplicate experiments (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B and 5BDUP</TIMEX>) had
          a pairwise correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.995</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          genes showing a twofold or greater difference in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). None of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B/5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BDUP</ENAMEX> experiment were
          also differentially expressed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A/5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADUP</ENAMEX> experiment,
          suggesting that these changes represent random
          experimental variation.
        
        
          Variables in sample preparation
          In order to measure the variation in gene expression
          seen when different cRNA targets are prepared from the
          same total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and hybridized to separate U95A
          chips, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> 5A was used to prepare cRNA
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> after the initial preparation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5AsRNA</NUMEX>). Gene
          expression patterns from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5AsRNA</TIMEX> had a pairwise
          correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.915</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> or greater difference in expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A/5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADUP</ENAMEX> experiment were also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed at twofold or greater levels in
          the comparison of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5AsRNA</TIMEX>. Thus, use of the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> source resulted in the additional perturbation of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> over the observed chip-to-chip
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, again most likely representing primarily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> experimental variation.
        
        
          Comparison of adjacent tumor gene expression
          The gene expression profiles from tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX> had
          a pairwise correlation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.987</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> or greater difference in expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          When the expression profiles of cRNA targets from all
          duplicate experiments were compared (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), the
          observed pairwise correlation ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.982 to 0.987</NUMEX>,
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed with twofold or greater
          differences. Thus, the number of differentially expressed
          genes observed when comparing cRNA targets prepared from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tumors 5A</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) was not greater than
          that observed with multiple sample preparations from the
          same total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). In fact, the pairwise
          correlation coefficient of the adjacent tumors (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.987</NUMEX>)
          was higher than those observed with multiple cRNAs from
          the same total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.915</NUMEX>). Therefore, we conclude
          that the gene expression profiles of tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX> are
          so similar that they are indistinguishable by the
          oligonucleotide microar-ray analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">preformed</ENAMEX> here.
          These findings suggest that tumors <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5B</ENAMEX> represent
          multifocal components of the same tumor, despite a lack
          of apparent physical contiguity.
        
        
          Comparison of tumors among different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tumors 5A</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> had a pairwise correlation coefficient
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.787</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1937</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> having a twofold or greater
          difference in expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Likewise, the
          expression profiles of tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 9</TIMEX> generated a
          pairwise correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.745</NUMEX>, with twofold
          or greater differences in the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1764</TIMEX> genes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). As expected from the pairwise correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, the expression patterns based on data from the 5A
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5ADUP</NUMEX> experiments have a closer linear relationship
          on the scatter plot than that observed between tumors 5A
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. Interestingly, tumors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 9</NUMEX> differed by only
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1158</TIMEX> genes with a pairwise correlation coefficient of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.874</NUMEX>, indicating that these tumors may be more similar
          to each other than they are to tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX>.
          In order to confirm our results in a larger sample
          set, we preformed an analysis on an additional set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> breast tumors from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (tumors
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 20</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>) and compared the data with those from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tumor 5A</ENAMEX>, and found similar correlation coefficients to
          those seen with tumors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 9</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Ranked correlation values of samples
          Analysis of the distribution of the average difference
          values of each tumor revealed a skewed distribution (data
          not shown). Therefore, a nonparametric analysis was used
          to examine the complexity of the data. Ranked correlation
          coefficients were generated to match each of the pairwise
          correlation coefficients calculated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). A small
          drop in correlation values (by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.027</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.035</NUMEX>) was observed
          in the ranked correlations compared with the pairwise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlations</ENAMEX> in the duplicate experiments and those that
          compared tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Conversely, in the
          pairwise data sets with lower correlation coefficients
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A/5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AsRNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A/7</NUMEX>i and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A/9</NUMEX>i), the ranked correlation
          calculations increased the correlation values by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.021</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.098</NUMEX>. These data suggest that a simple pairwise
          correlation comparison may not fully represent the
          relationship between gene expression profiles. Further
          analyses of these data distributions and algorithmic
          methods for the evaluation of background and systematic
          error are currently being conducted.
        
        
          Expression patterns for selected genes of known
          interest in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          Differences in gene expression for specific genes that
          are implicated in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinogenesis</ENAMEX> were examined. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>-associated gene list was derived by
          querying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EASI ®Database U95A</ENAMEX>, with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'breast</ENAMEX>' as a search term. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          identified from this search, but only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> of these genes
          were judged present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> tumor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tumors 5A</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX> only differed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
          related gene, the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammaglobin β precursor gene</ENAMEX>, and
          showed no differences in expression for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          genes examined, including hormone response, tumor
          suppressor and mammary specific genes. The human
          mammaglobin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is overexpressed in a variety of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinomas</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. It does not appear to be
          consistently found in a specific subclass of tumors, or
          is its exact function known. Tumor 5A had significantly
          higher levels of expression of the vascular endothelial
          growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> ) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>-fold), the breast
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> ( 
          BA46 ) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>-fold) and the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammaglobin gene</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX>-fold), as compared with tumor
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.
          Tumor 5A had a higher level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> ) expression than did tumor 7
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.7</NUMEX>-fold), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BARD-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>-fold), and thymidylate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthetase</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>-fold). Tumor 5A had higher expressions
          than did tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone receptor</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>-fold), human mammaglobin
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36.9</NUMEX>-fold), and the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammaglobin</ENAMEX> β precursor
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29.1</NUMEX>-fold), but had lower expressions of the androgen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-fold), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BARD-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>-fold) and
          thrombospondin-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-fold). These findings suggest that,
          even though these tumors appear similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, grade
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> status, they in fact exhibit important differences
          in gene expression that may be associated with different
          clinical behaviors.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microarray</ENAMEX> technology has tremendous potential in cancer
        research and diagnostics. The genetic profiles of tumors
        can be assessed and compared in a global manner, thus
        improving diagnosis and potentially allowing
        individualization of treatment strategies. Several studies
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>] have characterized the gene expression patterns
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX>, but the present study is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
        test the sensitivity and capabilities of oligonucleotide
        microarray analysis in determining tumor clonality. The
        expression profiles of adjacent breast tumors from one
        individual, and of tumors with similar diagnostic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> (including grade, stage, and hormone
        status) from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were compared.
        Additional experiments were preformed to measure
        chip-to-chip variation and variation in the probe
        preparation process. All data sets were subjected to both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairwise</ENAMEX> and ranked correlation calculations. These
        analyses suggest that complex data sets, such as those
        derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, may require
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">multiple-</ENAMEX>stage analysis to enhance the ability to detect
        changes optimally and to infer biologic significance from
        expression profiles.
        In the present study, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> difference was observed in
        the expression profiles of duplicate experiments using the
        Affymetrix <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">U95A</NUMEX> chips. When the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was hybridized to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">U95A</NUMEX> chips, the data were found to have a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.915</NUMEX> pairwise correlation. The lower than expected
        correlation coefficient, which was related to sample
        preparation variation, may be due to a small amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>. Future experiments will confirm whether this
        variation in sample preparation is predictable as a
        baseline level. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5AsRNA</NUMEX> expression profile differed from
        that of 5A by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 165</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, which is within the range
        observed in tumor comparisons with a pairwise correlation
        coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.987</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.980</NUMEX>. Additionally, when the
        correlation data were further stratified by rank, the
        correlation coefficients of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5A</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5AsRNA</NUMEX> more closely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resembled</ENAMEX> ranked correlations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5A</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5B</NUMEX> experiments
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Regardless, a small amount of chip-to-chip
        variation and sample preparation variation is to be
        expected when comparing microarray experiments.
        The number of genes that were differentially expressed
        in tumor 5A as compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> 5B (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">149</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>)
        approximates the number of genes that are differentially
        expressed as a result of variations in sample preparation
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). None of the genes that were differentially
        expressed between these adjacent tumors had a known role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> development. These findings lead us to
        conclude that tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX> are essentially
        indistinguishable by microarray analysis, suggesting that
        they are likely to be derived from the same clone.
        Interestingly, little heterogeneity was detected between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tumors 5A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5B</ENAMEX>, despite the fact that both tumors had
        each grown to a size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3</NUMEX> cm.
        In contrast, the expression profiles of tumors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 9</NUMEX>
        showed marked differences from that of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> 5A
        (correlation coefficients of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.787</NUMEX> for tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 7</TIMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.745</NUMEX> for tumors <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5A</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), with the expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>
        (tumors <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5A</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1764</TIMEX> (tumors <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5A</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) genes
        differing by twofold or greater between tumors. These
        findings were confirmed in a larger sample set of three
        additional invasive tumors, providing additional support to
        our findings. It is interesting to note that pairwise
        comparisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> 5A with other invasive tumors had the
        lowest correlations of all pairwise comparisons, indicating
        that tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX> may be phenotypically distinct from
        all the other invasive tumors examined in the present
        study.
        When the gene expression profiles of tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> were compared, a difference in gene expression for
        several genes that are known to be involved in breast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> was observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Most interestingly, the
        expression profiles of the tumors examined closely reflect
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> receptor status, as measured clinically. For
        instance, tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> had a lower level of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> transcript than
        did tumor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>, which was paralleled by a decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
        content. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tumor 9</ENAMEX> had the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> gene expression, as
        well as the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> content. We were not able to detect
        a difference in expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> between tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 7</TIMEX>,
        however, despite the fact that tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> positive (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fmol/mg</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5A</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> negative, possibly representing an
        expression difference below the sensitivity of the
        technology (see below). Lastly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HER2</TIMEX> was measured as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'undetectable'</ENAMEX> in tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> at diagnosis, but was not
        measured in any of the other tumors examined in the present
        study. Therefore, the lack of difference in expression of
        ERBB2 detected in each of these tumors predicts that tumors
        5A, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> were also Her<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-2</ENAMEX> receptor negative.
        Since the initial draft of this report was prepared, it
        was learned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> that the probe set
        corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> on the version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U95A</ENAMEX> chip used in
        the present study was not 'adequately <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>' of
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region DNA of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>, on the
        basis of recent changes to the annotations in the GenBank
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UniGene</ENAMEX> databases. These findings may present an
        explanation as to why the gene expression data for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>
        in this study did not correlate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression
        measurements.
        Finally, transcripts from several genes that are known
        to play a role in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were not detected in any of
        the tumors analyzed, presumably due to low level
        expression. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> include: 
        BRCA1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX> , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        suppressor element, 
        CP1 . Thus, there is an important
        subset of genes that may not be detected using this
        technology because of low transcript levels, or that may
        not be regulated at the transcriptional level.
        In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate the
        potential for oligonucleotide-based microarrays to assess
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor clonality</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor heterogeneity</ENAMEX>. Although it is
        currently not cost-effective to array every tumor sample
        using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> chip, the results of these experiments
        may lead to identification of a set of genetic markers that
        can be used to generate a smaller diagnostic tumor array
        for use in the clinical setting in the near future.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> to remove <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">o'clock and 9 o'clock</TIMEX> positions in her right breast
            (tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX>, respectively). Neither mammography,
            intraoperative palpation, nor histologic analysis
            revealed a physical connection between these tumors. A
            portion of the tumor was used for clinical diagnostic
            purposes and, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s consent, the remainder
            of the tumor was used for research purposes.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> tumors from separate consenting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were
            identified that had the same stage, grade, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
            characteristics as tumors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A and 5B</TIMEX>, based on the
            pathology reports (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The tumors originated from
            a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who underwent a left breast
            excisional biopsy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> (tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) and from a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">year-old woman</ENAMEX> who underwent a right excisional breast
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biopsy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tumor9</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional invasive
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> added to our data analysis originated from
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excisional</ENAMEX> breast biopsies from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53 year-old</TIMEX> woman
            (tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44 year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> (tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>) and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">year-old woman</ENAMEX> (tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Table 1</ENAMEX>). At
            the time of diagnosis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Her-2</ENAMEX> receptor was measured
            as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> positive for tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and found to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in tumor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. The status of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Her-2</ENAMEX> receptor
            was not measured for any of the other tumors used in
            the present study.
          
          
            Tumor handling
            After the gross pathologic diagnosis was completed,
            the remaining portion of each tumor used in the present
            study was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in
            a freezer at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-80°C until</TIMEX> use.
          
          
            Tumor analysis
            In order to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to
            identify regions of the tumor specimen that contained
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> or greater IDC, frozen sections were prepared from
            each of the tumors. The side of the tumor with the
            greatest surface area was designated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'front' of the</ENAMEX>
            tumor, and the opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> was designated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'back'</ENAMEX>.
            A frozen section was made of the front and back of each
            of the tumor, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were stained with
            hema-toxylin and eosin to visualize the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and to
            verify that the cell population content was consistent
            throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>.
