        The nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (NR) family comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        structurally related transcription factors, many of which
        require their cognate ligand for activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRs</ENAMEX> regulate transcription by binding to response elements
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of target genes and acting as scaffolds
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of large coactivator and corepressor
        complexes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> coactivators include the p160s
        (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GRIP1/TIF-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRC-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AIB1/ACTR/pCIP</ENAMEX>). The
        p160s enhance transcription by binding histone
        acetyl-transferases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p300/CBP</ENAMEX> and pCAF [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-transferases</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CARM1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRMT</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] which, in
        turn, enhance transcription by modification of chromatin.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> coactivators include TRAP220 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , which is part
        of a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAP/DRIP/SMCC</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX>) that contacts
        the basal transcription machinery and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGC-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , a cold
        inducible coactivator that binds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SRC-1</ENAMEX> and proteins
        involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> corepressors include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> corepressor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX>) and silencing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of retinoid
        and thyroid responsive transcription (SMRT) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> repress transcription, at least in part, by
        binding to histone de-acetylases (HDACs) either directly or
        indirectly through other corepressor complex components.
        Other known NR corepressors include RIP140 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hairless</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , short heterodimer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> (SHP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , and receptor specific corepressors such as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>) interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins REA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HET-SAFB</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        Generally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> transcriptional activity is dictated by
        the balance between coactivator and corepressor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX>, and one of the most important factors that
        influences this balance is the absence or presence of
        agonist ligands (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] ). Unliganded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NRs</ENAMEX> such
        as thyroid (TRs) and retinoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (RARs) bind
        corepressors, and ligand promotes release of corepressor
        and subsequent binding of coactivators. The mechanism of
        this coregulator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is well understood. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRs</ENAMEX> consist
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain (which contains a
        context-specific activation function <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AF-1</ENAMEX>), the central DNA
        binding domain (DBD) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal ligand binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (LBD), which contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-dependent activation
        function, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AF-2</ENAMEX>. The unliganded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBD</ENAMEX> recognizes hydrophobic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, termed interaction domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX>), which are
        reiterated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and twice in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> and
        conform to the consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L/IXXIIXXXL</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] (see also [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        ). By contrast, the liganded LBD binds shorter hydrophobic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> termed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> boxes that are reiterated several times
        within each coactivator and conform to the consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXXLL</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBD</ENAMEX> utilizes a large hydrophobic cleft composed of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">H3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H5</ENAMEX> to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , and a smaller
        hydrophobic cleft that is composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the upper
        part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H3 and H5 and H12</TIMEX> (and corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AF-2</ENAMEX>) to bind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> boxes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Thus, agonists promote coregulator
        exchange by promoting the packing of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">H12</NUMEX> over the lower
        part of the ID binding region, an event that simultaneously
        completes the coactivator binding surface. In other cases,
        however, the balance of coactivator and corepressor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX> is regulated by direct competition for the AF-2
        surface, rather than ligand-dependent coregulator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>.
        RIP140, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hairless</ENAMEX> and DAX possess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> boxes that interact
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 13 19</NUMEX> ] and these corepressors act as
        negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of the activity of the liganded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX>)
        that conform to the typical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domain NR structure and
        share extensive sequence homology in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBD</ENAMEX> region
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Analysis of the function of the individual ERs
        in mouse knockout models suggests that the major
        proliferative effects of estrogen are mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> and
        not by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX>, which seems to play an inhibitory role in
        proliferation in some studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . The
        ligand-binding properties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> are different, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> often exhibiting stronger binding to plant-derived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phytoestrogens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . More importantly, the ERs exhibit
        isoform-specific effects on gene expression. Both ERs
        enhance transcription from genes with classical estrogen
        response elements (EREs), but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> requires less ligand to
        obtain maximal activation than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . Likewise,
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> suppress the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNFα</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in
        response to estrogens, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> is a more potent repressor
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . However, some of the most striking
        isoform-specific differences in gene regulation are
        observed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>, such as that of cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX>, which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contain AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or related cyclic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> response elements
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREs</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ERα</ENAMEX> enhances <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity in response to
        estrogens, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity in
        response to estrogens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> also completely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppresses</ENAMEX> ERα activity at the cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">D1 promoter</ENAMEX> and even
        suppresses the activity of an ERα mutant that is
        selectively superactive at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
        Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> shows a unique capacity to enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        activity in response to selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulators</ENAMEX> (SERMs) such as raloxifene, tamoxifen and ICI
        182,780/Faslodex (ICI) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . Together, these
        observations suggest that there are fundamental differences
        in the way that the ERs bind unspecified cofactors that
        modulate gene expression, and that some of these cofactors
        must play a role in differential <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> activity at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        sites.
        Although the poorly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTD</ENAMEX> region clearly plays
        an important role in isoform-specificity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] , it is
        also likely that there are differences in the better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved LBD</ENAMEX> region that contribute to differential ERα
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> activities. Phage display techniques have revealed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> show different preferences in LXXLL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] ). Moreover, some cofactors
        that contain LXXLL motifs show differential binding to LBDs
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> isoforms (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHP</ENAMEX> binds ERα
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , and represses ERα activity more
        strongly than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGC-1</ENAMEX> related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> PERC
        also binds ERα preferentially, and potentiates ERα activity
        more strongly than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . We recently
        observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-terminal NR</ENAMEX> interacting
        regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX> but not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogens</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . In this study, we report that ERβ
        interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> are promoted by agonists
        and inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX>. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX> show completely
        opposite ligand preferences of interaction with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corepressors</ENAMEX>. We discuss the potential significance of
        these different modes of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in terms
        of known isoform-specific behaviors.

          To investigate ERβ interactions with corepressors, we
          examined the interactions of full length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>

          in vitro (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Breveals,
          surprisingly, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> and in the presence of agonist ligands (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DES</ENAMEX>)
          and phytoestrogens (genistein, coumestrol). Moreover,
          these interactions were suppressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICI</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">raloxifene</ENAMEX> and tamoxifen). ERβ bound to the coactivator
          GRIP1 more strongly than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX>, but did so with an
          identical ligand preference. Similar agonist-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> could be observed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alternate NR</ENAMEX> corepressor SMRT 
          in vitro (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> binding
          experiments performed in parallel confirmed that ERα
          bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX>, and not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estradiol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D) and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRβ</ENAMEX> bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, and was released in the presence of

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1E).
          To examine interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in
          mammalian cells we performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">assays</ENAMEX> using a
          GAL4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBD/N-CoR C-terminus</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> as bait and a
          VP16-ERβ LBD fusion as the prey. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2shows that the
          ERβ-LBD bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the presence of agonists and
          phytoestrogens, but not SERMs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid assays
          confirmed that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">VP16</NUMEX>-TRβ LBD fusion protein bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CoR
          in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, but not in the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T3</TIMEX>.
          E2 dependent binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> was dose dependent
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B) with an EC50 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3 nM</NUMEX>) that resembled that of
          ERβ binding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GRIP1</NUMEX> NR box <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">610-770</ENAMEX>). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal NR
          interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in the presence of agonists, but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX>, and does so 
          in vitro and in mammalian cells.
          Moreover, results from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">assay</ENAMEX> indicate that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ LBD</ENAMEX> is sufficient to obtain estrogen-dependent

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ Interactions</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> are Dependent on AF-2

          3A). A peptide overlapping to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ID1</ENAMEX> motif (amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acids 2265-2291</ENAMEX>) that competes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> binding to

          agonist-dependent ERβ interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX>. By
          contrast, a peptide corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">GRIP1 NR box 2</ENAMEX> did
          compete for this interaction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . This finding
          suggests that agonist-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> does not recognize ID
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> more closely
          resemble those with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRIP1</TIMEX>.
          NR interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> are usually mediated by a

          left its interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRIP1</TIMEX> either
          slightly reduced or intact (these are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L301R</TIMEX> at the base
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V361R</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-bends</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M379R</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H8</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L426R</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T434R</TIMEX> in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H10 and Y488S</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H11-H12</TIMEX> loop). Thus, ERβ
          interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> are dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-2</ENAMEX> surface
          (including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H12</ENAMEX>) and, in this regard, resemble those of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRIP1</TIMEX>.

          C-terminus
          To map the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> that interacted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX>,
          we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> binding to a series of rationally
          designed smaller fragments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR C-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> did not bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these smaller fragments of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944-2033</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2230-2322</TIMEX>) that contain known ID motifs
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ). ERβ bound weakly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2033-2123</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2123-2230</TIMEX>), one of which (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2033-2123</TIMEX>)
          contains an ID motif (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ID2</NUMEX>), but did so in a
          ligand-independent fashion. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> did bind to a
          fragment that spanned the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2322-2453</TIMEX>)
          and did so in a manner that was promoted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E2</TIMEX> and
          suppressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICI</ENAMEX>, much like the interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> with
          the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">N-CoR</ENAMEX> nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> interacting region.
          The interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> with the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragment</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2322-2453</TIMEX>) was stronger than that
          observed with the intact <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944-2453</TIMEX>). This apparently improved binding is likely to
          be a consequence of our methodology (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . Unpublished data). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, expression of large fragments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CoR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E. Coli</ENAMEX> yields a mix of full length protein
          along with truncated products. To create the expression
          vectors for the smaller fragments, truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CoR
          polypeptides that were obtained in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. Coli extracts</ENAMEX> were
          subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence analysis and cDNA fragments
          that coded for the major truncated products were
          prepared. Each of the resulting polypeptides was
          expressed very efficiently in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. Coli</ENAMEX>. The end product
          that was obtained after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> purification essentially
          consisted of a single short polypeptide as judged by
          Coomassie stain. Binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2322-2453</TIMEX>) is
          probably very efficient for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. First, equal
          amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were used as baits for the
          translated ERβ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in this series of experiments (3μg
          per assay). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2322-2453</TIMEX>) is present in molar
          excess over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944-2453</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, as developed
          above, preparations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944-2453</TIMEX>) generally
          contain truncated products, so sequences corresponding to
          the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR C-terminus</ENAMEX> (which binds ERβ) is
          markedly under-represented. In any case, the fact that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> binds weakly or not at all to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR ID</ENAMEX>
          motifs that mediate interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARs</ENAMEX> and,
          instead, binds in an agonist-dependent fashion to a
          region in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus of N-CoR</ENAMEX> that has not previously
          been implicated in NR interactions indicates that ERβ
          recognizes a novel protein sequence motif within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR C-terminus</ENAMEX> contains the sequence PLTIRMLS
          (β-box, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2399-2406</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This sequence
          does not exactly conform to the LXXLL consensus, but
          contains features (underlined) that resemble the ERβ H12
          region (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L LE</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> ), and artificial ERβ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interacting LXXLL</ENAMEX> peptides (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">293,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P NLIS</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LLS</ENAMEX> ; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D47</TIMEX>, 
          PL LLS 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LLS</ENAMEX> ), both of which bind to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-2</ENAMEX> surface [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45 46 47</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, the
          presence of a proline residue amino-terminal to the
          hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is typical of so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">class II</ENAMEX> LXXLL
          motifs which are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> interacting cofactors such
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TRAP220</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RIP140</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Finally, the unusual
          C-terminal hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> (ML) has been observed in ERα
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H12</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 48</NUMEX> ] , and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RIP140</TIMEX> NR boxes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          .
          We investigated the significance of the β-box in ERβ
          interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6Ashows, a synthetic
          β-box peptide competed for binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX>, albeit
          somewhat less efficiently than native GRIP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> box 2.
          Similar results were obtained in competition experiments
          that used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GST-GRIP1</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST-N-CoR</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). The isolated β-box also acted as bait for a
          VP16-ERβ fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in mammalian cells, and did so
          with similar efficiency to other known ERβ interacting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B). Finally, mutations within the β-box
          (especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M2405A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L2406A</TIMEX>) disrupted ERβ interactions
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX>, but did not
          affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRβ</ENAMEX> interactions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C). Thus, the β-box is
          sufficient to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> and is essential for
          agonist-dependent ERβ interactions with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CoR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>.
          Next, we examined whether the β-box would bind other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gal</ENAMEX>-β-box fusion failed to recruit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX>, TRβ
          or RARβ LBDs in mammalian <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A).
          Moreover, while the β-box and GRIP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> box <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> peptides
          both competed for ERβ interactions with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GRIP1</TIMEX>, only the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">NR box 2</ENAMEX> peptide competed for ERα interactions with GRIP1
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B). Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> β-box is, at least to some
          degree, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> specific. Mutation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> to obtain a β-box
          sequence that more closely resembled a conventional LXXLL
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T2402L</NUMEX>) led to enhanced hormone-dependent
          interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> and permitted novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone-dependent interactions</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C). Thus,
          some of the observed ERβ specificity is probably a
          consequence of an unexpected ability to tolerate the
          absence of a leucine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of the
          LXXLL motif. Together, our results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> has
          the potential to utilize its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-2</ENAMEX> surface to bind NR
          boxes within coactivators or an NR box-like sequence in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus of N-CoR</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAC Repressor Enhances ERβ</ENAMEX> Activity
          Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> in the presence of
          estrogens, we investigated the possible involvement of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corepressors</ENAMEX> in the actions of agonist-bound ERβ 
          in vivo . To perform this
          experiment, we examined the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDAC</ENAMEX> inhibitor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">trichostatin A</ENAMEX> (TSA) on ERβ activity in transiently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transfected HeLa</ENAMEX> cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Aconfirms that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> shows
          stronger transcriptional activity than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> at a simple
          ERE responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene. TSA enhanced the basal
          activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERE-TK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene by about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX>-fold in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> (see inset). However,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> also equalized the relative transcriptional activity
          of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8Bshows that the isolated ERα LBD
          exhibited more potent transcriptional activity than the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ERβ LBD</ENAMEX>. However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBDs</ENAMEX> showed similar
          transcriptional activity in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX>. Thus,
          corepressor complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDACs</ENAMEX> must play an unspecified role
          in restricting the transcriptional activity of both ERβ
          and, in particular, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ-LBD</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with
          the notion that corepressors restrict the activity of
          agonist-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ-LBD</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRs</ENAMEX> generally interact with the corepressors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> either in the absence of ligand, or in the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, and agonists promote corepressor
        release [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In this study, we demonstrated that ERβ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> agonists such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estradiol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DES</ENAMEX> and the phytoestrogens genistein and
        coumestrol, but not in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX>. Moreover,
        this interaction is dependent upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF-2</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H12</ENAMEX>,
        and is competed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box peptides</ENAMEX> but not ID peptides. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hormone-dependent</ENAMEX> component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ /N-CoR</ENAMEX> interaction
        maps to the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX>, which has not been
        previously implicated in NR interactions, and requires a
        sequence that resembles an ERβ-specific NR box (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLTIRMLS</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">β-box</ENAMEX>). In this regard, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERβ</ENAMEX> differs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX>, which
        probably binds ID motifs in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERM</ENAMEX>-dependent fashion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ] and shows reduced binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estradiol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> also differs from many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRs</ENAMEX>,
        which either bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the absence of ligand and are
        released in the presence of ligand or interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CoR
        in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> but not agonists [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        The fact that the mode of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CoR
        resembles that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRs</ENAMEX> with coactivators [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , or with
        corepressors that modulate the activity of liganded NR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RIP140</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , raises the possibility
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> may be able to recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> to
        estrogen-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in response to agonists and
        that the balance of overall ERβ activity in the presence of
        estrogens may be regulated by competition between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p160s</TIMEX> and
        corepressors for the same ERβ AF-2 surface. We recognize
        that our studies do not directly address this issue. Our
        attempts to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> mutants that differentiate between
        GRIP1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> binding to analyze the role of
        agonist-dependent corepressor binding have not yet been
        successful (probably because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> utilizes the same surface
        to bind both cofactors). Moreover, transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> or
        various mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> derivatives did not significantly
        affect ERβ activity at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EREs</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        We do not understand why, but in our hands, transfected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> also fails to affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TR</ENAMEX> or ERα activity (data not
        shown), despite the fact that it clearly interacts with
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRs</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, we suspect that estrogen-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> binding may represent an important component of the
        regulation of ERβ activity. As described in the
        Introduction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> must interact differentially with
        factors that modulate <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> activity in the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogens</ENAMEX>. The finding that estrogens suppress <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-CoR
        binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , but promote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> binding to ERβ
        represents the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstration of a corepressor that
        shows completely distinct modes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>-dependent
        interaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> isoforms. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> and
        their associated HDACs are excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to explain
        some of the differential behaviors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> isoforms.
        Consistent with this notion, the apparent weak
        transcriptional activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ LBD</ENAMEX> is a consequence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corepressor</ENAMEX> HDAC activity at some level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX>
        verification of the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> interaction with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> will await demonstration that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> recruits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> to estrogen-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo , and that this event is
        related to modulation of estrogen response.
        While the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX> have contrasting effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        activity in the presence of estrogens, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> truncations that
        lack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> both enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity in the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERMs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . Mutational analysis of ERα
        action at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 sites suggests these effects may be related
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , and we have proposed that SERM
        action at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may therefore involve contacts with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corepressors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 51</NUMEX> ] . The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> show
        completely different ligand preferences of interaction with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> suggests that the target for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERM</ENAMEX> activation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1
        sites may not be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in both cases. Thus, this finding
        complicates our attempts to explain this unusual
        phenomenon. Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> isoforms enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 activity
        by superficially similar mechanisms that involve different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cofactors</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> action at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 sites
        could, in fact, be mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERM-dependent</ENAMEX> contacts with
        a common cofactor that is, as yet, unidentified. This
        common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> may yet prove to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> if ERβ interactions
        with the β-box were somehow masked 
        in vivo .
        What features of the β-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">box</ENAMEX> contribute to ERβ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, the β-box contains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proline</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal serine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that extend the
        homology of this region to an artificial ERβ-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . However, the β-box also lacks the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> of the consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXXLL</ENAMEX>. A mutation (PL 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T IRML</ENAMEX>>PL 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L IRML</ENAMEX>) that restores the LXXLL
        consensus increases ERβ binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> and permits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERα</ENAMEX> to
        bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> in the presence of estrogens in mammalian
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX>. Thus, the unusual sequence of the β-box
        contributes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> specificity and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> can tolerate the
        absence of a conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal leucine in LXXLL motifs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> might bind to yet more cofactors that contain variant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NR</ENAMEX> boxes that resemble the β-box. Other aspects of ERβ
        interactions with corepressors warrant further study. It
        will be interesting to understand whether the weaker ERβ
        interactions with other regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> (which are
        insensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICI</ENAMEX>) play a role in ERβ binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRT</ENAMEX> also binds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERβ</ENAMEX> in the presence of estrogens,
        but we have not explored the structural features that
        promote this interaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SMRT</ENAMEX> contains
        a sequence insertion at the position of the hydrophobic
        pair in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR</ENAMEX> β-box, which apparently leads to deletion
        of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR/RMLS>SMRT/RLqagvmaS</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] .
        Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SMRT</ENAMEX> contains a different NR interacting motif or
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-CoR NR</ENAMEX> box sequence may be more complex than we have
        initially reported here.
