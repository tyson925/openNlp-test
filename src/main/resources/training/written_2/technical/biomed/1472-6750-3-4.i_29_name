        Recombinant viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> have become the primary agents
        for both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo gene transfer applications [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Viruses are powerful gene transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>,
        since they have evolved specific, efficient machinery to
        deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> into cells. To our knowledge, viral
        vectors have almost always been used free in solution. For 
        in vitro systems, a solution
        containing free viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> is applied to target cells.
        Similarly, free viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> are administered
        locally or systemically for 
        in vivo gene transfer applications.
        Some site-specificity of the delivery of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> can
        be achieved by applying a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> containing viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> specifically to the site of interest for both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo settings. However, such
        site-specificity is seriously limited since viral vectors
        can diffuse freely in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> after application.
        In this work, we have developed a novel strategy for
        virus-mediated 
        in situ transduction of target cells
        on solid surfaces using adenoviral vectors as gene transfer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. In this strategy, adenoviral particles are
        immobilized, tightly and stably, on solid surfaces, while
        maintaining the natural properties of the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX>. We
        reasoned that such immobilized viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> could infect
        cells only at the contact site between the solid surface
        and cells. Thus, the ultimate spatial arrangements of
        transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on the solid surface could be controlled
        and determined, at will, by the strategic placement of
        viral vectors on the solid surface.

          Virus-mediated in situtransduction of cells on
          solid surfaces
          We have developed a novel strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>-mediated 
          in situ transduction of target
          cells on solid surfaces using adenoviral vectors as gene
          transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. In this strategy, adenoviral particles
          are immobilized, tightly and stably, on solid surfaces
          (virus-coated solid surfaces), while maintaining their
          natural properties, including infectivity. We
          hypothesized that such viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX>, immobilized on a
          solid surface, could infect cells only at the contact
          site between the solid surface and cells. This could
          allow the spatial control and arrangements of
          transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on a solid surface, which can be
          determined by the strategic placement of viral particles
          on the solid surface.
        
        
          Infectivity of biotinylated adenoviral vectors
          immobilized on solid surfaces
          The feasibility of this strategy was tested by using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> adenoviral vectors carrying a transducable 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lac Z (Î²</ENAMEX>-galactosidase) gene
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qbiogene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>). The
          extremely tight interaction between the protein
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">strept</NUMEX>)avidin and its ligand biotin ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d ~ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -14M) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] was chosen
          as a means of tethering viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> to the solid
          surface. We previously showed that biotin moieties can be
          attached covalently to the outer surface of adenoviral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> without appreciable effect on their infectivity
          under carefully controlled biotinylation conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . Such biotinylated viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> could be
          attached, specifically and stably, to a solid surface on
          which (strept)avidin is covalently immobilized (avidin-
          or streptavidin-coated solid surface).
          Biotinylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was performed by using
          sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce Chemical</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>), a
          biotin derivative containing an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> -hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS)
          that reacts with primary amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was
          treated at varying concentrations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 - 100 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) of
          sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>),
          followed by the removal of non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">virion</NUMEX>-associated
          biotinylation reagent by ultrafiltration. The
          infectivities of the resulting adenoviral vectors were
          analyzed by using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cells [canine osteosarcoma cell
          line; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX> (ATCC), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manassas</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>] (highly permissive to adenoviral infection) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] as
          targets. Little effect on viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infectivity</ENAMEX> was seen when
          the adenoviral vectors were treated with
          sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin at concentrations up to approximately
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">40 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This is in agreement with our
          earlier study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          These biotinylated adenoviral vectors were analyzed
          for their ability to infect cells when immobilized on
          streptavidin-coated solid surfaces. Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was
          treated with varying concentrations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0 - 30 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) of
          sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, and non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">virion</NUMEX>-associated
          biotinylation reagent was removed by repeated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultrafiltration</ENAMEX>. The resulting biotinylated adenoviral
          vectors were incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h with gentle
          shaking in polystyrene <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, on which streptavidin is
          covalently immobilized (well diameter, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.64</NUMEX> cm;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reacti-Bind Streptavidin Coated Polystyrene Strip Plates</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce Chemical</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Ã— 10 6viral particles</NUMEX> per well). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wells</ENAMEX> were washed to remove unbound viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX>, and
          D-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cells were placed directly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 Ã— 10</ENAMEX>
          3cells per well) and cultured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX>, followed
          by the analysis of the expression of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lac Z</ENAMEX> gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). When
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin at a
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.6 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml or lower, almost no infection
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cells was seen. In contrast, substantial numbers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cells were transduced when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was
          treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 - 30 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. The
          maximum infectivity was seen with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> that had
          been treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, where the
          infectivity was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 75%</NUMEX> of that of unmodified
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> used free in solution. These results suggest
          that, upon biotinylation of the viral surface under
          controlled conditions, adenoviral vectors can be
          immobilized on a solid surface by using the
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">strept</NUMEX>)avidin-biotin interaction, and that such
          immobilized adenoviral vectors are capable of infecting
          cells, 
          in situ , on the solid surface.
        
        
          Efficiency of immobilization of biotinylated
          adenoviral vectors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>, which had been treated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">15 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin followed by the removal of
          unreacted biotinylated reagent, was used to determine the
          immobilization efficiency of biotinylated adenoviral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> in streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. Known numbers of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.CMV-LacZ particles were incubated in
          streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> for immobilization, and the
          number of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> remaining unbound in the
          solution was estimated from their infectivity on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). Despite the extremely tight
          streptavidin-biotin interaction, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 15 - 40%</NUMEX> of
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> were bound to the surface of
          streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> under the conditions used where
          the number of viral particles applied was considerably
          below saturation of the well surface (estimated by both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimensional</ENAMEX> and biotin-binding capacities of each well).
          This result is in contrast with our previous study, which
          showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 95%</NUMEX> of biotinylated
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>, prepared under the same conditions, can be
          readily captured on streptavidin-coated microbeads [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
          . Thus, the relatively low immobilization efficiency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> on the surface of
          streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> is not attributable to the
          absence of accessible biotin moieties on the surfaces of
          a fraction of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> or the presence of
          unreacted biotinylation reagent in the biotinylated
          Ad5.CMV-LacZ preparations. We hypothesized that the
          reduction of the immobilization efficiency is caused by
          physical or fluidic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>,
          in which viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> may have a limited ability to
          migrate. To test this, a constant number of fresh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was applied to the same
          streptavidin-coated well repeatedly (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> per well per addition), with the removal of
          unbound viral particles between the additions. The
          efficiency of immobilization at each addition cycle was
          determined from the number of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> remaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unbound</ENAMEX> in the solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). A relatively constant
          number of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> was bound to the well surface
          at each addition cycle of biotinylated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>. This
          means that the total number of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> that were
          immobilized on the well surface increased roughly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proportionally</ENAMEX> to the number of the addition cycle of
          biotinylated adenoviral particles. This result suggests
          that the relatively low efficiency of immobilization of
          biotinylated adenoviral vectors is caused by their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluidic</ENAMEX> properties in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, which allow only a fraction
          of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> to reach the well surface and be
          captured by streptavidin molecules on the well
          surface.
        
        
          Infectivity of immobilized adenoviral
          vectors
          The efficiency of 
          in situ transduction by adenoviral
          vectors, immobilized on streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, was
          investigated. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Varying</ENAMEX> numbers of biotinylated
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Ã— 10 5- 2.5 Ã— 10 8viral particles</NUMEX> per
          well) were added to streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> (well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.64 cm</NUMEX>) for immobilization, followed by the
          removal of unbound viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX>. D-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cells were
          placed in these virus-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 Ã— 10 2cells</NUMEX> per
          well) and cultured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Then</ENAMEX>, the infection
          of the cells was analyzed through the expression of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lac Z</ENAMEX> gene. For comparison, the
          same numbers of unmodified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> were used free in
          solution. The amount of infection increased with the
          increase in the number of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> that were added
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> at the immobilization step (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          However, the amount of infection plateaued when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          7viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">particles</ENAMEX> were added to the well. Thus, when this
          number or greater of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> was added to the
          well at the immobilization step, all of the cells that
          had been applied onto the virus-coated solid surface were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduced</ENAMEX>. When unmodified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was used free in
          solution, the saturation of infection was seen at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          6viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> per well. Up to this number of viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> per well, used for immobilization for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> or for transduction by free
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> in solution, immobilized adenoviral vectors
          showed lower infectivity than free viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX>.
          However, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2above, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 15 - 40%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.CMV-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LacZ</ENAMEX> applied can actually be
          immobilized on streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. Thus, if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infectivity</ENAMEX> is compared using the actual number of viral
          particles present in each well, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>, immobilized
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">streptavidin</NUMEX>-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, may possess an infectivity
          equivalent to that of free adenoviral vectors.
          We next investigated how the infection of target cells
          by immobilized adenoviral vectors on the solid surface is
          affected by the natural permissivity of target cells for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenoviral</ENAMEX> infection, determined by using free adenoviral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> in solution. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Varying</ENAMEX> numbers of biotinylated
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>, prepared by treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml
          sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, were applied to streptavidin-coated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wells</ENAMEX> (well diameter, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.64 cm</NUMEX>) for immobilization,
          followed by the removal of unbound viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX>.
          Target cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 Ã— 10</ENAMEX> 3per well) were cultured directly on
          the virus-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX>, followed by the
          detection of the expression of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lac Z</ENAMEX> gene. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unmodified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.CMV-LacZ
          were used free in solution for comparison. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines
          were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. One cell line is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>, which is
          highly permissive to adenoviral infection when viral
          vectors are used free in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The other cell
          line is C6 (rat glioma cells), which is less permissive
          to adenoviral infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . For <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cells, the
          amount of infection increased steeply when the number of
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> added to each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Ã—
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 5to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 6</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A) for both immobilized and free
          adenoviral vectors, although free <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Ad5</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> showed
          higher infectivity than immobilized adenoviral vectors.
          This result is consistent with that shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. For
          C6 cells, no appreciable infection was seen with free
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> even when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 7viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">particles</ENAMEX> were
          used per well (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). In contrast, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C6</NUMEX> cells were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> directly on streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, on which
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> had been immobilized, considerable amounts
          of infection were seen when <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Ã— 10 6viral particles</NUMEX> per
          well and greater were added to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> at the
          immobilization step. This result suggests the possibility
          that adenoviral vectors, which are immobilized on a solid
          surface, can infect target cells that are otherwise
          poorly permissive to infection by free adenoviral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX>. Provided that this notion is correct, this
          enhanced infectivity of immobilized adenoviral vectors
          for poorly permissive target cells might be derived from
          the fact that target cells are forced to make direct
          contact with adenoviral vectors on the solid surface,
          raising the local concentration of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> on the
          cell surface. Thus, unlike the infection of cells by free
          adenoviral vectors, the collision of viral particles with
          the cell surface and the amount of the primary receptor
          for adenoviral vectors (coxsackie-adenovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAR</ENAMEX>) on target cells might not serve as the primary
          determinants for the permissivity of the cells. However,
          this enhanced infectivity of immobilized adenoviral
          vectors was not seen with all the cell lines tested that
          are poorly permissive to adenoviral infection. For
          example, the infectivity of immobilized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was
          analyzed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> human colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> cell lines,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HT-29</ENAMEX> (ATCC) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COLO205</TIMEX> (ATCC), which are highly
          resistant to adenoviral infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . HT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          expresses only a small amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">CAR</ENAMEX> on the cell surface.
          Adenoviral particles can be taken up relatively
          efficiently by this cell line, but this does not result
          in transduction of cells. Thus, the expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transgenes</ENAMEX> is extremely poor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAR</ENAMEX> on the surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COLO205 cells</ENAMEX> is even lower than
          HT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> cells, and such CAR expression can be seen on only
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">COLO205</NUMEX> cells. Similar to HT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> cells, the
          transduction efficiency of adenoviral vectors for COLO205
          is extremely poor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The very low transduction
          efficiency of COLO205 by adenoviral vectors, used free in
          solution, was confirmed in our previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          When <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 2.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 7viral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">particles</ENAMEX> were added to each
          well at the immobilization step (or for transduction by
          free <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Ad5</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>), the infectivity of immobilized
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was only slightly higher than free
          Ad5.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> (data not shown). This might
          imply that the binding of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAR</ENAMEX> is still
          required for the 
          in situ infection of target cells
          on solid surfaces by immobilized adenoviral vectors.
        
        
          Adenoviral vector spots on solid surfaces
          Successful 
          in situ infection of target cells
          by adenoviral vectors on a solid surface, shown above,
          suggests that this technology could be used to control,
          spatially, the location of gene transduction on a solid
          surface by strategic placement of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX>. There
          are several possible ways of immobilizing viral vectors
          at predetermined locations on the solid surface by using
          the (strept)avidin-biotin interaction. We used one such
          method to fabricate solid surfaces with adenoviral
          vectors immobilized as discrete spots with predetermined
          sizes. In this method, biotin moieties were initially
          attached covalently to discrete regions on a solid
          surface. To the biotin moieties on the solid surface,
          biotinylated adenoviral vectors were attached by using
          avidin as a molecular bridge between the biotin moieties
          on the solid surface and the viral surface. Cell culture
          plates, which are coated with poly- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-lysine (well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> cm; Biocoat Poly- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-Lysine Cellware <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-Well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plates; Becton Dickinson Labware</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bedford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>), were used
          as the solid surface. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was used to
          attach biotin moieties, covalently, to the primary amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of poly- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-lysine on the solid surface. During the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylation</ENAMEX> reaction, plastic rings (inner diameter,
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.4 cm</NUMEX>) and agarose were used to delimit the regions of
          biotinylation on the solid surface and to protect the
          remaining areas from biotinylation, respectively. After
          unreacted biotinylation reagent was removed, excess
          Neutralite avidin (a deglycosylated, neutralized form of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avidin; Southern Biotechnology Associates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL</ENAMEX>)
          was added, which should bind to biotin moieties on the
          solid surface. After the removal of unbound Neutralite
          avidin, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ad5</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX>, which had been biotinylated by
          treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin as above, was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> and allowed to bind to unoccupied
          biotin-binding sites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neutralite</ENAMEX> avidin that had been
          bound to biotin moieties on the solid surface. D-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cells
          were applied to the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 Ã— 10 5cells</NUMEX> per
          well) and cultured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX>, followed by the
          detection of the expression of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">lac Z</ENAMEX> gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Specific
          transduction of target cells is seen only at the
          locations (spots) where biotin moieties were initially
          attached. This demonstrates regio-specific 
          in situ transduction of target
          cells by adenoviral vectors at predetermined locations.
          Very limited numbers of infected cells were present
          outside the biotinylation areas, indicating that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biotinylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ad5</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV-LacZ</ENAMEX> was bound specifically to
          biotin moieties on the well surface via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neutralite</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avidin</ENAMEX>. This result reveals that the ultimate spatial
          arrangements of transduced cells on a solid surface can
          be controlled and predetermined at the time of the
          fabrication of the solid surface, during which time viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> can be attached to desired locations in any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shapes</ENAMEX>, patterns, and sizes.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We previously reported a strategy similar to the one
        described in this study. In this strategy, biotinylated
        adenoviral vectors are immobilized on the surfaces of
        streptavidin-coated microbeads with diameters up to a few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . For such adenovirus-microbead
        conjugates, great enhancement in transduction efficiency
        was seen with several different cell lines, including
        COLO205, the infection efficiency of which was not notably
        enhanced by adenoviral vectors immobilized on
        streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> in the present study. The primary
        difference between the two strategies is derived from the
        size of solid surfaces (streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> and
        streptavidin-coated microbeads) relative to target cells.
        The sizes of adenovirus-microbead conjugates are smaller
        than those of target cells. Thus, the entire
        adenovirus-microbead conjugates can be taken up by cells.
        Such internalization events appear to contribute
        substantially to the infectivity enhancement by
        virus-microbead conjugates. In contrast, the dissociation
        of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> from the solid surface must occur for
        adenoviral vectors, which are initially immobilized on
        streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, to be taken up by target cells.
        This may be one possible explanation of why infectivity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enhancement</ENAMEX> was seen with adenovirus-microbead conjugates
        and was not with adenoviral vectors immobilized on
        streptavidin-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, except for one cell line
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C6</NUMEX>).
        Virus-coated solid surfaces should offer a variety of
        both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo applications. One such 
        in vitro application would be the
        creation of virus arrays for expression and functional
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . A recombinant viral vector
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, each clone of which carries a different gene,
        could be immobilized in an ordered manner as discrete spots
        on a solid surface. Onto the resulting virus array, target
        cells are applied and cultured. This should result in the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoded genes</ENAMEX> in target cells in an array
        format, in which each encoded gene should be expressed in a
        discrete cell spot while maintaining the original location
        of the viral vector spot in the virus array. Thus,
        expression and functional analysis of many different genes
        can potentially be performed with a single virus array for
        a given target cell line. The use of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> should
        offer enhanced efficiencies and versatility for the
        expression of cloned genes in various cell types than
        approaches using expression plasmids that are printed on
        solid surfaces [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . This might be particularly true
        to primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, which often show poor expression of
        encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> when plasmid-based expression vectors are
        used. The availability of such viral vector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>,
        particularly those based on adenoviral vectors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] ,
        should facilitate the realization of such applications.
        Virus-coated solid surfaces could also be used for 
        in vitro tissue engineering
        applications, for which the shapes and sizes of
        areas/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of genetically engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> can be
        predetermined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-dimensionally by strategic placement and
        patterning of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> on solid surfaces, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exemplified</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Such precise control of the shapes
        and sizes of areas/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of genetically engineered cells
        would be very difficult to achieve with free viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX>,
        which can diffuse freely in solution.
        Virus-coated solid surfaces could also be used 
        in vivo for highly site-specific
        delivery of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> to target tissues or cells
        through the direct application of virus-coated solid
        surfaces to target sites. The delivery of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> in
        a solid-surface-associated form should eliminate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> site,
        minimizing uncontrolled transduction of non-target tissues.
        For example, a virus-coated solid surface, the size of
        which has been adjusted to the intended transduction site,
        could be transplanted into a target tissue, allowing the
        specific transduction of the target site by immobilized
        viral vectors with minimal infection of surrounding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. As proposed for 
        in vitro applications described
        above, the primary advantage for such 
        in vivo gene transfer applications
        would be that the shapes and sizes of areas/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of
        transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can be predetermined by strategic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placement</ENAMEX> and patterning of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> on solid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surfaces</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have devised a method of immobilizing adenoviral
        vectors, tightly and stably, on solid surfaces using the
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">strept</NUMEX>)avidin-biotin interaction, while maintaining their
        ability to infect cells. Such immobilized viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> can
        infect target cells, 
        in situ , on solid surfaces with
        efficiencies equivalent to the same viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> used free
        in solution for the cell lines tested. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cell line
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C6</NUMEX>), the infection efficiency by immobilized viral vectors
        was greater than the same viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vectors</ENAMEX> used free in
        solution, which showed a limited ability to infect the
        target cells. This strategy should be very useful for the
        development of a variety of both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo applications, including the
        creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-based expression arrays for proteomics and
        drug discovery and highly site-specific delivery of
        transgenes for gene therapy and tissue engineering.

          Target cells
          The following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for

          and C6 (rat glioma cells), both of which were obtained
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATCC</ENAMEX>. These cell lines were grown at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> in a

          Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierce Chemical</ENAMEX>) was dissolved in

          For the infectivity analysis of biotinylated
