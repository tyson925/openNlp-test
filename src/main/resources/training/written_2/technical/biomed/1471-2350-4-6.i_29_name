        Sickle cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX>) results from homozygosity for
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ†’T</ENAMEX> substitution at codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the Î²-globin gene
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGâ†’GTG</ENAMEX>) leading to a glutamic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to valine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gluâ†’Val</ENAMEX>)
        substitution in the Î² globin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of human adult
        hemoglobin. Despite this common genetic background,
        phenotypic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sickle cell disease</ENAMEX> is widely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX>, ranging from a mild, asymptomatic course with
        survival into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventh decade</TIMEX> to a very severe
        course with multi-organ damage and early mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Some of the genetic factors contributing to this phenotypic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diversity</ENAMEX> (particularly those linked to the globin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e. Î±</ENAMEX>-thalassemia and Î²-globin gene cluster haplotypes)
        have been well recognized [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stroke</ENAMEX> is a devastating complication of sickle cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, which occurs in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX> of
        age as shown by the multi-center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative Study of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sickle Cell Disease</ENAMEX> (CSSCD) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . In sickle cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years of age</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> is predominantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemic</ENAMEX> and results from the involvement of medium sized
        to large intracranial arteries. Ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is considered a multi-genic disorder [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . In many cases it results from multiple gene-gene and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-environment interactions. In the case of sickle cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, only a few genetic factors are known to influence
        the stroke risk [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . For example, Î±-thalassemia is the
        only well characterized protective genetic factor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Thus, genetic factors that lead to the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX>
        are not well understood.
        Studies conducted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical College of Georgia</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCG</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980</TIMEX>'s have shown that transcranial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doppler</ENAMEX> (TCD) can identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at high risk for stroke
        by detecting high flow rate in major intracranial arteries
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> with flow velocities of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 cm/sec</ENAMEX> or
        higher in middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cerebral</ENAMEX> or internal carotid arteries
        (normal = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">140-170 cm/sec</ENAMEX> for sickle cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>) had a
        stroke risk of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-15%</NUMEX> per year, which represents a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-fold
        increase over that for unselected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with sickle cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. These observations then led to the multicenter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia</ENAMEX>) study
        in which sickle cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2-16 years</TIMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, were screened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
        . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thirty patients</ENAMEX> with flow velocities of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>200 cm/sec</ENAMEX> were randomized to observation or to receive
        periodic blood transfusions to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">% Hb S</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><30</NUMEX>. The
        study was stopped early by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Monitoring</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> due to the finding of a significant reduction in the
        number of strokes (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> reduction, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>) in the
        transfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> strokes in the observation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> vs. one
        in the transfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX> study
        established that transfusion was an effective means of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">primary stroke</ENAMEX> prevention in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with sickle cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> at risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX>. The
        recently funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP-II</ENAMEX> study, to be conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, will investigate the duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> risk and
        the feasibility of discontinuing transfusion after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose TCD velocities have normalized
        after transfusion.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX> study showed that ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 2-16 years</TIMEX> are at risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transcranial Doppler</ENAMEX> (TCD)
        velocities of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 cm/sec</ENAMEX> or greater [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . TCD velocity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevation</ENAMEX> can be due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> factors: reduction of arterial
        diameter due to stenosis and/or increased volume flow
        through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sickle cell disease</ENAMEX>,
        both factors are often present. Velocity elevation
        corresponding to increased cerebral blood flow in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> has been noted, with an approximate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> increase in velocity for decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hb</ENAMEX> or HCT [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
        ] . There are also data to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX>
        have higher flow velocities than those with normal Hb A at
        comparable levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, suggesting the amount and
        composition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb</ENAMEX> are both involved in the velocity
        elevation of sickle cell disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        While some of the risk factors leading to the
        development of cerebral vasculopathy and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in sickle
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (low hematocrit, elevated white blood cell
        count, normal complement of Î±-globin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) have been
        identified in previous studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSSCD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCG</ENAMEX> cohort, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX>), many remain unknown. The observation has been made
        that strokes in sickle cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> are clustered in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, but no clear epidemiological confirmation of this
        has been published. In terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> velocities, it was
        noted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX> study that sibling pairs were common
        among abnormals (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TCD > 200 cm/sec</ENAMEX>) and there were
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> pairs among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suggesting that other
        genetic factors may in part determine propensity for stroke
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RJ Adams</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations).
        Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the
        "hypercoagulable state" observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with sickle
        cell disease. These include increased platelet activation,
        increased thrombin generation, and more recently, elevated
        levels of circulating tissue factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Over the past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>, mutations in a number of genes have been identified
        as the cause of thrombophilia in a large number of patients
        from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> around the globe. The molecular
        basis of inherited thrombophilia now includes mutations in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V</ENAMEX>, prothrombin,
        methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and several
        others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , in addition to those encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such
        as antithrombin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> C, and protein S whose role in the
        homeostasis between procoagulant and anticoagulant
        activities in the circulation is well established. Unlike
        rare mutations involving antithrombin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>,
        which are clearly associated with a hypercoagulable
        phenotype, mutations we propose to study appear to have two
        distinct features: i) they occur with a significantly
        higher frequency in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) they seem to
        contribute to a thrombophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the presence of
        additional acquired (environmental/nutritional) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inherited</ENAMEX> (interaction with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) factors.
        It is likely that the co-inheritance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of
        these mutations in sickle cell disease would tip the
        balance toward a hypercoagulable state and act as an
        additional risk factor for the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX>. Additionally, the effect of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermolabile</ENAMEX> MTHFR mutation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">677</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Câ†’T</ENAMEX>) on plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homocysteine</ENAMEX> levels in heterozygotes has been shown to
        depend upon the availability of folate, with higher levels
        seen in folate deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. It is possible that
        increased folate requirements due to chronic hemolysis in
        sickle cell disease would lead to a relative deficiency
        state, which, in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTHFR</ENAMEX> mutation, would
        result in higher homocysteine levels as an additional risk
        factor for vasculopathy.
        Thus, we propose to study polymorphisms in genes
        involved in a number of systems and pathways related to
        stroke risk [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] : genes associated with coagulation
        factors and thrombophilia (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prothrombin</ENAMEX>,
        Fibrinogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor VII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Factor XIII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PAI-1</ENAMEX>, Thrombomodulin
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTHFR</ENAMEX>), as well as polymorphisms in genes that
        are involved in vascular reactivity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX>), platelet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">activation/</ENAMEX>function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GpIIb/IIIa</ENAMEX>, GpIb <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>-V, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GpIa/IIa</ENAMEX>),
        endothelial cell function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTHFR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-Selectin</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-Selectin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P-Selectin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>), inflammation (TNFÎ±),
        lipid metabolism (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apo E</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-Selectin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L-Selectin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P-Selectin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>).
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes will make it possible to study not
        only polymorphisms associated with a hypercoagulable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
        but also to study the genes involved in pathways that may
        lead to the development of vasculopathy (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
        endothelial cell function, inflammation, and adhesion,
        platelet activation and responsiveness). Thus, this will
        provide the rationale for studying potential genetic risk
        factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of an
        "intermediate phenotype," such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vasculopathy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] rather
        than a thrombotic endpoint (i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> remains the
        only proven indicator of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> and stroke
        risk in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a large case-control association
        study of the role of genes in the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> and stroke risk based upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX>, is
        likely to provide more accurate information and may resolve
        the controversial results obtained in smaller studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ]
        . Furthermore, an attempt will be made to perform a subset
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who go on to have an ischemic stroke
        during the study period in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with
        genetic polymorphisms. As of the termination of the study
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomized in STOP have
        been adjudicated to have a stroke.
        In summary, we have designed a case-control association
        study to elucidate the role of genetic polymorphisms as
        risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX>, measured by a
        high TCD velocity, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX>. The study will
        consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts, a candidate gene study and a
        genomewide screen and will be performed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> cases and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> controls. Cases will include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomized in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX> study (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TCD â‰¥ 200 cm/</ENAMEX>s) as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        found to have high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">STOP II</ENAMEX> screening. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four hundred</NUMEX>
        sickle cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a normal TCD velocity (TCD <
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cm</ENAMEX>/s) will be used as controls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene
        study will involve the analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> genetic polymorphisms
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). References for the

        additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The genomewide screen for a large number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> markers may uncover the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of novel
        polymorphisms with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in
        sickle cell disease. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> will be pooled in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX>
        cases and in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> controls and these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> will be
        genotyped for a large number of validated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> (we estimate
        to need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> markers) using high-throughput
        methods. Purpose of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to give a detailed

          in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 US and 1 Canadian</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> is

          confounding variables between cases and controls will be
          explored by adjusting for these covariates in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, for example through using conditional logistic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> models.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> Genotyping
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> will be extracted from peripheral blood
          mononuclear cells and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> from each

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candidate genes</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> markers in the genomewide
          screen will be genotyped by high-throughput SNP screening
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MassARRAYâ„¢ System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequenom Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>,
          CA). The principles of this method are detailed in
          references [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 300</NUMEX>
          bp fragments of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> site in
          the middle, will be amplified by automated PCR procedure.
          Multiplexing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions will be used as
          determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sequenom</ENAMEX> software. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
          amplification primers includes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' biotin tag, which is
          targeted in a streptavidin-magnetic bead purification
          step to generate a single stranded template for the
          primer extension reaction. An extension primer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complimentary</ENAMEX> to the template at a region directly
          adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> site is added to the single stranded
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX>. This is followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">MassEXTENDâ„¢</ENAMEX> reaction
          during which the primer is extended across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> site
          by using a sequencing polymerase reaction. This is
          controlled by a mixture of dideoxy and deoxy nucleotide
          triphosphates, the ratio of which varies depending upon
          the assay design protocol obtained from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SpectroDESIGNERâ„¢</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sequenom</ENAMEX>). The primer
          extension products will differ depending upon the
          polymorphic base present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> site. The difference
          in molecular weight between these products is detectable
          by mass spectrometry. Following the extension reaction,
          the original sample template is separated and removed
          from the extended primers by the use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX>. The
          purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are then transferred onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpectroCHIPâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          (from either a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX> well plate) with the
          SpectroJETâ„¢ dispenser. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHIP</ENAMEX> is placed into the mass
          spectrometer, which takes advantage of the MALDI-TOF
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption</ENAMEX>/Ionization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time-of-Flight</ENAMEX>) mass spectrometry. The mixture of the
          test molecules (extension products) with the organic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> produces a crystalline dispersion. The matrix is
          hit with a pulse from a laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX>. The sample and matrix
          are vaporized and the primer extension products are
          expelled into the flight tube. As the primer extension
          products are negatively charged when an electrical field
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pulse</ENAMEX> is subsequently applied, they are launched down the
          flight tube toward the detector. The time between
          application of the electrical field pulse and collision
          of the primer extension products with the detector is
          known as "time-of-flight" and is a very precise measure
          of the product's molecular weight. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpectroTYPERâ„</ENAMEX>¢
          software gathers the time-of-flight information and
          applies algorithms to provide accurate, automated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotype</ENAMEX> calling. This method is fast and more accurate
          compared to hybridization-based methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> detection
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . The whole process is automated.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Management</ENAMEX>
          Web-based data entry will be used to load the data
          from this study into the password-protected STOP II
          database at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Research Institutes</ENAMEX> (NERI). A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> entry screen specific to this study will be
          developed for this purpose. Adding the data to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STOP</ENAMEX>
          II database will greatly facilitate linking the
          genotyping data to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> characteristics (e.g.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> status) during data analysis. The database was
          developed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NERI</ENAMEX>'s browser-based data management
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADEPT</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORACLE relational</ENAMEX> database engine.
          As part of standard QC, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the records will be
          randomly selected at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NERI</ENAMEX> for double data entry. Any
          problems with high error rates will be brought to the
          attention of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> immediately. If
          necessary, further records entered by the same individual
          will also be reviewed.
        
        
          Statistical analysis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene
          study
          As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the analysis, the genotypic
          frequencies for each gene will be tested for departure
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> equilibrium. Statistically
          significant departures could indicate biased sampling or
          they could indicate that the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is
          experiencing detectably strong natural selection at that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>.
          The null hypothesis to be tested for each gene is that
          the genotypic frequencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with normal and
          high TCD are the same. This will be tested using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> test of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TCD</ENAMEX> status and genotype
          for each gene. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterozygotes</ENAMEX> will be pooled with
          homozygous mutants to form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> tables (mutant
          present/absent <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">vs. TCD</ENAMEX> status). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test will
          be used instead of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> tests if the frequency of a
          given allele is too low to justify the assumptions of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> test. Rejection of the null hypothesis of no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between genotype and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> status will lead to
          the conclusion that the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> alleles is different in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with normal and
          high TCD. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> correction for multiple testing
          will not be used because correcting for tests at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> loci
          would produce an extremely small critical p-value. In the
          absence of such a correction, the results of this study
          will need to be considered with caution and replication
          of significant findings in an independent sample or
          follow-up study will be important.
          A multivariate approach will then be employed to
          determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TCD</ENAMEX> status varies with combinations of
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; i.e. to determine if the probability
          that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with mutant alleles for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more genes
          is a case (i.e. has high TCD) differs from the
          probability that is predicted from the independent
          effects of those genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loglinear</ENAMEX> models will be employed
          for this [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Suppose, for example, that the data
          from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TCD</ENAMEX> status to form a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Ã—
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Ã— 2</ENAMEX> table. Rejection of the null hypothesis of no
          three-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> in the table would lead to the
          conclusion that the proportion with high TCD depends upon
          the joint effects of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> rather than on their
          separate effects. The cell frequencies in the table would
          then be inspected to determine which combinations of
          alleles accounted for the statistically significant
          results; i.e. to identify the combinations that occur
          with elevated frequency in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop</ENAMEX>
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] provide methods for calculating standard
          errors for the cell frequencies for this inspection.
          Generally, statistical tests of three-way and higher
          order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> are less powerful than tests of
          two-way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> in the same table. More specific
          statements regarding power are difficult without explicit
          statements regarding the magnitude of interaction to be
          detected and there is very little information available
          on which to base the latter. Therefore, the analysis of
          individual genes should be considered the primary
          analysis in this study. Interactions involving more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> variables are generally very difficult to
          interpret. Therefore, the analysis will be limited to
          tables involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Even
          that restriction is unlikely to be sufficient, given the
          large number of tables involving either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX>
          genes that could be formed from the data. Therefore,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multivariate</ENAMEX> modeling will begin with any genes that were
          statistically significantly related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> status when
          the data for each gene were analyzed separately.
        
        
          Power estimates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene study
          In the calculations below, heterogyzotes are pooled
          with homozygous mutants to reduce each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (mutant present or absent). The power to detect a
          difference in genotypic frequencies between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> was determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Carlo simulation</ENAMEX>. The
          simulations were based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> assumptions: (i) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
          alleles are involved in the comparison for a given gene;
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> equilibrium;
          and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) genotypes will be obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> cases and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> controls. The simulations proceeded as follows.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Specify the proportion of homozygous mutants in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> (p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for cases and p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for controls). The proportions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homozygous</ENAMEX> wild type and heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the i
          thpopulation are then (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - p</ENAMEX> 
          i <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX>) 2and 2p 
          i 1/2(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - p</ENAMEX> 
          i <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX>) respectively.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Draw random samples of size <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230 and 400</NUMEX> from the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multinomial populations</ENAMEX> defined above. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Pool</ENAMEX> the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> and homozygous mutants to reduce each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (mutant present/absent).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Compare the genotypic frequencies in the two
          samples using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Repeat steps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5,000</NUMEX> times for each combination
          of p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Estimate statistical power as the
          percentage of simulations in which the null hypothesis
          was rejected.
          Results are presented in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>. On the assumption
          that the goal of the study is to identify mutant alleles
          that occur with increased frequency in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX>, the table is limited to cases in which p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> > p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . To save space, the table is
          further limited to entries that just span the range of
          differences, p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , that can be detected with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80-90%</NUMEX>
          power for each specified value of p 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . Based on these power analyses we
          conclude that we have good power to detect realistic
          differences in frequencies of alleles that increase risk
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in cases as
          compared to controls.
        
        
          Design of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA pooling</ENAMEX> for genomewide association
          screen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA pooling</ENAMEX> is a practical way to reduce the cost of
          large-scale case-control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies, because it
          allows measurement of allele frequencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (or
          pools) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, thereby reducing the number of PCR
          reactions and genotyping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">assays</ENAMEX> dramatically. Primer
          extension is the technique that has been most commonly
          used in pooling studies to genotype <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> and the results
          have been very good [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution</ENAMEX> of allele
          frequency differences between cases and controls in
          pooling studies is limited, however, by so called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>-measurement and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>-formation errors. Differential
          amplification of different SNPs during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and the
          limited accuracy of the detection method lead to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>-measurement errors. For example, allele frequency
          estimates of pools using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MALDI-TOF</ENAMEX> mass spectroscopy have
          been reported to deviate from real by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 3%</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] . Another source of error is caused by unequal
          amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> being contributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that make
          up the pool (pool-formation errors). In principle the
          power of pooling studies can be improved by creating
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (reducing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>-formation errors) and multiple measurement of allele
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> (reducing the pool-measurement error).
          However, for our study we propose to follow the
          recommendations as recently outlined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sham et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
          . They state that a two-stage design, in which markers
          showing positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> in a pooling study are
          followed up by confirmatory individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotyping</ENAMEX>, might
          represent the best trade-off between the cost savings of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pooling</ENAMEX> and the full information provided by individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX>. We propose to test the full marker set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> in the genome screen using pooled assays
          with a relatively liberal p-value (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>) to
          allow adequate power even with information loss. Markers
          that show significance in the pooled assay will then be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyped</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> of the original case-control
          sample to confirm the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Identifying genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polygenic ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> has been
        a difficult task and most human studies have employed a
        candidate gene approach [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] although at least one
        genomewide linkage scan in affected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sibling</NUMEX> pairs is on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . We propose to use a combination of a candidate
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> study and genomewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> scan in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX> at high (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">230</NUMEX> cases) or low (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>) risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> as determined by
        their TCD velocity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes for complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> have been criticized because of non-replication of
        results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] and studies of genetic risk factors in
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> have been no exception [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 22</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rish</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        ] has argued that the most likely reason for the high
        false-positive rate is the low prior probability in most
        candidate gene studies that the examined polymorphisms are
        causally related to the disease outcome. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes that we propose to
        study have been shown to be associated with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hypercoagulable</ENAMEX> state or have been shown to be involved in
        pathways leading to the development of vasculopathy and,
        therefore, have a high probability to be related to the TCD
        velocity phenotype.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the causes for conflicting results in candidate
        gene studies and in particular for spurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> is
        believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> stratification or admixture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Population stratification</ENAMEX> refers to the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subgroups</ENAMEX>, e.g. ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, in the sample and can
        potentially cause a spurious association between the locus
        and trait. A spurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> due to population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stratification</ENAMEX> can only occur when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions hold: (i)
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> strata differ with respect to the phenotype,
        and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> strata differ in allele
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> stratification is
        frequently used as an explanation for non-replicable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> in the literature, there are few actual
        examples to support this assumption [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in
        the field now agree that the problem has probably been
        overstated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wacholder et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> stratification of an extent large
        enough to distort results is unlikely to occur in many
        realistic situations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ardlie et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] evaluated 4
        moderately sized case-control studies for the presence of
        population structure and concluded that carefully matched
        case-control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in cosmopolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are unlikely to contain levels of population
        stratification that would result in significantly inflated
        numbers of false positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. We therefore
        believe that hidden stratification is unlikely to be a
        problem in our case-control study of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sickle cell disease</ENAMEX> at high or low risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> based on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> values. However,
        methods are being developed by which unlinked genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> can be used to detect stratification and even
        correct for it when it is present [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . In the
        unlikely event of spurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> results, we will be
        able to use these methods to detect and adjust for the
        effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> stratification present.
        Furthermore, the study of other genetic markers, namely the
        distribution of Î²-globin haplotypes and the frequency of
        deletional Î±-thalassemia among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sickle cell disease</ENAMEX> from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> do not show significant differences arguing
        against significant population admixture in this group [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 30 31</NUMEX> ] .
        Our genomewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> scan aimed at identifying
        novel polymorphisms associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> risk will
        necessarily have a somewhat exploratory character. The
        reason is simply that this approach has only recently
        become possible with the advent of high throughput SNP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotyping</ENAMEX> and we are not currently aware of any published
        studies that have used genomewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> for
        identification of susceptibility loci of complex traits.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> issues are worth discussing at this point: (i) the
        optimization of selection criteria for the case and control
        pools and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> markers needed to
        provide adequate coverage of the whole genome.
        Our definition of cases and controls in this study is
        based on absolute cut-off values for TCD velocity. For
        quantitative traits like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> velocity, loss of efficiency
        in a pooling design is due to loss of information from
        within-pool phenotypic differences. In the absence of
        experimental errors, this information loss can be minimized
        by optimizing the criteria for selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        from the extreme tails of the distribution for the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pools</ENAMEX>, which turns out to be the upper and lower <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> of
        this distribution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, this optimal
        pooling fraction is largely independent of marker frequency
        and mode of inheritance of the trait. Exploration of
        alternative selection criteria for cases and controls in
        our genomewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> study will be dependent on the
        combined TCD distribution of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000 to1400</TIMEX> new patients
        that will be screened as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">STOP-II</ENAMEX> study and the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TCD â‰¥ 200 cm/</ENAMEX>s) from the original STOP study
        that are already available.
        The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that are required for whole-genome
        linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping has been a hotly
        debated issue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>. Initial simulation
        estimates based on monotonic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> expansion suggested
        that useful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> was unlikely to extend beyond <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> kb, implying
        a number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> SNPs necessary for a whole-genome scan
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Another study looking at real data found that LD
        extended over much larger distances and arrived at an
        estimate as small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 SNP</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kb</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        ] . Recent evidence suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> consists of
        blocks of high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> (haplotype blocks) separated by
        recombination hot spots [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Within each block, a
        limited number of common haplotypes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five</NUMEX>)
        typically capture <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 90%</NUMEX> of all chromosomes, which means
        that a reduced number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> would be needed to
        characterize these haplotypes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the recently
        initiated construction of a haplotype map of the human
        genome may facilitate selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> markers for
        genomewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies like ours. In the meantime,
        replication of significant associations detected in the
        candidate gene part of the study with our genomewide
        approach should provide us with practical estimates for the
        likely density of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> markers needed for successful LD
        mapping.
        The practical and clinical implications of potential
        findings of this study remain unclear. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more polymorphisms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes with a
        high TCD (high risk) phenotype will enable the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to streamline the screening and follow-up
        programs towards those with high risk as determined by
        genetic testing. The incorporation of any preventive or
        therapeutic measures into this program will depend not only
        on the findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of high TCD phenotype with
        certain SNPs but also on the results of the ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">STOP II</ENAMEX>
        study, which is studying the optimal duration of
        transfusion in these high risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        In conclusion, we believe that our dual approach of a
        candidate gene and whole-genome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> study will
        yield important information on genetic risk factors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX> in sickle cell disease. Not only
        will this generate important knowledge for improving
        treatment and prevention options of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb SS</ENAMEX>,
        polymorphisms showing a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> will also
        be strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for stroke risk in the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> can efficiently be confirmed
        in banked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> of large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> cases and controls
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
