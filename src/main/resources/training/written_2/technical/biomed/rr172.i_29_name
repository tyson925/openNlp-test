        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of inhaled particulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> and
        cigarette smoking with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary disease</ENAMEX>, such as chronic
        obstructive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary disease</ENAMEX>, is well documented [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ,
        but the specific early responses of lung epithelial cells
        to toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> in particulates - that predispose the
        cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> - have not been elucidated. Cigarette
        smoke has also been considered a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in the
        pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and as a trigger for acute symptoms
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Exposure to cigarette smoke activates an
        inflammatory cascade in the airway epithelium resulting in
        the production of a number of potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytokines</ENAMEX> and
        chemokines, with accompanying damage to the lung
        epithelium, increased permeability, and recruitment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> and neutrophils to the airway [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Even
        brief exposure to cigarette smoke has been shown to
        increase expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-8</ENAMEX> in primary cultures of human
        bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs) in the presence of dust
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mite allergen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Increased release of the chemokine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX> has also been shown for cultured HBEs exposed to
        cigarette smoke extract (CSE) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] and diesel exhaust
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . However, the precise molecular events
        that bring about these intracellular changes and acute
        inflammation in lung epithelial cells are not well
        understood.
        Upregulation of cytokine gene expression in epithelial
        cells has been linked to activation of specific signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. Involvement of the mitogen-activated protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) pathway, extracellular signal-regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (ERK)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p44/p42</ENAMEX>), in cytokine regulation
        has been demonstrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBEs</ENAMEX> exposed to diesel exhaust
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] but not to cigarette smoke. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB is a
        ubiquitous transcription factor involved in regulating
        inflammatory responses, and its targets include several of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding cytokines and chemokines. The activation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB by oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, inflammatory cytokines such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±</ENAMEX> has been studied in depth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , but
        much less is known about the effects of cigarette smoke on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB activation.
        The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the
        mechanism of inflammation induced by cigarette smoke,
        specifically the acute response to smoke. The human
        alveolar epithelial cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> and normal human
        bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) were exposed to the
        particulate fraction of cigarette smoke (cigarette smoke
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">condensate; CSC</ENAMEX>) and examined for the production of
        proinflammatory cytokines and activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎºB.</ENAMEX>
        The results demonstrate that the acute phase response of
        pulmonary epithelial cells to cigarette smoke involves
        activation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB

          Effects of cigarette smoke condensate on cell
          viability and apoptosis
          To determine the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> on cell viability,
          A549 cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> were exposed to increasing
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min then examined using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">trypan</ENAMEX> blue dye-exclusion test (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Maximum
          toxicity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A549</TIMEX> at the highest concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>. At lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> concentrations (<<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), survival was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> for both A549 cells
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX>. Induction of apoptosis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> was determined
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> assay and
          confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis (data not shown).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> apoptosis at moderate doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>;
          A549 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> showed less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> apoptosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B).
          However, with increasing concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>, NHBEs
          showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 20%</NUMEX> apoptosis, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells
          remained unchanged.
        
        
          Changes in expression of specific cytokines and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemokines</ENAMEX> after exposure to cigarette smoke
          condensate
          To characterize the response of epithelial cells to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> we determined the changes in message levels for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of cytokines, chemokines and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-adhesion
          molecules. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> following
          exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> was subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>, and the results
          are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> was induced to a level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.5</NUMEX>
          times that of untreated controls, while the expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX> was increased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>-fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-fold,
          respectively. Expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1
          was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1.6</NUMEX> times the level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> and the chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANTES</ENAMEX> were elevated
          slightly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This pattern of enhancement of
          proinflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> expression implies that specific
          effector compounds are present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Involvement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway in response to
          cigarette smoke condensate
          To examine if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>-upregulation of cytokine production
          involves activation of MAPKs we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> for specific phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3Ashows
          the results of a western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blot</ENAMEX> of whole-cell extracts from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> exposed to increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> and
          probed for phosphorylated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>, the activated form of
          ERK1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>. Band densities on the film were measured and the
          protein loading variations were adjusted by normalizing
          to the levels of non-phosphorylated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>. The level of
          ERK1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX> phosphorylation increased rapidly with increasing
          exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>, to a maximum of nearly twice the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. To confirm the results of immunoblot detection
          of phosphorylated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> were exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, then fixed and stained for phosphorylated
          ERK1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>. Exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> caused a marked increase in
          nuclear staining of cells with phosphorylated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3B</ENAMEX>). This nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ERK1/2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was largely blocked by
          pretreating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEK</ENAMEX> inhibitor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PD98059</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>-induced increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> expression was also reduced
          by treatment of the cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD98059</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB
          inhibitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDTC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). These results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activates</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> in these cells within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min.
        
        
          Cigarette smoke condensate treatment induces rapid
          activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB pathway
          To determine whether upregulation of cytokine
          production by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> involved activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">examined CSC</ENAMEX>-treated epithelial cells for phosphorylation
          of the inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎºB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎºB</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> were treated with
          increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> and whole-cell extracts
          were immunoblotted for phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎºB.</ENAMEX> Activation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB involves the increased phosphorylation and
          proteolytic degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎºB.</ENAMEX> Treatment of cells with
          increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> resulted in an initial
          rise in phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB levels followed by a decrease
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein bands</ENAMEX> were quantitated by densitometry
          on the film and the phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB densities were

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> using an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎºB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.

          Effect of cigarette smoke condensate on
          transcriptional activation of luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX>
          construct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> appears to activate NFÎºB, which should result in
          transcriptional activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB-inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells were transfected with a luciferase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid containing a promoter sequence that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bound NFÎºB</ENAMEX> and luciferase activity was measured after
          challenge with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>. Treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          min resulted in significant enhancement of luciferase
          reporter expression compared to control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C),

          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid to increasing doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>
          showed NFÎºB expression peaking at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> concentration
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 Î¼g/</ENAMEX>ml (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The complex changes in lung function, morphology, and
        gene expression caused by compounds in cigarette smoke
        involve a combination of direct and indirect effects on
        cells, but principally center around an increase in airway
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> as a result of cigarette smoking. The results
        of our studies demonstrate that the mechanism underlying
        these acute inflammatory events involves activation of
        specific signaling pathways such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB,
        leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the important observations of this study is the
        effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX>. Even at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>, which does not induce significant changes in the
        viability of these cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> induced increases in
        expression of several cytokines at the mRNA level. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IL-1Î²,</ENAMEX>
        which was significantly upregulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>
        exposure, has been shown to be important for activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . This is also consistent with
        the report that epithelial cells regulate inflammatory
        events by secreting cytokines and chemokines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sICAM-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . These paracrine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effectors</ENAMEX> can then produce further primary local
        inflammation or amplify the effects of previously activated
        macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, or lymphocytes. A
        notable finding from our study is that exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> elicits the synthesis and release of a pattern of
        mediators similar to that seen in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A549</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>. These results imply that neoplastic cells and normal
        cells respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> in a similar manner.
        Cigarette smoke has been shown by others to induce a
        synthesis of glutathione and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-glutamylcysteine</ENAMEX> that
        was associated with transcription factor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-1 or an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-like response element [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPKs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB
        have been implicated in the upregulation of proinflammatory
        cytokines, the role of these pathways in normal human
        pulmonary epithelial cells in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> has not been
        investigated. The results of our study implicate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p42/44</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> pathway as a key element in this inflammatory
        response, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> that has not heretofore been
        reported in normal human pulmonary epithelial cells. A
        significant finding of this study is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAPKs</ENAMEX> such as
        ERK1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p44/p42</ENAMEX>) are consistently activated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX>.
        However, upon exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>, the magnitude of
        phosphorylation increases. The finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>
        expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPK</ENAMEX> activation are concomitantly increased
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> exposure and inhibited by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PD98059</TIMEX> is consistent with
        the report that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPKs</ENAMEX> activate expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-1Î² genes</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . Although the control of cytok-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> confluence on

        recommendations. Cells were transfected using lipofectamine
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibco/BRL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). The plasmid, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pVAX-LacZ</ENAMEX>,
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was used as transfection

        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>/lipofectamine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were allowed to form for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> at room temperature in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPMI</ENAMEX> (without antibiotics)
        containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> plasmid, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pVAX-LacZ</ENAMEX> for
        monitoring transfection efficiency, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipofectamine</ENAMEX>. Cells were transfected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> h. Prior to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> challenge, the transfected cells were preincubated for
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> in minimal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earle</ENAMEX>'s salts to
        remove serum factors. Assays were done in triplicate and
        consisted of untreated controls, treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>. After treatments,
        the cells were lysed by addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysis buffer as
        supplied in the luciferase assay kit from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clontech</ENAMEX>, scraped
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> and centrifuged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,000</NUMEX> Ã— 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g. Aliquots</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of each lysate
        were transferred to flat-bottomed, white microtiter plates
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chantilly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and read on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynex MLX</ENAMEX> plate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> in flash mode. The transfection efficiency was
        normalized by determining Î²-galactosidase activity in the
        lysates from the cotransfected pLacZ plasmid.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In essence, these results demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHBEs</ENAMEX> respond
        to moderate doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> by activating both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ERK1/2</NUMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFÎ</ENAMEX>ºB pathways, and by upregulating the expression of
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding proinflammatory molecules.
