        Sleep is regulated by both circadian and homeostatic
        mechanisms. As a consequence of a signal from the circadian
        clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> hypothalamus in mammals [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , sleep is more
        likely to occur at certain times of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h day than
        others, thereby determining the daily sleep-wake
        distribution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Sleep is homeostatically regulated in
        the sense that sleep drive accumulates in the absence of
        sleep and decreases during sleep. Changes in sleep drive
        are thus driven by the sleep-wake history. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeostatic</ENAMEX> and
        circadian mechanisms interact to determine the duration and
        quality of sleep and wakefulness [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Homeostatic
        regulation of sleep can still be observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that
        lack circadian rhythms after lesioning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX>
        ] , suggesting that circadian rhythms and sleep homeostasis
        are independent processes.
        Homeostatic regulation of sleep can be quantified
        objectively after a period of enforced wakefulness (i.e.,
        sleep deprivation), although a similar relationship between
        sleep parameters and spontaneous wakefulness can be
        quantified under baseline conditions as well [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        The compensatory responses in time spent asleep, sleep
        consolidation (i.e., sleep bout duration; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ), and/or
        sleep intensity observed after an extended period of
        wakefulness are all taken as evidence that sleep drive is
        increased during wakefulness and thus that sleep is
        homeostatically regulated. Non-REM sleep (NREMS) intensity,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> power in the delta frequency range (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-4</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> consolidation are in a quantitative and
        predictive relationship with sleep history: both variables
        increase with the duration of prior wakefulness and
        subsequently decline during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 10 12 13</NUMEX> ] . These
        variables are thus quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> of NREMS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX> and are presumed to reflect an underlying
        physiological drive for sleep [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        The time constants describing the dynamics of the
        increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NREMS</ENAMEX> drive during wakefulness and decreasing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NREMS</ENAMEX> drive during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 14</NUMEX> ] are compatible with a
        role for changes in gene expression in their regulation.
        Although past studies have shown that extended periods of
        wakefulness cause changes in gene expression (for review
        see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ), no causal relationship between changes in
        gene expression and sleep homeostasis has been identified.
        A recent study in 
        Drosophila melanogaster implicates
        transcriptional regulation by the circadian gene 
        cycle , a homolog of the mammalian 
        bmal1 gene, in the homeostatic
        regulation of rest [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . While rest in flies shares
        several features with sleep in mammals [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , it
        remains to be determined whether a similar role for BMAL1
        or related transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> is necessary for the
        homeostatic regulation of sleep.
        In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> and mammals, circadian rhythms are thought
        to be generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptional</ENAMEX>/translational feedback
        loops comprising a network of transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . The core of this self-sustained molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillation</ENAMEX> consists of positive and negative elements. In
        mammals, the positive elements are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic
        helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS-domain-containing transcription
        factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLOCK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMAL1</ENAMEX>, that form heterodimers that can
        drive the transcription of three 
        period ( 
        per ) genes 
        per1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and two</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptochromes</ENAMEX> ( 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> ). PER1,2 and CRY1,2 proteins
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppress CLOCK</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BMAL1</NUMEX>-mediated transcription thereby forming
        the negative elements in the feedback loop. Consistent with
        their central role in circadian rhythm generation, genetic
        inactivation of both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptochromes</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cry1,2 -/-</ENAMEX>) results in circadian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrhythmicity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . Given the widespread
        expression of the elements of the molecular clock in the
        brain (and elsewhere) and the large number of genes
        regulated by bHLH-PAS transcription factors (e.g. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ),
        the role of 
        cryptochromes may extend beyond
        circadian clock function. To determine whether
        transcriptional regulation by CRY1,2 influences the
        homeostatic regulation of sleep, we studied sleep in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> under baseline
        conditions, under conditions of constant darkness, and
        after sleep deprivation (SD). The expression of circadian
        genes that are regulated by 
        cryptochromes were evaluated in the
        brain of 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and in sleep deprived
        wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.

          Sleep regulation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cry1,2</NUMEX> -<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/-mice</ENAMEX>
          In baseline conditions, wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> showed the
          sleep-wake distribution typical for this nocturnal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with high values of sleep in the light period and
          low values in the dark period (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          sleep-wake distribution in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was distinct from
          that of wild type controls (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in that sleep
          variables did not differ between the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-h light</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>) and
          dark (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Nevertheless, as in wild type
          controls, the light-to-dark transition was accompanied by
          a pronounced decrease in sleep time in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          During baseline, total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> NREMS time was
          significantly greater in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> than in wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">683 ± 25</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">576 ± 12 min</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.002</ENAMEX>, unpaired
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test), whereas the daily time spent in REM sleep did
          not differ (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">118 ± 7</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">113 ± 10 min</NUMEX>). The difference
          between genotypes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> time was present only in the
          dark period and not in the light (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Average NREMS bout duration, a measure of NREMS
          consolidation that is positively correlated with a high
          homeostatic sleep pressure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , was greater by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> in
          
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> relative to wild
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> during the light period, and by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> during the
          dark period (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Consistent with this increase in
          sleep consolidation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> delta power was significantly
          higher in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-than in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> during most of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baseline</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power
          was specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> and did not extend to other EEG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>), indicating that the increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> power is not due to a difference in EEG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>-specific EEG difference in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> power was especially evident at the wake-to-NREMS
          transition. 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exhibited higher
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> power values than

          onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
          The same genotypic differences in sleep were observed
          in constant dark (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>) conditions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> lacking

          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The decrease in sleep time prior to the onset

          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>; sleep time
          decreased in the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the subjective day and
          minimum average sleep time was reached immediately after
          the onset of the subjective <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          anticipatory decrease in sleep time that occurred prior

          To further investigate the homeostatic regulation of
          sleep in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we assayed the
          compensatory response to a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 h SD</TIMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> displayed the typical increase in REMS
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> bout duration, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power
          above baseline levels ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In
          contrast, 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> did not exhibit
          significant increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> time or NREMS bout
          duration after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>; only a brief increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> delta
          power was observed (lasting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The initial increase in delta power
          (relative to baseline), measured over the first recovery
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>, was significantly smaller in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-than the increase
          observed in wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> power (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> bout duration (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 1, 2</ENAMEX>), in 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is maintained at a
          level only attained by the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> when their
          sleep pressure was highest, i.e., at the end of the
          active or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX> period and after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>.
          In wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power still varied as a
          function of the sleep-wake history with high values at
          the end of the baseline dark period and after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> and
          low values at the end of the light or major rest period
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Presumably due to the altered sleep-wake
          distribution, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power values
          was smaller in 
          cry1 , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> than in wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We tested the assumption of a
          relationship between delta power and the sleep-wake
          history by using a mathematical method that predicts the
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power occurring in individual NREMS
          bouts based on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> h sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-sec behavioral
          state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . With this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> tool, the time constants of the increasing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> power during wakefulness and its decrease during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> are estimated. For both genotypes, delta power in
          both baseline and recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> could be reliably
          predicted on the basis of sleep-wake history (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          which is underscored by the highly significant
          correlations between empirical and simulated data (r =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.91 and 0.87</NUMEX> for 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> +/+and

          varied as a function of the prior sleep-wake history.
          However, in

          shorter time constant for the increase (i.e., a faster

          per2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 23 27</NUMEX> ] , in the middle
          of the daily light period. Confirming the earlier studies
          in other tissues, mRNA levels for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          higher in the brains of 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> compared to wild
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This relative increase was highly
          significant for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
          dbp, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">per1</TIMEX> : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX>-fold;

          Sleep deprivation-induced differences in circadian
          gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Messenger RNA</ENAMEX> levels for 
          per1 , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 ,</ENAMEX> 
          cry1 , 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and 
          dbp were quantified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> brain areas (cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamus</ENAMEX>) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were sacrificed
          immediately after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 h</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> or after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> of recovery
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sleep</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ZT10</NUMEX>). Significant differences in expression were
          observed only in the cortex (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>) and not in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamus</ENAMEX> or basal forebrain (data not shown). Both 
          per1 and 
          per2 mRNA levels were higher
          immediately after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> compared to controls, 
          cry1,2 expression did not change,
          and 
          dbp <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> decreased significantly
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> of recovery sleep, 
          per1 , 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and 
          dbp expression returned to the
          normal levels for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time of day</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZT10</TIMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>). We
          also measured the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> other circadian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: 
          bmal1 , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clock ,</ENAMEX> 
          npas2 , 
          per3 , and 
          casein kinase <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1-ε</NUMEX> ( 
          csnk1e ) in the cortex; the levels
          of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> were not affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown).
          As confirmation of our results in the mouse, we
          determined the expression of 
          per2 and 
          per1 in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and
          Northern analysis, respectively. In a similar
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paradigm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were sleep deprived for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h
          and then either sacrificed immediately after the SD
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ZT6</NUMEX>), or after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h</TIMEX> of recovery sleep (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZT8</TIMEX>; n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5/group</NUMEX>).
          The cortex-specific increase in 
          per2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> was confirmed by the
          RT-PCR analysis and, as in the mouse, 
          per2 expression returned to basal
          levels after a period of recovery sleep (data not shown).
          Northern analysis confirmed that recovery sleep was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a decline in 
          per1 mRNA relative to the level of
          expression reached at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Upon release into constant darkness 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> immediately become
        arrhythmic at the behavioral level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] , at the level
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electrophysiology</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] , and at the
        cellular/molecular level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Of the available mouse
        models for circadian dysfunction, only 
        per1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> double mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] , 
        bmal1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        with an ablation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] show a similarly
        dramatic phenotype. Thus, 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> appear to be a
        suitable model for studies of the regulation of sleep in
        the absence of an intact circadian clock.
        Under light / dark (LD) conditions, running wheel
        activity patterns and, as we show here, the distribution of
        sleep in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> still exhibit diurnal
        variation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> can influence the expression of sleep
        by entraining the circadian pacemaker that drives the
        diurnal rhythm of sleep and/or by directly affecting the
        expression of sleep, thereby 'masking' the influence of the
        pacemaker on sleep. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masking</ENAMEX> seems to be the mechanism by
        which light drives these rhythms under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LD</ENAMEX> conditions in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , since the
        daily modulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> that occurs in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> under a light/dark
        cycle immediately disappears upon placement in constant
        darkness ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). At the molecular level, 
        per2 expression (but not that of 
        per1 ) is rhythmic in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> of 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LD</ENAMEX> conditions.
        Upon release into constant dark conditions, 
        per2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> disappears
        concomitant with the immediate loss of behavioral
        rhythmicity, suggesting a role for 'light-driven' 
        per2 expression in generating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behavioral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhythms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        The most striking and unexpected finding of the current
        study is that, under baseline conditions, 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exhibit all the
        hallmarks of high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> pressure, including more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consolidated NREMS</ENAMEX>, increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> time, and higher levels
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power relative to wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX> that were
        attained immediately after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> onset. The failure of 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to exhibit a robust
        increase in any of these measures after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 h SD</TIMEX> is
        consistent with the interpretation that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are
        already under high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> pressure during baseline
        conditions. Determination of the time constants that most
        accurately describe the dynamics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> delta power
        revealed that during wake, the propensity for high NREMS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> power increases during wake in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at a faster rate than
        in wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>. This could help explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> delta
        power is chronically high in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The coincidence of
        high NREMS time and chronically high delta power in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is all the more
        striking when one considers that during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX>, the drive
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> should dissipate and result in lower delta power
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 32</NUMEX> ] .
        These findings in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> contrast with the
        findings of sleep studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that are rendered
        arrhythmic by lesioning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nocturnal rodents</ENAMEX>,
        lesioning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> results in more fragmented sleep, with
        lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power, but leaving the daily sleep time
        unchanged [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 31</NUMEX> ] . Lesioning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX> in a diurnal
        primate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">squirrel monkey</ENAMEX>, did result in an increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> time, but sleep was more fragmented, with a higher
        proportion of 'light' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] ; i.e., with lower
        overall levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power. Furthermore, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostatic</ENAMEX> response to sleep deprivation does not seem to
        be altered in SCN-lesioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Thus, the
        sleep characteristics of 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> do not support the
        concept of 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> as simply a genetic
        model for ablation of the circadian clock in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX>.
        Together, these unexpected results are compatible with a
        role for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptochromes</ENAMEX> in the homeostatic
        regulation of sleep in addition to their role in generating
        circadian rhythms.
        Recent observations, including the current report,
        suggest a complex interrelationship between homeostatic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circadian</ENAMEX> influences on sleep at the molecular level.
        Deletion of the 
        cycle gene in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> produces flies that have
        an exaggerated homeostatic response to rest deprivation in
        addition to their lack of circadian rhythmicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . In
        a striking parallel to our current results, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> with a
        mutation in the 
        cryptochrome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> also exhibit
        increased rest time as well as a reduced compensatory
        response to rest deprivation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Shaw</ENAMEX>, personal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). The 
        clock mutation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, which has a
        profound effect on circadian rhythmicity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , decreases
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> time and consolidation under baseline conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
        ] . The 
        clock sleep phenotype is the inverse
        of the sleep characteristics we report here for the 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and is thus consistent
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLOCK</ENAMEX> and CRY1,2 being positive and negative
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, respectively. 
        Albumin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dbp</ENAMEX> ) is a transcription factor whose
        expression is under the direct transcriptional control of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLOCK</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BMAL1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Deletion of the 
        dbp gene, which results in a
        shortening of the circadian period [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , also results in
        decreased sleep consolidation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> delta power [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
        .
        We assume that the effects on sleep we observed in 
        cry1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are a result of a lack of 
        cryptochrome -dependent inhibition of
        the transcriptional activation provided by the bHLH-PAS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimers CLOCK</ENAMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMAL1 and NPAS2</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BMAL1</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 37</NUMEX> ] ,
        although 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cryptochromes</ENAMEX> also play a role in
        stabilizing and nuclear sequestration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PER proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
        ] , and in photoreception [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Lack of 
        cryptochromes results in increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1</ENAMEX> target genes, including
        the circadian genes 
        per1 and 
        per2 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 23</NUMEX> ] . The expression of
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is viewed as a state variable of the
        molecular circadian clock or a marker of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CLOCK/NPAS2:</ENAMEX>BMAL1-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX>, although at least 
        per1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> can also be
        (rapidly) induced by light [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] , through a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREB</ENAMEX>-dependent signaling pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] . The
        observation of high brain levels of 
        per1,2 transcripts under baseline
        conditions in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> raises the possibility
        that these or other <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1</ENAMEX> target genes are
        involved in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The
        observation of elevated 
        per gene expression in the cortex of
        sleep-deprived <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) supports this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
        The increase in 
        per expression after the sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX> was specific to the cerebral cortex, although
        it cannot be ruled out, based on the present study, that
        circadian gene expression changes with sleep-wake history
        in specific nuclei within the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions examined;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, the hypothalamus and basal forebrain. A surprisingly
        small number (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX>) of the ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> screened by mRNA
        differential display and cDNA microarrays in the cortex to
        date change their expression with sleep deprivation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ]
        . It is intriguing and encouraging that, of the initial
        genes we assayed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> changed their expression with sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX> ( 
        per1 , 
        per2 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dbp</ENAMEX> ), none of which were identified
        in the aforementioned screens. 
        cry1,2 expression at the mRNA level
        did not change with sleep deprivation in wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>.
        This observation does not necessarily obviate a direct role
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CRY proteins</ENAMEX> in mediating a response to sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX>. CRY poteins may play a role at steady state
        levels or there may be post-translational changes in the
        functioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CRY proteins</ENAMEX> in association with sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX>, such as phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, ubiquitination
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , or intracellular localization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, all of which are regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dynamically</ENAMEX>, at least 
        in vitro . In the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, CRY protein
        oscillations are not necessary for circadian oscillations
        of target transcripts, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CRY proteins</ENAMEX> are present in
        excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PER</ENAMEX> and oscillations in the latter produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhythmicity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . A similar situation might exist in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX>.
        The high 
        per levels in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and the low 
        per levels in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clock mutant mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 47</NUMEX> ] correlate
        with their contrasting sleep phenotype (see above; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ]
        ). In this context, the sleep abnormalities in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dbp -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> might also be related to
        a reduction in 
        per expression since, at least 
        in vitro , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBP</ENAMEX> can amplify the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLOCK</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BMAL1</NUMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> of 
        per [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] , but it is not known
        whether 
        per transcript levels are altered in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dbp -/-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Apart from the present
        observations in sleep-deprived <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, several other
        reports confirm that cortical levels of 
        per expression in wild type animals
        are high at times when sleep drive is high, irrespective of
        the phase at which the circadian expression of 
        per peaks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX>. Thus, in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nocturnal</ENAMEX> and diurnal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
        per expression in the cortex is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maximal</ENAMEX> in conjunction with the major waking episode [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] . Under conditions where the phase (methamphetamine
        administration, restricted feeding) or distribution
        (circadian splitting) of locomotor activity is altered, 
        per expression in the cortex
        parallels the overt rhythm of wakefulness, whereas the
        circadian oscillation of 
        per gene expression in the SCN
        remains unaffected [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 51 52</NUMEX> ] . Thus, in contrast to its
        role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PER protein</ENAMEX> in the cortex is not a
        component of a self-sustaining circadian oscillator [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ]
        . Instead, 
        per expression in the cortex seems to
        the follow sleep-wake history, consistent with the
        hypothesis that it is related to homeostatic regulation of
        sleep. However, in the current study and those cited above,
        the expression of 
        per genes was studied at the mRNA
        level. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PER protein</ENAMEX> level may be affected differentially
        from that of 
        per mRNA and levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PER</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are reduced in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>-/- <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> due to reduced
        stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PER proteins</ENAMEX> in the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimerizing CRY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 38 46</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        In the discussion, we have focused on 
        per1,2 mRNAs as transcriptional
        targets of 
        cry1,2 because the expression
        patterns of these circadian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have been widely
        described and because their transcriptional control by CRY
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1</ENAMEX> has been well
        established. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are regulated in a similar
        fashion by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPAS2</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">BMAL1</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] and the identity of the
        target genes critical for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> phenotype in 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/- <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> remains to be
        determined. In the absence of 
        cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> , the stability and overall
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PER proteins</ENAMEX>, particularly in the nucleus of the
        cell, is reduced [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 38 46</NUMEX> ] . It would therefore be
        interesting to observe sleep in 
        per1,2 single and double mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
        the latter of which have been subjected to behavioral
        observation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] but not to sleep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> studies. 
        per1 single knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        expressing a non-functional PER2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> both exhibit
        subtle differences from wild type in the homeostatic
        rebound after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] , an observation compatible with
        the hypothesis that these genes are correlates of sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX>. In addition, measurement of the effects of
        sleep deprivation on the expression of 
        cry1,2 and 
        per1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level
        will provide critical information. Finally, from a
        functional perspective, it is interesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1</ENAMEX> transcriptional activity is sensitive to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">redox</ENAMEX> state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . This transcriptional activity might
        thus provide a link between neuronal activity and an energy
        regulatory function for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX>, as has been suggested
        previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Sleep studies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were generated by mating 
          cry1 and 
          cry2 single knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, both of
          mixed background (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ca. 3/4 C57BL/6</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</NUMEX> 129/Sv; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] )
          to generate double heterozygotes that were interbred to
          generate double knockouts ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cry1,2 -/-</ENAMEX>) and wild type controls
          ( 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> +/+). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> wild type and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were surgically
          prepared for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> and electromyographic (EMG) recordings
          as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . Following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of
          post-surgical recovery, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were isolated for recordings
          in sound-attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. The experiments were
          conducted under an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">LD12:12</TIMEX> cycle (lights-on; i.e.,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeitgeber Time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ZT0</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0600</TIMEX> h). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> hour baseline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recordings</ENAMEX>, starting at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZT0</TIMEX>, were followed by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h sleep
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX> (SD) starting at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZT0</TIMEX>. The sleep deprivations
          in this experiment and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> experiments (see
          below) were performed by the introduction of novel
          objects into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> or by gentle handling. In addition
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were subjected to one day
          of baseline recording in constant darkness separated from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> experiment by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX>. All experimental
          procedures complied with institutional and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>
          guidelines.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digitized EEG</ENAMEX> and integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> were stored in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epochs</ENAMEX> and classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REM</ENAMEX> sleep (REMS), or
          wakefulness by visual inspection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> was subjected
          to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fast-Fourier-Transformation</ENAMEX> yielding power spectra
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-20 Hz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> power was calculated as the
          average EEG power in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-4 Hz</ENAMEX>) frequencies for
          epochs scored as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX>. For visual representation, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX>-power values (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were expressed relative to
          an individual mean (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h baseline mean) before
          transforming back to absolute values to capture both the
          highly reproducible individual time course of delta power
          and the genotype differences in absolute values [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          Statistical evaluation of genotype differences were
          based, however, on the absolute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> values. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-SD</ENAMEX> delta
          power was compared to baseline during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour of</TIMEX>
          spontaneous sleep subsequent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>, while NREMS amount
          and bout duration (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were compared over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ZT6-ZT18</ENAMEX>), in accordance with the distinct dynamics of
          the compensatory responses of these variables to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>
          ] . NREMS bouts were defined as periods of NREMS
          initiated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three consecutive 10-second</TIMEX> epochs of NREMS
          and terminated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive epochs</TIMEX> not classified
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG</ENAMEX> delta power changes at transitions between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wakefulness</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> were measured during those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transitions</ENAMEX> characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 12</NUMEX> consecutive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-s
          epochs of wake followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 18</NUMEX> consecutive
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-epochs</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX>.
          A mathematical algorithm was used to quantify the
          sleep-wake dependent dynamics of delta power during both
          baseline and recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In this algorithm,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> power decreases during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NREMS</ENAMEX> and increases during
          wakefulness according to saturating exponential
          functions, the time constants of which are estimated by
          minimizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the differences between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empirical</ENAMEX> (delta power) data and the values produced by
          the mathematical functions. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> time constants (for
          the increase and decrease of delta power) that resulted
          in the smallest deviation from empirical values within
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> were used to statistically assess
          genotype effect on the dynamics of delta power [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Northern analysis
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five</TIMEX> 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> -/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> wild type
          controls were sacrificed in the middle of the light
          period (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ZT6</NUMEX>). Brains were rapidly removed and frozen on
          dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis
          was performed with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 </NUMEX>g whole brain total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as
          previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> Wistar <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were sleep deprived for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h beginning
          at light-onset (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ZT0</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were sacrificed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZT6</TIMEX> at
          the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> were allowed to recover for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> and were sacrificed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ZT8</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were
          monitored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEG/EMG</ENAMEX> throughout this period as described
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Brains were rapidly removed, dissected and
          frozen, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Northern</ENAMEX> analysis performed.
        
        
          Quantitative real-time Reverse-Transcriptase

          followed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-h</TIMEX> recovery sleep (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ZT6-ZT10</ENAMEX>); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for the recovery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
          were sacrificed by decapitation. Brains were rapidly
          removed and the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and
          hypothalamus were dissected. After a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-sagittal</TIMEX> cut,
          the entire cortical tissue was peeled off and separated
          from the hippocampus and underlying diencephalon.
          Striatal tissue was also removed. From each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>,
          quantitative real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> determinations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX> target
          genes ( 
          cry1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">per1,2</NUMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dbp</ENAMEX> ) and a reference cDNA
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,</ENAMEX> 
          g3pdh ) were made from the cortex,
          basal forebrain, and hypothalamus (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">primer</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> sequences
          available upon request). For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> (

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clock ,</ENAMEX> 
          npas2 , 
          per3 , and 
          csnk1e ), expression was quantified
          in the cortex only. To confirm the specificity of the
          nucleotide sequences chosen for the primers and probes
          and the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymorphisms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTN</ENAMEX> searches
          were conducted against the dbEST and nonredundant set of
          Genbank, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBL</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDBJ</ENAMEX> databases. Dual color
          fluorescence was detected using an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prism</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7700</TIMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, CA). For each experimental sample, the amount of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> and 
          g3pdh reference was determined from
          the standard curve (range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ng total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>)
          measured in the same assay. A normalized value was
          obtained by dividing the target cDNA amount by the
