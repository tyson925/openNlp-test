        Loss of myocytes is thought to contribute to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progressivedecline</ENAMEX> in left ventricular function and the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestiveheart failure</ENAMEX>. Recent studies have
        proposed that myocyte loss incardiomyopathy can occur by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> without an inflammatory response [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reviewedin</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] ]. In heart failure,growth stimulation initially
        occurs as a compensatory effort tomeet chronically altered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemodynamic</ENAMEX> demands and is mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">systemicand</ENAMEX>/or local
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of adrenergic pathways andby
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytokines</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, cytokinescan be
        directly toxic to cardiac myocytes and result in
        increasedapoptotic cell death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 6</NUMEX> ] . Local
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX>-regulationof angiotensin II induces immediate-early
        genes, which may leadto increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX> and
        myocardial hypertrophy or, alternatively,may up-regulate
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptotic proteins</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX>) incardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocytes</ENAMEX>. The initial increase in circulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">norepinephrineis</ENAMEX> thought to maintain cardiac function
        through inotropic mechanisms.However, a direct cardiac
        myocyte toxicity from norepinephrine iswell recognized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, pressure-overloadand stretch associated
        release of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angiotensin II</ENAMEX> has been shownto induce myocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] .In an elegant paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telger et al.</ENAMEX>,
        it has clearly been demonstratedthat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac hypertrophy</ENAMEX> is
        initially preceded by a wave of apoptosisof cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocytes</ENAMEX> followed by cell growth and a decrease in
        programmedcell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Apoptosis may,therefore, be
        the consequence of prolonged growth stimulation
        (adrenergicand renin-angiotensin axes) of adult cardiac
        myocytes, which areterminally differentiated. Similarly,
        certain cytokines (such astumor necrosis factor) can induce
        growth as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . As proposed by Telger
        et al. it isbecoming clear that cell growth and programmed
        cell death are infact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> linked processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX>, β-blocker therapy has become
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ofthe main treatment modalities for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>. Of
        particular interestis the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carvedilol</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvedilol</ENAMEX> is a novel multiple-action neurohormonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonist</ENAMEX>.Its primary activities are nonselective
        β-adrenoceptor blockade,vasodilatation (mediated through
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">α1</NUMEX>-adrenoceptor blockade), andantioxidant activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        In many clinical studies,carvedilol has been shown to
        improve left ventricular function andsymptoms in patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic heart disease</ENAMEX> or idiopathic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilatedcardiomyopathy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">andto</ENAMEX> dramatically
        reduce mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .However, it remains unclear how
        carvedilol improves ventricular functionin heart
        failure.
        In an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model of cardiomyopathy that has many
        similaritiesto human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, we tested the
        hypothesis that a reductionin apoptosis may be responsible
        for the beneficial effects of carvedilol.As such,
        attenuation of apoptosis in the myocardium may representa
        novel and important mechanism that contributes beneficial
        effects onthe myocardium.

          We have previously shown that removal of furazolidone

          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvedilol</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ventricular Function</ENAMEX>
          We investigated the effect of carvedilol by
          administering twodifferent dosages (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mg and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
          body weight per day) to controland DCM turkeys for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. We studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dosages (pharmacologicaland
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-pharmacological</ENAMEX>) as a difference in dose-dependency
          forcardiac function improvement has previously been
          demonstrated byus with another non-selective beta-blocker
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .Furthermore, we wanted to determine if carvedilol
          might exert beneficialeffects independent of heart rate
          effects. The lower dose (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/kg</ENAMEX>)did not reduce heart
          rate. However, the higher dose reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> byapproximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>.
          
          In vivo contractile performance of
          the heart was assessed bythe determination of fractional
          shortening of the left ventricle.As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1and
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, fractional shortening was increasedby <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> in DCM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and DCM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, respectively,compared to
          non-treated DCM <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (DCM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ). Comparedwith baseline values at
          the time of randomization, the improvementin fractional

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> inDCM 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated</ENAMEX> with improved cardiac
          function wasa reduction in the incidence of apoptotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> (see below).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> weight was significantly decreased in DCM

          to control) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This animal model is associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">withcachexia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Carvedilol</ENAMEX> treatment resulted in a slight
          gain of bodyweight, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> in the DCM 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> in the DCM

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ). Carvediloalso increased the body
          weight of control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).These data
          indicate a favorable effect on cachexia. In
          non-treatedDCM <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> the hearts weighed significantly
          less than control hearts(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). DCM <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated

          ratio was lower for carvediloltreated control animals
          compared to non-treated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.Left ventricle

          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carvedilol</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart Failure</ENAMEX>
          Model
          The furazolidone-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> model is a well
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">characterizedexperimental</ENAMEX> model of dilated cardiomyopathy
          with features verysimilar to those found in human heart
          failure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22</NUMEX> ] .Decreased contractile function
          (reduced fractional shortening ofthe left ventricle) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphological</ENAMEX> changes (increased heart volumes,left
          ventricular dilatation, and myocyte hypertrophy) are
          characteristic featuresof this model [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
          β-blocker treatment has emerged as an effective
          treatment modalityfor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>. Both in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, β-adrenergicblockade
          intervention appears to have beneficial effects on
          cardiacmyocyte function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 23 24</ENAMEX> ] . Of
          particularimportance, studies using carvedilol have shown
          remarkable improvementsin cardiac performance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 15</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] andreduction in mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .We have
          previously shown that propranolol, a nonselective
          β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>,is cardioprotective and prevents the
          development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failurein turkeys</ENAMEX> when given
          concurrently with furazolidone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Similarly,
          carteolol, a nonselective β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>,resulted in
          improvement in ejection fraction, reduction in
          ventricularvolumes, an increase in developed pressure as
          well as an increasein rate of survival in our turkey
          model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Improvementin cardiac function was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with cellular remodeling of cardiacmyocytes.
          Cardiac myocytes from hearts treated with a non-selective

          normal myocardial energetics,normal β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> receptor density as well as
          regression of myocytehypertrophy and reduced connective
          tissue content [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carteolol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hasbeen</ENAMEX> reported to prevent the development of

          In a canine modelwith left ventricular dysfunction
          produced by multiple sequentialintracoronary
          microembolizations, long term treatment with metoprolol,a
          β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> -selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blocker</ENAMEX>, has been
          reported to preventthe progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> systolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> dilatation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Similarly,
          our present findings onthe effect of carvedilol indicated
          improvement of left ventricularfunction and smaller LV
          volumes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Carvedilol</ENAMEX> prevented progressionof LV systolic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> dilatation as previously reportedin
          other models using β-blockers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 26</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> with dilated cardiomyopathy which received
          carvedilolshowed significant improvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> systolic
          function after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 weeks</TIMEX>.Notably, the improvement of LV
          systolic function in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treatedwith carvedilol was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a decrease of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> volumes comparedwith
          non-treated DCM <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, both doses of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carvedilolimproved LV</ENAMEX> contractile performance. Fractional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shortening</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>) wasincreased by an average of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 38%</NUMEX> and impressively by80<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> in some
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. These data seem to agree with the
          resultsof human clinical studies, and are suggestive that
          carvedilol notonly slows deterioration of cardiac
          function, but also improvescardiac function.
          The trend that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg body weight dose might not
          have beenwell tolerated was demonstrated by some animals
          becoming moribundfor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a short period</TIMEX> after dosing which
          might be due to a reductionin heart rate and cardiac
          output with resultant reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX>.We have
          previously shown a negative force-interval relationship
          (i.e.,negative treppe) in failing hearts with this model
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . This is in line with data from humanstudies,
          which showed that when first administered, β-blockers
          actually slowheart rate and diminish ejection fraction [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ] .The higher dose of carvedilol significantly reduced
          heart rate andblood pressure for up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> that tolerated thehigher dose did nevertheless
          benefit from the treatment. This issimilar to human
          clinical studies where greater benefit is derivedfrom
          higher dosages, if tolerated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Apoptosis in Animal Models of Heart Failure</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Heart failure</ENAMEX> is characterized by progressive
          deterioration ofglobal left ventricular function over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. The mechanisms responsiblefor the worsening of
          cardiac function are not clear. Loss of cardiacmyocytes
          has been suspected to be a feature of the
          cardiomyopathicprocess that contributes to progressive
          decline in left ventricularfunction and the development
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Evidence supporting
          the concept ofmyocyte apoptosis occurrence and
          contribution in the progressionof <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> has been
          obtained from a variety of observations,including

          We sought to evaluate the incidence and the extent of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> techniqueas a means of detection, we were able to
          document the occurrenceof apoptosis in ventricles from
          failing hearts, which was characterizedby a higher
          percentage of apoptotic nuclei when compared to controls
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.64%</NUMEX>vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.72%</NUMEX>). These apoptotic indexes are within the
          range of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">valuesin heart failure</ENAMEX> reported in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literature</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2% to 35%</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . The high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degreeof</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> reported in the literature in the
          magnitude of apoptosis maybe due to the diversity and
          specificity of methods used to quantifyapoptotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX>.
          When reporting apoptotic nuclei using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> assay,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> observationsshould be considered; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) although
          apoptosis occurred in our modelof <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, we might
          have missed, in random histologicalsections, evidence of
          apoptosis thereby under estimating the severityof
          programmed cell death due to the fact that apoptotic
          cells undergorapid phagocytosis with the entire process
          lasting less than twohours in some cell systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) apoptosisin the present study was evaluated at a
          single time point when theheart was still undergoing LV
          remodeling. Hence, the documentationof apoptosis at this
          stage may not reflect the true magnitude ofits occurrence
          during the initiation and transition to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>.In
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model of pressure-overload hypertrophy produced by
          aorticbanding, apoptosis appeared to peak at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>
          and gradually subsidedafter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> of aortic banding [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> ] .Therefore, a longitudinal study of apoptosis in
          failing hearts frominitiation to transition to failure is
          worth pursuing. In this way,the incidence of apoptosis
          can be documented as the heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">movesprogressively</ENAMEX> from
          normal to compensated hypertrophy and finallyto overt
          decompensated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were in
          compensated heartfailure and, often in the non-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, went into decompensatedheart failure when stressed
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">echocardiographic</TIMEX> examination.
          With improved cardiac function, there should be a
          reduction inactivation of the
          adrenergic-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">renin</NUMEX>-angiotensin axes as well as adecrease in
          activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokines</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumor-necrosis factor-α</ENAMEX>.In
          our model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, cardiac function correlated
          withthe incidence of apoptosis. As described in Table
          1and Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,there</TIMEX> were a higher number of apoptotic
          cells in hearts with a reductionin fractional shortening.
          In contrast, control hearts with normalventricular
          function showed low rates of apoptosis. The extent
          andoccurrence of apoptosis may partially explain the lack
          of an overallincrease in heart weight in hearts from
          non-treated DCM <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,despite a pronounced increase in
          heart size. These observations,and the results from
          several animal models, demonstrate that apoptoticcells
          are present in failing hearts, suggesting that apoptosis
          mightbe a mechanism involved, at least in part, in the
          progression ofheart failure and the reduction of myocyte
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carvedilol Inhibition</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptosis and Improvement</ENAMEX>
          of VentricularFunction
          The extent of apoptosis in cardiomyopathic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> was
          significantlyreduced by treatment with carvedilol. Both
          the lower and higherdoses of carvedilol were effective in
          decreasing the rate of apoptosis(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>
          reduction). This observation represents animportant
          finding in demonstrating the effectiveness of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiovasculardrug</ENAMEX> to protect against continual cardiac
          myocyte apoptosis in failinghearts 
          in vivo . Furthermore, the
          inhibition of apoptosisby carvedilol was accompanied by
          signs of improvement in left ventricularfunction and
          heart size (i.e. reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> volume) in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myopathicanimals</ENAMEX>. Whether the improved function, small
          heart size and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">decreasedwall stress</ENAMEX> were responsible for
          a reduction in apoptosis is notknown. However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">derived cardiac</ENAMEX> benefit was independent of heartrate
          effects because benefit was obtained at both dosages.
          Our data support the conclusions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossig et al.</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endothelialcells</ENAMEX>. They reported levels of apoptotic cells
          for control andNYHA <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III-IV</ENAMEX> hearts that were similar to
          our observations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . We similarly believe that the
          suppressionof apoptosis by carvedilol is likely due to
          its antioxidative propertiesrather than the β-blocking
          effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Webase this on our observation that a
          similar reduction in the incidenceof apoptosis was seen
          at both a non-pharmacological (no effect onheart rate or
          blood pressure) as well as a pharmacological doseof
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carvedilol</ENAMEX>. In a canine model of chronic heart failure
          producedby multiple sequential intracoronary
          embolizations, metprolol, a β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> selectiveblocker, reduced the
          incidence of apoptosis supporting our
          experimentalobservations with carvedilol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .The
          incidence of apoptosis was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.32 ± 0.77</NUMEX> in heart failure
          animalsthat were not treated which is similar to our
          findings of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.64 ±0.49</NUMEX> in hearts from untreated animals
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>. Recently,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li et al.</ENAMEX> have demonstrated
          that spontaneously hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>(SHR) with symptoms
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> had significantly higher levels
          ofapoptotic myocytes than control myocytes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .When
          treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor,
          thenumber of apoptotic cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHR</ENAMEX> with symptoms of
          heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">failurewas</ENAMEX> dramatically reduced to control levels;
          controls were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHR</ENAMEX> withoutsymptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
          . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kajstura et al.</ENAMEX>have also reported that angiotensin II
          increased the percentageof apoptotic cells in isolated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adult rat ventricular</ENAMEX> myocytes, andthis effect was
          mediated by AT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .Although ventricular
          function was not assessed in these studies,the
          observations raise the possibility that, like our
          findings withcarvedilol, the beneficial effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE-inhibitors</ENAMEX> or AT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> receptorblockers in heart failure
          may in part be attributed to an inhibitionof myocyte
          apoptosis with a resultant improvement in 
          in vivo cardiacfunction, a concept
          that needs further study.
          The data presented suggest that attenuation of
          apoptosis mayunderlie the beneficial effect of β-blockade
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ventricular</NUMEX> function,and that the inhibition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> can possibly lead to improvementin ventricular
          function. This represents a novel mechanism to slowthe
          progressive deterioration of myocardial function that can
          occurin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac failure</ENAMEX>. Because reactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen radicalsplay</ENAMEX> a role in inducing cell apoptosis [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] andthe potent antioxidant property of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carvedilol</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] , we speculate that the beneficial effectsattributed
          to carvedilol (i.e. inhibition of apoptosis and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">improvementof LV</ENAMEX> function) are mediated, in part, by its
          prevention of oxygen-derived freeradical damage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 40</NUMEX> ]
          . Our data supportsthis idea.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therapeutic Significance</ENAMEX>
          With the clear demonstration that cardiac myocyte
          apoptosis ispresent in our heart failure model strategies
          for prevention ofapoptosis can be tested. The clinical
          consensus has been that higherdoses of β-blockade should
          incur more benefits on ventricular remodeling.However,
          our studies demonstrated similar benefits at a
          therapeuticand sub-therapeutic dose. In light of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effect of carvedilolon the progression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, and its unique multi-actionsthat are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> by any other β-blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> or by any otheragent
          currently used in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, our
          findingsrepresent an important new mechanism of improved
          cardiac function.
          The development of animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> in
          which apoptosisis an important feature will allow the
          modulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> deathpathways through targeted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. Understanding the roleof specific
          signaling pathways in cardiac myocyte apoptosis
          anddeveloping strategies to manipulate these
          intracellular pathwaysmay provide in the near future
          novel therapeutic approaches forthe management of heart
          failure.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, our model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, which shows a
        highlevel of congruence with the human condition, has been
        shown tohave a high level of apoptosis that corresponds
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac failure</ENAMEX>.Carvedilol, a non-selective β-blocker
        with α-blocking propertiesas well as antioxidant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, significantly reduced the incidenceof
        programmed cell death while improving cardiac function.
        Thiseffect was independent of heart rate lowering effects,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e. β</ENAMEX>-blockade.The beneficial effects of carvedilol can
        therefore be obtained withsubtherapeutic doses. This is a
        novel observation and importantin treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who may
        not tolerate higher doses (heart rateand blood pressure
        lowering) of carvedilol. The apoptotic processis linked to
        the development and progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure aswell</ENAMEX> as
        the improvement in cardiac function seen with
        β-blockade.

          However, the higher doseof <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">carvedilol</ENAMEX> resulted in a
