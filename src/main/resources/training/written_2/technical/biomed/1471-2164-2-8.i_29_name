        The proper assembly of basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with nucleic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, such as occurs in the packaging of histones with DNA
        to produce chromatin and in the packaging of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with rRNA to form ribosomes, is a reaction that
        must be facilitated so as to prevent the aggregation of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oppositely</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of molecules. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> that
        mediate these reactions, generally termed molecular (or
        nuclear) chaperones, have been identified biochemically.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> studied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that participate in the processes
        of chromatin and ribosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> are nucleoplasmin and
        nucleophosmin, respectively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose
        characteristic acidic domains have been shown to bind the
        basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in these processes and present them
        to the nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nucleoplasmin</ENAMEX> is the most abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the 
        Xenopus oocyte nucleus and is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> for which the term molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX> was coined
        due to its multiple roles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of nucleosomes
        during early frog development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nucleoplasmin</ENAMEX> forms a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pentamer</ENAMEX> and its stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acidic residues</ENAMEX> bind to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H2A</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H2B</TIMEX>. In concert with the unrelated acidic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein N1/N2</ENAMEX>, which binds histones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H3 and H4</TIMEX>, they act
        together and with other factors to assemble nucleosomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ] . In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, nucleoplasmin and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in the chromatin remodeling and
        nucleosome disassembly that occurs, for example, during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> to allow the access of transcription factors
        to nucleosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Another major function of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleoplasmin</ENAMEX> is the decondensation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm chromatin</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX>. In this case, nucleoplasmin acts to exchange
        the sperm specific basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which allow the dense
        packing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>, with the histones <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H2A and H2B</TIMEX>,
        thus effecting chromatin decondensation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Phosphorylation of nucleoplasmin appears to be important in
        regulating this activity, as heavily phosphorylated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleoplasmin</ENAMEX> is significantly more active [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nucleophosmin</ENAMEX> (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B23</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NO38</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">numatrin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> related to nucleoplasmin, is
        implicated in ribosome assembly due to its abundance,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> in the nucleolus and its multiple activities
        that are consistent with such a function. Some of these
        activities include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ,
        ribonuclease activity (for processing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preribosomal RNA</ENAMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] and association with maturing preribosomal
        ribonucleoprotein particles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . It may also be
        involved in the transport of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> or other nucleosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> across the nuclear membrane, as it is known to
        shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus and to stimulate
        the nuclear importation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nucleophosmin</ENAMEX> also appears to be intimately involved in
        centrosome duplication. It associates specifically with
        unduplicated centrosomes, and its phosphorylation by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK-2/cyclin E</ENAMEX>, the trigger for centrosome duplication, is
        required for duplication to occur [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The
        nucleophosmin gene is also known for its fusion with the
        anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALK</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase in
        cases of this disease with (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p23</TIMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">q35</ENAMEX>) translocations [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . The nucleophosmin portion contributes to
        transformation by providing a dimerization domain, which
        allows activation of the fused kinase and signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        We previously discovered and initially characterized a
        novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the mouse, namely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin 3</ENAMEX> ( 
        Npm3 ). To identify the human
        ortholog of 
        Npm3 and begin its characterization,
        we have cloned a human 
        NPM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX>, determined its genomic
        structure and relationship to other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and show
        its expression in multiple tissues and subcellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> in the nucleus.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          NPM3cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cloning</ENAMEX> and genomic structure
          Mouse 
          Npm3 is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 5</NUMEX> kb
          upstream of the 
          Fgf8 gene in the same
          transcriptional orientation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . To determine if
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> 
          NPM3 is similarly located and to
          identify genomic clones of 
          NPM3, we analyzed FGF8-containing
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic lambda</ENAMEX> clones [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blotting
          using a mouse 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Npm3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA probe</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>-kb 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hin d III</ENAMEX>- 
          Xho I fragment that hybridized to 
          Npm3 was identified, subcloned and
          used to screen a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cDNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. Several
          partial cDNAs with strong sequence homology to mouse 
          Npm3 were isolated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' coding
          region was subsequently isolated using a reverse
          transcriptase-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> approach and was fused to one of the
          partial cDNAs at a common restriction site to produce a
          cDNA with full coding potential. Sequencing of subcloned
          genomic fragments and comparison with the cDNA sequence
          allowed us to construct an exon map of the 
          NPM3 gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). 
          NPM3 has the same exon structure as
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse ortholog</ENAMEX> and is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 5.5 kb</NUMEX>
          upstream of 
          FGF8, in the same transcriptional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The 
          NPM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exon</ENAMEX>/intron boundaries and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> information is presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Based
          on its close linkage to 
          FGF8, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX> maps to chromosome
          10q24-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          NPM3sequence analysis
          The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence deduced</ENAMEX> from the human 
          NPM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> sequence was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>
          identical and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> similar to mouse 
          Npm3 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The human sequence
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> longer than that of the mouse; these
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> lie in the acidic domain in the
          C-terminal portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least eight</NUMEX>
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX> and threonine phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
          present in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involving such kinases as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">casein kinase I and II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, glycogen
          synthase kinase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and calmodulin-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). All of these consensus sites are also
          found in mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Npm3</ENAMEX> with the exception of the casein
          kinase I site at residue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>. A cluster of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> that is rich in basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycines</ENAMEX> forms a potential nuclear localization signal [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] in the human as well as the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Multiple phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and nuclear
          localization signals, or the ability to bind proteins
          with such signals, are also characteristics of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleophosmin</ENAMEX> and nucleoplasmin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . When
          the functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPM3</ENAMEX> are elucidated, it will be of
          interest to determine the contribution of phosphorylation
          to these activities, since the functions of both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleoplasmin</ENAMEX> and nucleophosmin are regulated by
          phosphorylation, which is extensive in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] ).
          To enable an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> comparison between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX> with
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleophosmin</ENAMEX>/nucleoplasmin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>,
          we searched the nonredundant GenBank database using human
          NPM3, 
          Xenopus nucleoplasmin and human
          nucleophosmin as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> queries, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">full-length proteins</ENAMEX> were retrieved (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). An amino
          acid comparison of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX> with these other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from various metazoans
          reveals extensive sequence identities and similarities
          throughout all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX> except the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> residues
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have a core region
          of relatively close similarity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. C-terminal to this region, all have one or
          more acidic domains consisting of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> to more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> aspartic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamic acid residues</ENAMEX> per
          molecule. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> can comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25%</NUMEX>
          of the total amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>;
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX> they make up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 18%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal core region of high similarity between
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> correlates to a region in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">nucleophosmin/B23</ENAMEX> that has been shown to be involved in
          oligomerization as well as chaperone activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . A
          central portion between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleophosmin</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> acidic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> is required for ribonuclease activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] ;
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> does not have a corresponding domain in
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NPM3</ENAMEX> or nucleoplasmin, suggesting that these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> would lack such activity. A nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> binding
          domain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of nucleophosmin is also lacking
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX> and nucleoplasmin, but the known functions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleoplasmin</ENAMEX> in nucleosome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and sperm
          decondensation suggest that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and possibly
          NPM3, can accomplish intermolecular reactions involving
          nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in other ways, perhaps by associating with
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have this binding activity. Indeed,
          NO29, a 
          Xenopus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with significant
          similarity to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX>, is found to associate with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NO38</TIMEX>, the 
          Xenopus ortholog of mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleophosmin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          To gain further insight into the relationship of NPM3
          with the other known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, we used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTAL W</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TreeTop</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] to produce a dendrogram of
          these relationships (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In this analysis, we
          included the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3together</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          other histone-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are unrelated to this
          family. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Xenopus N1/N2</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and human NASP
          (nuclear autoantigenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm protein</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , are
          closely related to each other and may be orthologs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ]
          . This analysis shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NPM3</ENAMEX> is more closely related
          to NO29 and the nucleoplasmins from 
          Xenopus than to the nucleophosmins
          from multiple species. No nucleoplasmin ortholog in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> has been reported to date, and our screening of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> has not detected such a sequence. The
          relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">N1/N2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASP</ENAMEX> can be seen in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dendrogram</ENAMEX> and appears similar in closeness to that of
          NPM3 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NO29</TIMEX>. The kinship of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPM3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NO29</ENAMEX> is supported
          by recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> screens with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NPM3</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> query against the entire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nonredundant GenBank</ENAMEX> database, which resulted in NO29
          sequences as the best non<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-NPM3</NUMEX> match, and vice versa.
          Although other genomic and functional studies would be
          required to prove an orthologous relationship between
          NPM3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NO29</ENAMEX>, they appear by several analyses to share a
          relatively close evolutionary history and as such could
          be considered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> orthologs.
        
        
          NPM3 expression in human tissues
          We examined the expression of 
          NPM3 in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> human tissues by
          Northern blot analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Abundant and
          relatively equal expression of 
          NPM3 was found in all tissues with
          the highest levels, relative to actin, in pancreas and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testis</ENAMEX> and the lowest in lung. Previous analysis of 
          Npm3 expression in mouse tissues
          also showed generally equal and strong expression in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> tested with especially strong expression in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . However, in the mouse, the brain, rather
          than the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, displayed the lowest 
          Npm3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels. Nevertheless, the
          widespread and relatively strong expression of the gene
          in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has a
          fundamental function(s) in cells of many, if not all,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. The apparently ubiquitous expression and
          abundant levels of 
          NPM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> are consistent with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and with a proposed role as a
          molecular chaperone.
        
        
          NPM3 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> localizes to the nucleus
          All of the nucleophosmin and nucleoplasmin homologs
          that have been studied to date are localized in the
          nucleus. To allow a determination of the subcellular
          localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPM3 protein</ENAMEX>, we tagged the protein
          at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> with a hemagglutinin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) epitope. We
          then expressed this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NIH3T3</NUMEX> cells, fractionated
          the cells into nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular
          (culture medium) fractions and analyzed these by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblotting</ENAMEX> using an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HA antibody</ENAMEX>. This analysis
          revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NPM3</ENAMEX> was localized only in the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fraction</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPM3 protein migrated</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels as a doublet with apparent molecular masses
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 and 27</NUMEX> kDa, which are larger than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.5</NUMEX> kDa mass
          predicted by the deduced amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence including
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX> tag. Similarly, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> also migrate more
          slowly than expected: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NO29</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">migrates</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> kDa
          versus the expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NO38</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">migrates</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> kDa
          versus the expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] , and 
          Xenopus nucleoplasmin migrates at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">38 kDa</TIMEX> rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kDa</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The slower migration
          is likely primarily due to an electrophoretic anomaly
          reflecting the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid composition</ENAMEX>, although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> or other modifications could conceivably
          contribute. Supporting this notion, the 
          in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">transcription</ENAMEX>/translation
          of a plasmid encoding the closely related NO29 protein
          produces a product, presumably unmodified, with slow
          mobility that is similar to the mobility of NO29
          extracted from cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . The smaller-sized
          polypeptide of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NPM3</NUMEX> doublet is probably a degradation
          product, as is observed in analyses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NO29 protein</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> ] . This subcellular localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX>, together
          with the other results here, suggests that this protein
          is a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX> with functions in the
          nucleus.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The striking similarities in amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> and
        domain structure between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NPM3</TIMEX> and its chaperone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleophosmin</ENAMEX> and nucleoplasmin, together with abundant
        expression levels and nuclear localization, strongly
        suggests that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">NPM3</NUMEX> shares fundamental nuclear chaperone
        functions with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It will be important in
        future work to refine these results and test, for example,
        whether NPM3 may have chromatin or ribosome assembly
        functions that are similar or complementary to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleoplasmin</ENAMEX> or nucleophosmin, or whether it may have
        completely independent functions.
