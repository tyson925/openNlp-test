        After lung, prostate, and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> ranks as a leading source of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        Nationally, although death rates have been declining since
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1980s</TIMEX>, this trend is not consistent across all
        ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] Specifically, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</TIMEX> the
        death rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX> has been decreasing at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nearly</TIMEX>
        twice the rate as that for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX>, and for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> the rate has actually been increasing. [ 3
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ] Among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Filipinos</ENAMEX> suffer
        a higher death rate than do the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] These
        ethnic disparities appear largely driven by differential
        stage distribution (e.g., more advanced stage cases at
        presentation). Underutilization of cancer screening appears
        a key factor. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] However, studies have found that even
        after controlling for stage at diagnosis, significant
        ethnic differences remain. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        How can one explain cancer survival differences that
        persist after adjustment for stage? Biological theories
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of certain ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are
        genetically predisposed to more aggressive forms of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, differ in host-tumor interactions, or are more
        likely to have contributing comorbid conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wudel et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>) recently reported that colorectal cancer
        survival differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> could not be explained by measurable differences
        in treatment. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuhausen</ENAMEX> has proposed a
        multi-factorial biology-utilization model. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        Environmental theories propose that behavioral or
        socioeconomic factors leading to differential utilization
        of medical care are responsible. Varying utilization of, as
        well as access to health care has been reported as an
        explanation. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schrijvers et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) have
        described a relation between socioeconomic status and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comorbidity</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] Evidence of interaction between age and
        socioeconomic status has also been reported. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>'s diverse ethnic composition combined with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">long-standing</ENAMEX> statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> registry, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaii Tumor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Registry</ENAMEX> (HTR), offer an ideal setting for examining ethnic
        differences in cancer survival. Previous research has
        documented significant survival disparities among the major
        ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura et al.</ENAMEX> found that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one-third</NUMEX> higher survival
        rate than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hirohata et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>)
        described better survival rates among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and
        Caucasians than among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Filipinos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawaiians</ENAMEX>, even after
        adjusting for age, gender, and extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> at
        diagnosis. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wegner et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>) analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX> data
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1960-1974</TIMEX> and found the same pattern of differences,
        which also could not be explained by any of the available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariates</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        The goal of the present study is to examine trends in
        recent survival rates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX> data that was incorporated
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wegner</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>) study is still available as is more
        recent data <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to the year 2000</TIMEX>, allowing for an
        examination of survival patterns over time. Improved
        survival rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were observed by Hinds
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>) during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1960-1974</TIMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] More
        recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maskarinec et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) have described improved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> survival among all ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970-1990</TIMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] Also, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1995-1998</TIMEX> it was
        found that all ethnic disparities in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> survival
        were eliminated once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM Stage</ENAMEX> had been controlled. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        These findings largely fail to support purely biologic
        explanations of disparate colorectal cancer survival.
        Differential utilization of health care or access to health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> appears more important.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, the passage of time has brought general
        improvements in medical care and also narrowed disparities
        in access to medical care. Utilization of screening
        procedures continues to vary among ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, however.
        At the onset of this study, we hypothesized that, over the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 30 years</TIMEX>, improved cancer screening and treatment, as
        well as better access to medical care across all ethnic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> has both improved survival rates and reduced ethnic
        differences in colorectal cancer survival. We further
        predicted that stage at diagnosis, age, and gender could
        explain most remaining survival differences, although we
        questioned the role of other factors such as treatment
        utilization and co-morbid disease.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Population</ENAMEX> and Sample
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> resides on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> islands with
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oahu</ENAMEX> and is estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2 million</NUMEX>
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 580,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> of
          residents are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years and older</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX> and
          older. The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pacific Islander</ENAMEX> descent: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.1%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.8%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>, and the rest other ethnic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. However, over the period of this study,
          differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> distribution within various ethnic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> have driven some differences in the
          actual proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
          All data were ascertained through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaii Tumor</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Registry</ENAMEX> (HTR), which provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based coverage
          of all newly diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases and subsequent
          follow-up status for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX> was
          established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> and it became part of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surveillance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiology</ENAMEX>, and End Results (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEER</ENAMEX>)
          program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>. Quality control reviews have shown that
          case-ascertainment through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX> is virtually complete.
          Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cases reported to the registry are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histologically</ENAMEX> confirmed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 2%</NUMEX> of cases
          are identified through death certificates only. Whenever
          possible, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX> follows cases until death through
          regular linkages with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaii Department of Health</ENAMEX>'s
          death records, hospital-based registries, and additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of mortality information. In accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEER</ENAMEX>
          rules, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> of cases are lost to follow-up. The
          ethnicity classification in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX> is based on
          self-reports by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Information on the first course
          of treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and
          hormone therapy) is also collected. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
          From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> diagnosed with colorectal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICD-O-2</ENAMEX> codes: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C18.0-C18.9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C19.9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C20.9</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C21.0-C21.2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C21.8</ENAMEX>) from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960-2000</TIMEX> were extracted. Of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,416</NUMEX> pathologically confirmed cases of invasive
          colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, we excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">757</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were not
          from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> major ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for
          whom the diagnosis date was unknown, leaving a total
          sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,424</NUMEX> cases for analysis.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analyses</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were first examined for ethnic differences by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX> across stage at diagnosis, age, sex, and cause of
          death using the likelihood ratio χ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2statistic</TIMEX>. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX> is interpreted in the same manner as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson χ 2</ENAMEX>, but provides greater precision. Next, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> procedure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHREG</ENAMEX>, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] which performs regression
          analyses based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards model, was
          used to conduct survival analyses. As a test of the
          validity of the proportional hazards assumption (that the
          hazard ratio does not change over time), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
          proportional hazards regression was performed with a
          variable calculated as the mean deviated natural log of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. Significance of this variable would imply a
          violation of the proportional hazards assumption.
          Survival (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> function) estimates (used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX>)
          were based on the fitted proportional hazards model, and
          can be interpreted as the estimates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>
          functions controlling for the effects of the covariates.
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] The same analyses were conducted in each of three
          separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> determined by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of diagnosis:
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960-1974, 1975-1987</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988-2000</TIMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cohort were chosen to be consistent with the study
          conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wegner et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          The starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cohort was chosen as
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> because that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> staging
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (tumor size, node status, and metastases) became
          available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> stage data, a
          comparison between the predictive value of this more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> form of staging (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">0, I, IIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIA</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SEER</ENAMEX> staging (local, regional,
          distant) could be made. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] The was accomplished by
          computing the increment in model fit after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> stage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> had been added to model containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEER</ENAMEX>
          stage variable. The likelihood ratio statistic provides
          this information and is distributed as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>,
          allowing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of statistical significance.
          The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> consisted simply of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and three</NUMEX>.
          Within each cohort <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of survival analyses were
          performed: In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, an event was considered to have
          occurred if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> died as a result of colorectal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>; in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, death by any other cause was
          considered an event. This allowed for an assessment of
          whether or not changing colorectal cancer survival trends
          were consistent with general survival trends. Censored
          values included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> alive at the last data
          collection and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> lost to follow-up. In all
          analyses the effect of ethnicity on survival, while
          controlling for the variables stage at diagnosis (local,
          regional, distant), age, sex, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of diagnosis (to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for any linear time trends existing within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohorts</ENAMEX>), was assessed using a hierarchical approach in
          which a model including ethnicity was compared to one
          that did not. Age and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of diagnosis were treated as
          continuous variables, as examinations did not reveal any
          nonlinear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>.

        distribution data for stage at diagnosis, age, sex, and

        When an event was considered death by colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,

        examination of the confidence intervals for cohort <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        significantly longer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> survival than <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> cohort, the confidence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX> had a significantly
        longer survival time than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Filipinos</ENAMEX>; and in the third
        cohort, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> had significantly shorter survival time
        than all other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. When an event was considered
        any death not caused by colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, significant
        ethnic differences were again found for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Likelihood Ratio χ</ENAMEX> 2(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73.3</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57.9</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < .0001</ENAMEX> for all]. Confidence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> always had a
        significantly higher survival rate than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ethnic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        Results were largely consistent with our hypothesis, but
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major exception: the persistently low <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX>
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> survival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cohort 3</TIMEX>. This unpredicted
        finding led to post hoc analyses that were identical to the
        previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, but included the available
        treatment variables (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and
        hormone therapy) as additional predictors. Table 5provides
        the percentages of each ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> receiving a given
        treatment by stage. With the inclusion of treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, ethnic differences were no longer significant in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cohort, but remained significant in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Likelihood Ratio χ</ENAMEX> 2(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29.1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.2</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < .0001</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < .0001</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.08</NUMEX> respectively]. See Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        Additionally, we tested the post hoc hypothesis that
        Hawaiians have lower survival because they were both
        younger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage than the
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. If advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is more aggressive in
        young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, this could explain why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> had
        lower survival. An interaction term between age and stage
        at diagnosis was created and added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> run
        previously. However this interaction term did not show
        statistical significance, failing to support the post hoc
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
        At least for cohort <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, our data also allowed us to
        compare the predictive value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SEER</ENAMEX> staging variable
        (local, region, and distant) with that of the more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive TNM</ENAMEX> staging variable. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TNM</ENAMEX> staging provided
        significantly improved predictive value over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SEER</ENAMEX> staging
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Likelihood Ratio χ</ENAMEX> 2(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126.4</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < .0001</ENAMEX>]. However, inclusion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TNM</ENAMEX> staging did not eliminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> ethnic disparity
        in outcome [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Likelihood Ratio χ</ENAMEX> 2(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.7</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p < .05</ENAMEX>], again suggesting that
        stage at diagnosis alone does not account for the
        persistently low survival among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        With few exceptions, results clearly supported the
        stated hypothesis that ethnic disparities in colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> survival have been diminishing over time. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
        showing the convergence of survival over time, best
        exemplifies this. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> discrepancy in this overall trend
        is the unchanged life expectancy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cohort 3</ENAMEX>. A comparison with the survival curves for other
        causes of death within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cohort 3</TIMEX> reveals that this effect is
        specific to colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and does not reflect a
        general tendency for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> to die sooner.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation for this is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> were
        not utilizing medical care to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX> to
        the same degree as other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Our post hoc
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> did demonstrate that ethnic disparities were no
        longer statistically significant after controlling for
        treatment differences. Interestingly, however, Hawaiians
        did not appear to be receiving less treatment; and with
        respect to chemotherapy and radiation, appear to have been
        receiving more than the other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible
        explanation for this is that treatment is causing adverse
        effects and death. Another is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> see prognostic
        signs of severe disease that are not measured by our
        covariates, and therefore prescribe more treatment. That
        is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> may have more advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> than staging
        alone indicates.
        The implications of these findings are important. If
        differential screening constitutes the primary reason for
        ethnic survival disparities, it should be possible to
        achieve equally favorable outcomes in all ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        With the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX>, the evidence presented
        here reflects a convergence in terms of screening, medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, and colorectal cancer survival among all ethnic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Further efforts are needed to examine why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawaiians</ENAMEX>
        do not follow the overall trend, and how to make
        improvements. In this regard, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiian</ENAMEX> cancer
        network called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imi Hale</ENAMEX> is attempting, along with
        support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>, to increase
        screening for colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Hawaiians</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
        ]
        One limitation of this study is that data are restricted
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. However, even though there are
        clearly potential regional differences in ethnic patterns
        of survival, the results of this study could be important
        beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. For example, in national studies, it has
        been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> are less likely than
        others to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
        Differential treatment utilization may drive ethnic outcome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disparities</ENAMEX>. The role of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> choice and the
        role of complicating co-morbid conditions in treatment
        selection probably play some role, and another limitation
        of our study is not having access to this information. In
        future studies, however, we hope to elucidate the impact of
        such factors.
        To this end, an important area for future research is
        detailed analysis of specific treatments received by cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For example, beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> (the start of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cohort in the present study) colorectal cancer
        survival has been improved through the use of
        5-fluorouracil-leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
        This factor, as well as improving stage distribution
        through screening, has undoubtedly contributed to the
        greatly improved colorectal cancer survival rates in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> cohort. Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTR</ENAMEX> does not provide
        adequate detail with respect to specific chemotherapy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatments</ENAMEX>, so this hypothesis could not be examined here.
        However, future studies incorporating expanded data sources
        should examine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> have been receiving
        adjuvant 5-FU-leucovorin to the same degree as others, and
        if not, why not (e.g., access, informed choice with refusal
        of recommended treatment, or co-morbid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>).
        Conversely, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> receive apparently similar
        adjuvant therapy (i.e., same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, dosage, number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courses</ENAMEX>, etc.), do they benefit to the same degree as
        others? Also, do they show a similar degree of treatment
        compliance? These issues may be of particular relevance,
        because results from this study suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX> are
        equally likely, if not more likely, to receive
        treatments.
        Hawaiians have been reported to have relatively high
        rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, renal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular disease</ENAMEX>, and tend to
        be afflicted at a younger age. Perhaps an interaction
        between cancer treatment and comorbid conditions is having
        a negative effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiians</ENAMEX>. We speculate that co-morbid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> might play a role in treatment selection for some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX>. Collection of ICD-9
        diagnosis codes from non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> with appropriate
        record linkage would allow us to study this.
        Other results from this study indicate that age at
        diagnosis is another significant predictor of survival,
        with older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> having a shorter life expectancy
        after diagnosis. However, a comparison of hazard ratios by
        cause of death showed that the values were much lower for
        death due to colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> than for other causes. This
        suggests that, while age is clearly related to overall
        survival, it is less relevant to colorectal cancer
        survival. That is, colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is not more deadly for
        older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> than for younger ones. Similarly, sex
        appears to predict colorectal cancer survival. A small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> effect was observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> when considering
        death due to colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, but a strong effect when
        considering death due to other causes. The impact of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-morbid disease on survival might explain these age and
        gender differentials.
        Stage at diagnosis represents the most important
        prognostic variable. In this study the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SEER</ENAMEX> staging system
        was used so that identical analyses could be performed
        across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>. However, for the most recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cohort 3</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNM</ENAMEX> staging clearly improved survival
        predictions over the less comprehensive SEER staging. In
        future studies, we will use TNM staging whenever
        possible.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study provided longitudinal evidence in support of
        non-biologic explanations for ethnic disparities in
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> survival. Specifically, the present
        analysis suggests that observed ethnic differences result
        from differential screening. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, ethnic disparities
        in colorectal cancer survival have narrowed considerably
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 30 years</TIMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> did not
        experience the same degree of improvement in survival as
        the other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
