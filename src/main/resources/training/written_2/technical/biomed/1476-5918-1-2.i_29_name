        Aging has been associated with decreased function and
        exercise performance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Decreased exercise
        performance has been related to decreased oxidative
        capacity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] and decreased muscle mass [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and function due to aging could
        also contribute to decreased exercise performance through
        impaired blood flow [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Decreased capillary density [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] and a thickening of vascular walls [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] are present with
        aging.
        Vascular function is altered with aging and may
        influence muscle blood flow and exercise performance.
        Altered vascular function in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is evidenced
        as impaired endothelial function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] , an altered
        ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endothelin receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , and/or altered
        reactivity of the smooth muscle to sympathetic activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . Reduced endothelial function is related to impaired
        formation and decreased activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX>
        ] and is particularly prominent in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        evidence of cardiovascular disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
        , or obesity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, aging does not appear
        to effect endothelium independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vasodilation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 14</NUMEX> ]
        .
        These structural and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alterations</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> may explain age associated reductions in
        muscle blood flow. Decreased leg blood flow and vascular
        conductance are present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> compared to young
        subjects during whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> exercise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] and in response
        to reactive hyperemia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Decreased basal limb blood
        flow was related to increased vasoconstriction in the
        elderly compared to younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . However,
        not all studies have shown age related changes in blood
        flow. Resting blood flow and post exercise hyperemia was
        similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> compared to younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Blood flow responses to single limb exercise have also been
        preserved in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . Discrepancies in
        aging effects on muscle blood flow may be due to the use of
        active [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] or inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In addition, it
        is not clear whether the age related changes in blood flow
        were a result of reduced cardiac output during whole body
        exercise or reduced local vascular capacity. These
        inconsistent findings of reduced blood flow in older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> suggest that other age-associated factors are
        involved.
        Physical activity status influences vascular function
        and may explain alterations in muscle blood flow. Exercise
        training increases cardiac output during exercise and
        increases skeletal muscle blood flow in response to
        reactive hyperemia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Arterial diameters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 24</NUMEX> ] ,
        capillary density [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 25</ENAMEX> ] , vascular reactivity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ]
        , and endothelial function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 28</ENAMEX> ] are improved with
        training and reduced with inactivity.
        The purpose of this study was to determine if aging had
        an influence on muscle blood flow independent of habitual
        physical activity levels. Specifically, we examined single
        leg blood flow in response to reactive hyperemia with
        active and inactive older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in comparison to active
        and inactive young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. We tested the hypothesis that
        aging would result in reductions in limb blood flow
        independent of physical activity.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Subjects
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> participated in the study between
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages of 20 and 81 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were divided into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Active</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YA</ENAMEX>) (mean = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>),
          Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inactive</ENAMEX> (YI) (mean = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), Older
          Active (OA) (mean = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), and Older Inactive
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OI</ENAMEX>) (mean = <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were classified
          as active if they reported participating in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> of
          moderate intensity exercise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times a week
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous six months</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> classified as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> reported no regular physical exercise. All
          subjects reported no history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or other
          confounding factors. The physical characteristics of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The study was conducted
          with the approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Georgia</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Protocol
          Subjects rested in a supine position for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-15 minutes</TIMEX>
          prior to testing. Resting blood pressure was obtained.
          Ischemia was induced in the lower limb by inflation of a
          blood pressure cuff <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 mmHg</NUMEX> above systolic blood
          pressure measured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. Blood flow was measured at
          rest and in response to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> of cuff ischemia. Cuff
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placement</ENAMEX> was distal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Doppler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and was placed
          directly above the knee. Cuff inflation and deflation was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-2 seconds</TIMEX>) using a rapid inflation device (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.E.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokanson, Inc</ENAMEX>). Blood pressure was measured continuously
          to measure changes during the test as a result of cuff
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finapres, Ohmeda</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Blood Flow
          Blood flow was measured continuously in the common
          femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> using quantitative Doppler ultrasound
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric LogiQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">400</ENAMEX> CL) with a frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulsed Doppler</ENAMEX> ultrasound was recorded using an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">insonation</ENAMEX> angle of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">45°-60°</ENAMEX>. The velocity gate was set to
          include the entire arterial diameter. Doppler waveforms
          were analyzed to determine the time average maximum
          velocity by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX>'s advanced vascular program
          software. B-mode images were measured during diastole to
          determine vessel diameter. Peak systolic blood flow was
          calculated as the product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> cross sectional
          area and time average maximal velocity. Blood flow
          response to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> of cuff ischemia was an index of
          peak blood flow response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Conductance was
          calculated by dividing the maximal blood flow by the mean
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterial</ENAMEX> pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> time to recovery was
          determined as the time where blood flow dropped to one
          half the magnitudes between maximum flow and resting flow
          values.
        
        
          Near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Infrared Spectroscopy</ENAMEX> (NIRS)
          Muscle oxygen delivery was determined by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time
          of recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen saturation</ENAMEX> after cuff ischemia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Oxygen saturation</ENAMEX> was measured using a continuous
          light source, dual wavelength NIRS device (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CW2000</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIM, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>). The probe contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small
          tungsten filament lamps, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 cm</NUMEX> apart which emit white
          light, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> photo detectors with filters for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">760</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850</NUMEX> nm light located between the lights. Brief flashes of
          light migrated through the tissue and were collected by
          the detectors at wavelengths set by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> optical filters.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxyhemoglobin</ENAMEX> has a greater absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850</NUMEX> nm compared
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">760</NUMEX> nm, with deoxyhemoglobin absorbing more at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">760</NUMEX>
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850</NUMEX> nm. The difference between the signal at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">760</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">850</NUMEX> nm was used as the index of relative oxygen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Leg volume
          Leg volume measurements were determined by Doppler
          ultrasound measurements of fat thickness and by
          circumference measurements of the lower leg. Subcutaneous
          fat was determined by B-mode images of the thickness
          between skin and muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fascia</ENAMEX>. Measurements were
          attained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every three centimeters</NUMEX> over the Medial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gastrocnemius</ENAMEX> and over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterior Tibialis</ENAMEX> muscles.
          Based on the circumference and fat measurements total
          leg, fat, and lean area volume, were calculated.
        
        
          Analysis
          An analysis of variance (ANOVA) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.0</NUMEX>)
          was conducted to test for aging and activity effects as
          well as to test for differences by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> was
          analyzed to verify normality and to test for any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX>. Analyses were conducted at a significance level
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Baseline data
          Subjects in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had higher resting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> blood pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>), diastolic blood
          pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.012</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>), and heart rate (p
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.013</NUMEX>) compared to the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). There
          were no differences in blood pressure or heart rate with
          physical activity level. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lean</ENAMEX> leg volume was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> lower in
          the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> compared to the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.049</NUMEX>), despite a lack of difference in height, or body
          weight. When comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> separately, MAP
          was higher in the older inactive compared to young
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX>). The older inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had
          a higher systolic blood pressure compared to the young
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that approached significance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.084</NUMEX>).
          Resting heart rate was lower in the young active group
          compared to both of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,32</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.561</NUMEX>, p
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.010</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Η 2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.243</NUMEX>). Resting femoral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> diameter as
          well as resting normalized blood flow and resting
          conductance were not different on aging or activity
          effects or on differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Cuff ischemia
          The cuff occlusion protocol was not associated with
          any changes in heart rate or blood pressure. There was a
          greater time averaged maximal blood flow in the younger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2180 ± 590 ml/min vs. 1700 ± 570 ml/min</ENAMEX>, for
          young versus older, respectively; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,35</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.986</NUMEX>, p =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.020</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Η 2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.154</NUMEX>) and active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2220 ± 640 ml/min</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">versus 1680 ± 470 ml/min</ENAMEX>, for active versus inactive,
          respectively; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,35</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.015</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.008</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Η 2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.195</NUMEX>).
          The maximal blood flow was different between groups
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,35</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.764</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Η 2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.358</NUMEX>) with the young
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> having higher blood flow than the young
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.047</NUMEX>) and the old inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (p
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          When maximal blood flow was normalized to estimated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lean</ENAMEX> muscle mass there was a higher blood flow in the
          active compared to inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,33</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.690</NUMEX>, p

          age effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maximal</ENAMEX> blood flow when normalized to lean
          muscle mass was different between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> groups
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,33</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.784</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Η 2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.374</NUMEX>) with the young

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.031</NUMEX>) and the old inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.005</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Conductance of normalized maximal blood
          flow was greater in the young (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,33</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.513</NUMEX>, p =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Η 2</NUMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.253</NUMEX>) and the active (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,33</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.011</NUMEX>, p =

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maximal</ENAMEX> blood flow had a slower return to resting
          values (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time to recovery) in the older groups
          compared to the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,35</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.684</NUMEX>, p =

          of blood flow was not different between the active and
          inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> time to recovery approached
          significance between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,35</NUMEX>) = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.406</NUMEX>, p

          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> saturation measured with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIRS</ENAMEX> was not different
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, although the older inactive group
          appeared to have slower recovery values (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The purpose of this study was to determine if aging or
        activity had an effect on peripheral blood flow. The
        primary finding of this study was that peak blood flow
        capacity was related to activity level while there was no
        age effect independent of activity level. Our results are
        consistent with others which have reported no age-related
        changes in maximal flow capacity after exercise [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX>
        ] . A strength of this study was that maximal blood flow
        capacity was normalized to estimated lean muscle mass, to
        correct for age-related decreases in muscle mass [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        We did not find age related changes in resting blood
        flow or resting diameter. In contrast, other studies have
        found age-related changes in resting blood flow which have
        been attributed to increases in sympathetic tone [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 30</NUMEX> ]
        . Aging has been associated with reduced blood flow and
        vascular conductance during whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> exercise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        The reduction in blood flow and conductance have been
        related to alterations in cardiac output and blood volume
        due to aging [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Several of our resting blood flow
        variables approached significance (p values below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.10</NUMEX>)
        indicating that our results may have been significant with
        a larger sample size. However, the significance of age
        related changes in resting blood flow are unclear other
        than serving as a marker for altered sympathetic tone;
        especially if maximal blood flow capacity is not changed
        with age.
        We found that our active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had greater maximal
        blood flow capacity (≈ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>) than our inactive subjects
        regardless of age. Consistent with our results <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin et</ENAMEX>
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] reported a greater vasodilatory capacity in
        trained than untrained subjects independent of age.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inactivity</ENAMEX> has been associated with impaired efficiency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peripheral oxygen</ENAMEX> extraction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] and reduced blood flow
        after cuff ischemia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Conversely, exercise training
        results in greater maximal flow capacity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 34</NUMEX> ] .
        Regular aerobic exercise also prevents the age-associated
        loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">endothelium</TIMEX> dependent vasodilation maintaining
        maximal flow capacity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Our findings support previous
        research that maximal flow capacity is maintained by
        aerobic exercise and is independent of age.
        Because blood flow is dependent on perfusion pressure,
        blood flow data is often presented as conductance (flow
        divided by mean arterial pressure). This is important in
        aging studies as age is associated with increases in blood
        pressure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 30</NUMEX> ] . We found that maximal conductance was
        reduced in our older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, consistent with a higher
        mean arterial pressure in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. We also found
        higher maximal conductance in the young active group
        compared to the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inactive subjects</ENAMEX>, again explained by
        differences in mean arterial pressure. Another study has
        reported aging to be associated with reduced conductance [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] . However, it is unclear how important differences in
        maximal conductance between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is when there is no
        difference in maximal blood flow. The lack of difference in
        blood flow suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> delivery is not compromised
        despite the reduced conductance. It is possible that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> system in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> has compensated for
        the higher mean arterial pressures.
        Consistent with the lack of age differences in maximal
        blood flow, we found no age differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> delivery
        as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIRS</ENAMEX>. Oxygen delivery after exercise has
        been found to be similar between healthy active older and
        younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . It was expected, however, that
        oxygen delivery would be different between the active and
        inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inactive</ENAMEX> did appear to have
        prolonged oxygen delivery but the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inactive</ENAMEX> did not.
        This suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> delivery may be more sensitive to
        the interaction of age and inactivity. Future studies are
        needed to clarify the influence of age and activity level
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> delivery.
        An interesting finding in this study was that the half
        time to recovery of blood flow was prolonged (≈ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>) in the
        older compared to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, independent of activity
        status. This is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> studies to our knowledge
        that has investigated blood flow recovery kinetics in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Slow recovery of blood flow has been used as
        an index of reduced vascular reactivity in coronary
        arteries [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The hyperemic response to ischemia is
        dependent on the presence and response to metabolic factors
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vasoactive substances</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenosine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The prolonged recovery of blood flow in
        our study could be due to either a greater buildup of
        metabolic factors/vasoactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> and/or a diminished
        ability to remove them in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. This study,
        however, was not designed to determine the mechanism for
        the increased time for blood flow to recover. A prolonged
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time to recovery has been associated with a decreased
        nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> and prostanoid production [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and a loss of
        endothelium dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vasodilation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Reduced vascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivity</ENAMEX> is associated with many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with aging [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . We did not find
        activity effects on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time to recovery. This finding
        contrasts other previously published studies which have
        shown decreased vascular reactivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are
        required to be on bed rest [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 38</NUMEX> ] and in individuals
        with spinal cord injuries [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . It is possible that the
        differences in activity levels between our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in this
        study were not large enough to produce the same effects
        that are seen with bed rest and spinal cord injury.
        In summary, we found that maximal blood flow capacity
        was significantly related to activity level but was not
        related to age. Blood flow calculated as conductance was
        related to aging and activity, consistent with the reduced
        blood flow in the inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and the higher blood
        pressures in the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. In addition, the older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had evidence of reduced vascular reactivity, as
        measured by prolonged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time to recovery, independent of
        activity status. The prolonged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time to recovery in the
        older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> is likely related to a reduced vascular
        reactivity associated with increased cardiovascular disease
        risk. Thus, maximal flow capacity and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time to
        recovery of blood flow are influenced by different
        mechanisms in young and older active and inactive
        subjects.
