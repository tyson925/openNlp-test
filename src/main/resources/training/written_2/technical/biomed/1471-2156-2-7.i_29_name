        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pima Indians</ENAMEX> have a very high prevalence for type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX> (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes
        mellitus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDDM</ENAMEX>) with evidence of strong familial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is
        a major risk factor for the development of the disease [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>], and maximal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> action (i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> disposal rate
        at pharmacological <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels) was found to be
        determined by a co-dominantly inherited autosomal gene [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. Initially, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bogardus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> observed an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> and linkage between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance and red
        cell antigens on chromosome 4q [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. After the analysis of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">128 sib-</TIMEX>pairs using quantitative trait sib-pair analysis,
        they observed a significant linkage between maximal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        action and the intestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid-binding protein</ENAMEX> 2
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FABP2</NUMEX>) gene and the annexin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ANX5</NUMEX>) gene on chromosome 4q
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        It is well recognized that fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid metabolism</ENAMEX> is
        linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Intestinal FABP2
        contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single ligand binding</NUMEX> site that displays a high
        affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Because it is a candidate
        gene at this locus, a search for a mutation was initiated
        and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alanine</ENAMEX> (GCT) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Threonine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX>) polymorphism at
        codon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> was identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pima</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The
        associations between this polymorphism and fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat oxidation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> uptake
        during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were identified
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic Pima Indians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDDM</ENAMEX> is a genetic disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and results
        from an imbalance between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> and beta cell
        function, we hypothesized that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism of the
        FABP2 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance, which is one of the key determinants for the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDDM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> is
        affected by hypertension [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>] and abnormal glucose
        tolerance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], we examined the relationship of this
        polymorphism with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> healthy and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">normotensive Caucasians</ENAMEX> with normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerance</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        The clinical features of the studied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were shown
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Using the PCR-RFLP assay, we identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> AA,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> AT, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the
        allele frequency was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> for the A allele and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> for the T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX>. The distribution of genotypes was in compliance
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy-Weinberg</ENAMEX> equilibrium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8321</NUMEX>).
        Since there were only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, they were pooled
        with the AT subjects during the analysis. There were no
        differences in clinical features between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genotypic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (AA vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT/TT</ENAMEX>) as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Although the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT/TT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a higher fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma insulin</ENAMEX>
        concentration than the AA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0444</NUMEX>), no
        differences were noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting plasma glucose</ENAMEX>
        concentrations and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">postchallenged plasma glucose</ENAMEX> and
        insulin concentrations. We estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>) and beta cell function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%B</ENAMEX>) using the average of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting plasma glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> concentrations.
        While no difference was noted in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT/TT</ENAMEX> subjects
        were more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistant (a lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>) than the AA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0461</NUMEX>).
        Since a higher body mass index had been reported to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with this polymorphism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], we were concerned
        that the observed differences could be the result of other
        confounding covariates. A multivariate analysis was
        performed to examine the influence of this polymorphism and
        other covariates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This polymorphism and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass
        index explained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28.7%</NUMEX> of the variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX> and this
        polymorphism was an independent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">determinant of %</NUMEX>S (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0434</NUMEX>). However, this polymorphism had no impact on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B.
        Age, gender and waist hip ratio accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19.5%</NUMEX> of the
        variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%B.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Discussions
        In this study, we found that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FABP2</NUMEX> was associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance and
        accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3%</NUMEX> of the variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">%S. Multivariate</ENAMEX>
        analysis confirmed that this polymorphism was an
        independent risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance. In
        contrast, this polymorphism had no impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">%B. Our</ENAMEX>
        observations confirm that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism of the
        FABP2 affects <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, which was previously
        reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pima Indian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>].
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FABP2</NUMEX> locus has been studied extensively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNS</ENAMEX> red
        cell antigens, one of the few genetic markers available at
        that time, were initially found to be linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic Pima Indians</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> using a sib-pair analysis and they were also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX> non-diabetic Pima
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. With additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and additional
        genetic markers, a significant linkage was identified
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the FABP2 and ANX5</TIMEX> loci on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4q</NUMEX> with
        insulin resistance in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic subjects</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
        nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, the linkage of the
        FABP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> postchallenged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin concentration</ENAMEX>) was also found in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, which is genetically related to the Pima
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. However, sib-pair analysis failed to detect
        any linkage of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FABP2</NUMEX> locus or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A54T</TIMEX> polymorphism
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> related phenotypes in other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>] as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4A</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, no linkage was
        found between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FABP2</NUMEX> locus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4B</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>], lipodystrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], or obesity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. As
        shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4C</ENAMEX>, the population association studies of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FABP2</NUMEX> locus with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>/impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerance
        were negative in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Subsequently, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism was
        identified and was found to be associated with increased
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid binding protein</ENAMEX>, increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat oxidation</ENAMEX> and
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pima Indians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population association</ENAMEX> studies of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDDM</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX> ] ], coronary artery disease [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>], obesity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] were also
        essentially negative. Positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were mostly
        observed in quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies as shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4D</ENAMEX>. In addition to the original positive association
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the A54T</TIMEX> polymorphism and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting plasma insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat oxidation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose uptake</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-diabetic Pima Indians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was
        also found with obesity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>], <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> post-challenged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin concentration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], and various lipid metabolism [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] ]. In the present study, we also
        demonstrated a positive quantitative association between
        this polymorphism and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>S. However, numerous negative
        studies were also noted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 29</TIMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33</NUMEX> ] ].
        Clearly there is substantial controversy surrounding
        this locus and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism in the pathogenesis of
        insulin resistance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T2DM</ENAMEX> as described above.
        Disagreement also occurred in the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pima Indian</ENAMEX>
        study. Although significant linkages were identified at the
        FABP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> with fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0004</NUMEX>)
        and with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose uptake</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0008</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pima Indians</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>], the differences regarding the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism with
        fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> concentrations (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.04</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uptake</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.04</NUMEX>) were only marginally significant in
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The significant linkage in the
        original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sib-pair</ENAMEX> study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] could be the combined results
        of a highly polymorphic marker of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FABP2</NUMEX> locus (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> alleles for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A54T</TIMEX> polymorphism) and less
        intrafamilial difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity as the
        result of familial clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>. In
        contrast, the marginal difference reflected a very modest
        influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pima Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which is consistent with our
        observation that this polymorphism only accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3%</NUMEX>
        of the variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is neither
        necessary nor sufficient for the development of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2DM</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
        this polymorphism has only a very modest influence on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) beta cell dysfunction, on which
        this polymorphism has no influence in the present study,
        plays a key role in the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overt diabetes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>],
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> association studies and linkage studies are
        not able to detect the interaction between this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenotype</ENAMEX>. In contrast,
        quantitative studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>-related phenotypes become
        more rewarding in detecting a polymorphism of a very modest
        effect as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4D</ENAMEX>. The negative quantitative
        studies could be the result of other confounding factors,
        such as the inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic</ENAMEX>, impaired glucose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerant</ENAMEX> or hypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the study. Therefore,
        we only enrolled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerant</ENAMEX> and normotensive subjects
        in the present study for the reasons described
        previously.
        The most convincing evidence that supports the A54T
        polymorphism as a causal mutation is from a functional
        study of mutated FABP2 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. FABP2 plays a role in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> and intracellular transportation of dietary
        long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Thr54-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FABP2</ENAMEX> has a
        twofold greater affinity for long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> than
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ala54-containing FABP2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. As predicted by the
        proposed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>] and subsequently proven [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randle</ENAMEX>'s
        cycle", an increased concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> inhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose uptake</ENAMEX> in muscle and results in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance.
        Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> interventional studies showed that this
        A54T polymorphism affected lipid metabolism during
        interventions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>], as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4E</ENAMEX>.
        In summary, we examined the role of the A54T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerant</ENAMEX> and normotensive healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasians</ENAMEX>. We
        found that this polymorphism had an independent, but very
        modest influence (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3%</NUMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>), which
        was assessed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HOMA</ENAMEX>. However, it had no impact on beta
        cell function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%B</ENAMEX>). To our knowledge, this is the very
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report of a positive association between this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity in a Caucasian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> and Methods
        
          Subjects
          Through the advertisement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> newspaper of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without a prior
          history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> were invited to
          participate in the study. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were
          receiving medical treatment on a regular basis. Subjects
          were instructed to fast for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 14 hours</TIMEX> before the
          study visit. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of the visit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Clinical Research Center</ENAMEX> of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> as outpatients. An indwelling angiocatheter
          was inserted into an antecubital vein. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had
          fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> drawn at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-15</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-10</NUMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-5 minutes</TIMEX>.
          A blood sample for the fasting lipid profile was obtained
          at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-15 minutes</TIMEX>. Fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          concentrations were calculated as the average of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fasting samples. After an oral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gm glucose</ENAMEX>, postchallenged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were drawn at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60, 90</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 minutes</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          measurements. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          enrolled in the study. They were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> tolerant
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting plasma glucose</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX> mM, interval plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">glucose < 11.1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM</ENAMEX>), and normotensive (systolic blood pressure < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mmHg</ENAMEX> and diastolic blood pressure <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 90 mmHg</NUMEX>). Plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> concentrations were assayed as
          described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>) and
          beta-cell function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%B</ENAMEX>) were estimated based on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeostasis Model Assessment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HOMA</ENAMEX>) as described
          elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>]. They were calculated from the
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting plasma glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (mM and mU<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX>, respectively) using the
          following formulae: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>S = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22.5</NUMEX> / (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin x glucose</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%B</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">x insulin</ENAMEX> / (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>). The study was
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> and written
          informed consents were obtained at the entry of the study
          from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>. We confirm that the study has
          complied with the recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helsinki</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Genotyping
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from peripheral leukocytes
          using the method described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. A polymerase
          chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR-RFLP</ENAMEX>) assay was developed for genotyping. The
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment flanking the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A54T</NUMEX> polymorphism was
          amplified using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primers flanking exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the FABP2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTACCGAGTTTTCTTCCCACC</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AATTAAACCATCCAATGAAATAGAGC</ENAMEX>. Polymerase chain reaction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>) was carried out in an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11-Î</NUMEX>¼l reaction volume
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> pM of each primer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> mM dNTP, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> glycerol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.275</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> Taq
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 mM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KC1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tris-HCl</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX>. The region of interest was amplified by
          an initial denaturation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> cycles
          of denaturation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">94Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, annealing at 60Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, and extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 seconds</TIMEX>, and
          concluded with a final extension at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX>.
          Then, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">375</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs) was
          digested in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-Î</NUMEX>¼l reaction volume containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> of Hha
          I (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Biolabs Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
          with the buffer supplied by the vender. The digested PCR
          products were resolved on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.0%</NUMEX> agarose gels. Hha I
          digested the wild type, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alanine</ENAMEX> (GCT), which yielded two
          products, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 and 175</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs (A allele). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> to A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Threonine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX>) destroyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hha I</ENAMEX> site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Variables</ENAMEX>, which failed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Normality</ENAMEX> test, were
          logarithmically transformed before analysis. They were
          age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, waist-hip ratio, plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B. The relationship between the
          variables and parameters of interest (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>B <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">or %</NUMEX>S) was
          determined by using univariate analysis. A multivariate
          analysis using a stepwise-regression strategy was
          employed to examine the effect of covariates on the
          parameter of interest (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%S and %B</ENAMEX>). The continuous
          covariates were age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, waist-hip ratio,
          and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The
          categorical covariates were gender and the FABP2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX>. Backward stepwise option with
          alpha-to-enter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> and alpha-to-remove of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> was
          employed to exclude covariates that had much less or no
          influence on the parameter under analysis, one at a time
          starting from the one had least impact, which was based
          on the p value (the highest p value). Stepwise regression
          analysis was stopped when all the p values of all
          covariates, that were examined, were less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>.
          Since a very close linear relationship was noted between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> and diastolic pressure (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3586</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.0001</NUMEX>) and also between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index and waist-hip
          ratio (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3014</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>), they were removed
          from the multivariate analysis based on their p values as
          indicated in each analysis. A nominal P value of less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was considered significant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYSTAT</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.0</NUMEX> for
          Windows from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>) was used for
          the statistical analysis.
