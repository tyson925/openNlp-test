        Pathologic classification of tumors has been
        traditionally based on microscopic appearance. Although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> often correlates with natural history of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, tumors of a given pattern may have a broad
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prognostic</ENAMEX> range and different responses to treatment.
        Molecular methods, such as the evaluation of hormone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX>, have been effectively
        employed to further characterize tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Nucleic
        acid array-based technologies extend molecular
        characterization by providing a biochemical snapshot, or
        profile, of cellular activity that encompasses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Potential applications beyond
        diagnosis and prognosis are diverse, and include treatment
        response stratification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in clinical trials,
        assessment of relevance to human safety of drug-associated
        tumors in animal carcinogenicity studies, and the
        development of more pertinent animal xenograft models of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> therapy. Successful application of array-based tools
        depends on establishing robust <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and computational
        methods that effectively and reliably discriminate between
        tumor types. Recent reports have demonstrated the power of
        such tools to distinguish between clinically meaningful
        subsets of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Renal cell carcinoma (RCCa) represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 3%</NUMEX>
        of all human malignancies with an incidence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> per
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> present
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic disease</ENAMEX> and a further <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> will develop
        distant metastases during the postoperative course. The
        most effective therapy for RCCa localized to the kidney is
        surgery and a metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> is practically incurable.
        There is a low response to biological modifiers and the
        treatment is generally only palliative [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        We evaluated the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> expression profiles of renal cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> (RCCa) using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Affymetrix GeneChip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>,
        comparing mRNA expression profiles from a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> human
        tissue samples and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pooled samples. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> samples
        consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> normal kidneys, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> clear cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chromophobe carcinomas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX>), one
        urothelial carcinoma and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> metanephric adenoma.
        Expression profiles from a pilot data set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> samples
        were analyzed using multiple clustering algorithms. Genes
        were then selected from the pilot data set using a
        fold-change criteria or from all of the normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
        samples using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value. Genes that were identified from
        both the pilot and the complete data set were categorized
        according to a hierarchical classification scheme based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> attributes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoded proteins</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Clustering of the pilot data set
          The gene expression data from a pilot data set that
          consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ten samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 - 4</TIMEX>, consisting of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> normals, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pooled samples) were
          analyzed using hierarchical clustering to identify
          structure within the data set. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pooled samples</ENAMEX> were
          included to determine whether a combined sample yielded
          an expression profile representative of the individual
          samples. To determine the relatedness of the samples,
          clustering analysis was performed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> different
          clustering algorithms using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> methods of
          pre-processing the data sets were applied to identify the
          most consistent sample-clustering pattern. The rationale
          behind this approach was to avoid the bias inherent in
          any single clustering method and to determine the most
          appropriate clustering method for this data type. Genes
          that were considered "present" above background by the
          Affymetrix software in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the samples were
          included in the analyses. This reduced the data set to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4571</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> per sample. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> sample clusters were
          evaluated to see if their dendrograms fitted the expected
          sample biology (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The most consistent cluster
          dendrogram, present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> analyses, did indeed
          match the sample biology (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) and for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of these
          analyses a logarithmic transformation was used. In the
          consensus dendrogram, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> normal
          samples each clustered in separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Interestingly,
          the dendrogram suggested that the expression pattern of
          the normal samples was more similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> than to the
          Chr samples. As expected, the pooled normal sample
          clustered with the normal kidney samples. The pooled
          tumor sample clustered more closely to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> than to the
          Chr, possibly due to the greater similarity between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, and consequent weighting of the pooled sample
          toward the more uniform <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> expression profile.
        
        
          Clustering of the complete data set
          To expand our data set we obtained a further <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> human
          tissue samples (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-20</TIMEX>), including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kidneys</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> kidney tumors. These were profiled in
          the same manner as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 10</TIMEX> samples. From this
          combined data set (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>) we selected genes
          classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Present</ENAMEX> (see Methods) at least once (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5372</TIMEX>
          genes) and then clustered the log-transformed data with
          average linkage analysis. This method had previously
          produced a dendrogram that matched the expected sample
          biology in the pilot data set. The sample dendrogram
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) showed that the relatedness of the samples
          was similar to that observed with the pilot data set. As
          seen previously in the pilot data set the normal samples
          clustered together off a single node. However the Chr
          also clustered off this node and now appeared more
          similar to normal samples than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> included in
          the pilot data set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 4</TIMEX>) now clustered
          within a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that include the additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
          samples. From this node there also appeared to be two
          outlier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 and 20</TIMEX>). Pathology reports
          on these samples revealed that these were not RCCa
          samples but instead patient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> was a papillary urothelial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX> and the sample from patient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> was not a
          carcinoma but a benign metanephric adenoma.
          There were distinct patterns visible in the gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> that were conserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>,
          zone C), or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chr samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, zone B), or the
          normal kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, zone A). These patterns
          indicated that each subtype of tumor expressed a common
          set of genes that could be selected and further
          characterized. The urothelial carcinoma and metanephric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenoma</ENAMEX> appeared to share few of these genes commonly
          regulated between the other tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Functional taxonomy: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes differentially</ENAMEX> regulated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and Chr
          To select genes that were changed between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and Chr
          in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> data set we used an arbitrary cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          fold-change <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in combination with the Affymetrix
          difference call (see Methods). Genes were selected
          according to criteria described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, which lists
          the number of selected genes in each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> categories.
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">456</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were selected by these criteria.
          In order to understand the molecular differences
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC RCCa</ENAMEX> on a broader scale, we developed
          a gene categorization system ("<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Functional Taxonomy</ENAMEX>," see
          Methods) in which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were hierarchically grouped
          according to the cellular function of their protein
          products. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> primary
          category was tallied and plotted to generate a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-level "signature" (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The functional
          taxonomy signature provided a graphical method to rapidly
          visualize broad gene expression characteristics of the
          tumors. The cellular function categories that contained
          the largest number of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">456</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transduction</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellular</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix Organization</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adhesion</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolism</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unclassified</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> samples
          demonstrated differences in the numbers or patterns of
          increased and decreased genes in these categories and
          their subcategories. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost twice as many</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX>
          Transduction were increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chr</ENAMEX>; a
          similar number were decreased in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. Within
          Cellular and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix Organization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adhesion</ENAMEX>, the
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly four</NUMEX> times as many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
          increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chr</ENAMEX>, which decreased
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> times as many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcategorization</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>) revealed a predominance of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes coding</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>)
          and cellular adhesion molecules (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) that were
          increased in expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Functional taxonomy: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes differentially</ENAMEX> regulated
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
          To determine the difference between normal kidney
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> we used a rigorous statistical
          approach based upon a calculated p-value (see methods)
          and the combined data set consisting of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight normal</TIMEX>
          kidney samples and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>. We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142</NUMEX>
          genes that were significantly upregulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> compared
          to normal kidneys and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">213</NUMEX> that were significantly down
          regulated. To determine the biological
          significance/function of these genes we used Functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxonomy</ENAMEX> to classify them into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> cellular groupings
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> level signature showed similar
          trends to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> comparison (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          categories that contained the most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transduction</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellular</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix Organization</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adhesion</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolism</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>), and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unclassified</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). These were the same categories
          that showed the most gene changes in the pilot data set.
          Subcategorization of both categories showed trends within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> that were similar to those observed in the
          pilot data set. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal Transduction</ENAMEX> category
          there were many genes associated with ligands, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
          and cytosolic factors (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Band Table 4</ENAMEX>). Gene
          expression changes within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellular Matrix</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adhesion</ENAMEX> category were focused on
          extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix genes</ENAMEX> and cellular adhesion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Cand Table 5</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry
          The selected gene lists were reviewed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that
          corresponded to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that could be evaluated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX>. The data sets revealed that mRNA
          transcripts for CD <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> (PECAM) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell</ENAMEX> receptor
          beta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> were increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chr</ENAMEX>. Since
          antibodies to CD <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> and CD 3 (which forms a complex with
          the T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>) are reactive in fixed tissues, we
          used them to stain the tumors. CD <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> was present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> in
          a prominent dense branching network of fine vessels
          surrounding the tumor cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1E</NUMEX>). In contrast, Chr
          had few CD <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>-positive vessels present (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1F</NUMEX>). CD 3
          stained numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> scattered throughout the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> tumors (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1G</NUMEX>). These were not initially apparent
          in the hematoxylin and eosin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, probably due to
          the similarity in size and appearance of the tumor cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> and the lymphocytes. In contrast, there were
          almost no T cells in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> tumors (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1H</NUMEX>). These
          results indicated concordance between the mRNA expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX> and the pathobiology of the RCCa tumor
          sub-types.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Expression profiling of kidney tumors using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Affymetrix GeneChip</ENAMEX> distinctly separated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different
        tumors from each other, as well as from normal kidney
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX>. This finding is consistent with the morphologic,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">karyotypic</ENAMEX> and clinical outcome differences between these
        tumor types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . There are many sample-clustering
        methods that may be applied to expression microarray data,
        none of which can be conclusively called "correct", since
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> makes different assumptions regarding the
        nature of the data. We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> clustering methods combined
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> ways of pre-processing the data sets to
        eliminate, or at least reduce bias in a pilot data set. The
        smaller pilot data set was used to simplify the
        interpretation of the results. A common cluster dendrogram
        was produced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> methods; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of these were from the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> that employed logarithmic transformation of the data
        sets. The pattern was consistent with the biology of the
        sample with normal kidney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC and Chr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> each grouping
        together (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). That a logarithmic transformation
        gave the most meaningful cluster dendrograms is consistent
        with the distribution of the untransformed expression data
        being skewed to the left because the majority of genes have
        low expression levels. Standardization of the data assigns
        equal weight to each gene and, hence, increases the
        contribution of unreliable low expression genes. The use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">logarithmic</ENAMEX> transformation, on the other hand, improves the
        spread of the data so the distribution is close to normal.
        It also re-adjusts the weight for each gene. For example,
        genes with high expression levels, which might be
        unreliable or biased due to saturation, will have lower
        weights in distance calculation. Therefore, the logarithmic
        transformation improves the calculation of distance for the
        subsequential clustering algorithms and leads to uncovering
        the biological meaningful pattern within the data.
        A comparison of the dendrograms from the pilot data set
        and complete data set reveals some surprising changes. In
        general the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dendrogram</ENAMEX> remained the
        same, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> and normal kidney all grouped separately.
        However, in the pilot data set the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> were more similar to
        normal kidney than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chr</ENAMEX>, while in the complete data set Chr
        were more similar to normal kidney. It is unclear why this
        larger data set changed the dendrogram and suggests that
        the subtle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the dendrogram was not as robust as
        it appeared. With fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chr</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> it is not
        possible to draw any strong conclusions about relatedness
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> samples.
        In order to visualize the functional patterns associated
        with a particular set of selected genes we used a simple,
        semi-hierarchical system to categorize genes according to
        the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> they encode, that we call
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Functional Taxonomy</ENAMEX>. There are challenges associated with
        the partly subjective nature of categorization of gene
        function, such as where to place a single gene product that
        is involved in several cellular tasks. Ideally, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">categorization</ENAMEX> should consider multiple attributes of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. To this end, we propose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> complementary
        classification schemes: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) biochemical function, which
        categorizes according to molecular activity; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) cellular
        function, which categorizes according to biological role at
        a cellular level; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) tissue function, which categorizes
        according to anatomic or organ system location. In this
        paper we have visualized profiling results using the second
        of these schemes (cellular function) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> levels:
        primary categories, secondary categories, and individual
        genes (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and 4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4and 5</ENAMEX>). We have found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Functional Taxonomy</ENAMEX> to be a useful visualization tool for
        understanding the differences in gene expression patterns
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> tumors. This system is similar in
        concept to what is currently being developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontology Consortium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        The cellular function signatures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Chr
        revealed that the greatest number of gene expression
        changes for both tumor types occurred in the categories of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal Transduction, Cellular</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix Organization</ENAMEX> and
        Adhesion, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metabolism</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with current
        theories of neoplasia, which hypothesize that tumor cells
        modify their signaling pathways, establish new contacts
        with an altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>, and refashion their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">metabolic</ENAMEX> machinery.
        There exists considerable literature on the expressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and gene products associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCCa</ENAMEX>. Using the
        selected gene sets from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3and</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values and
        fold-change values calculated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> normal kidneys
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, we looked for concordance between our results
        and published reports. The genes 
        CA 9 ( 
        carbonic anhydrase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX> ), 
        CCND1 ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> ), 
        CDH2 ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-Cadherin</ENAMEX> ), 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> ( 
        epidermal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> )
        and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFA</ENAMEX> ( 
        tranforming growth factor alpha ) all
        showed increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> expression that matched the
        literature and had p-values â‰¤ 0.0061 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        The observed decrease in 
        CDH1 ( 
        E-cadherin ) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0045</NUMEX>)
        also matched previously published reports, as did the
        decrease in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIM</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vimentin</ENAMEX> ) expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr RCCa</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 16</NUMEX> ] . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIM</ENAMEX> was also found to be increased in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0045</NUMEX>, which was consistent with the
        literature. We detected a small increase in expression of 
        ICAM1 ( 
        intercellular adhesion molecule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> )
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fold</ENAMEX>-change = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0081</NUMEX>), which was also
        consistent with the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        The expression results for the genes 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JUN</ENAMEX> ( 
        c-jun ) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHL</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Hippel-Lindau</ENAMEX> ) did not match the
        literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . Nor did the result for 
        KRT7 ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cytokeratin 7</ENAMEX> ), which has been shown
        to be overexpressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chr</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Instead we found 
        KRT7 to be strongly repressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
        (fold-change = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-5.1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0009</NUMEX>). Yet, expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid microarrays</ENAMEX> does not
        necessarily correlate with other forms of analysis for all
        genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . This may be especially true when altered
        expression of a gene is reported to be present in a subset
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of tumors, since a small sample number (as
        are the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chr samples</ENAMEX> in this study) may not include the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alteration</ENAMEX>.
        In the case of CD <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> and the T cell receptor beta <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>,
        expression profiling results were concordant with
        immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors. The prevalence
        of the scattered T cells within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> tumors was somewhat
        surprising, but entirely consistent with the biology of
        response to a treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCCa</ENAMEX>, interleukin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-2</NUMEX>),
        since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-2</TIMEX> activates lymphocytes against the tumor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ]
        .
        During preparation of this manuscript, an expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">profiling</ENAMEX> study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> renal neoplasms (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        oncocytomas, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX>) was reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . This study
        employed a different platform (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Incyte</ENAMEX> glass slide cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>) and hybridization method (competitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>/normal binding), and used related but not identical
        gene selection criteria (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fold-change in expression
        versus normal kidney in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> tumors).
        The study identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">189</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were differentially
        expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> tumors, and this gene set was
        also able to distinguish between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX> tumor types. We
        suspect that a greater number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chr</ENAMEX>-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> would
        have been selected in their study had there been at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, since a gene altered in expression only in
        the single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX>, but not in any of the oncocytomas or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, would not have been identified by the selection
        criteria.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The results of the present study demonstrate the power
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChip</ENAMEX> expression profiling to
        differentiate between morphologically distinct tissues that
        are descended from a common organ. In addition, they
        demonstrate the value of functional cataloging selected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and visualizing the result in a graphical format.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Sample isolation, histology and
          immunohistochemistry
          Renal cell carcinoma (RCCa) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were collected
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing radical nephrectomy at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan Medical Center</ENAMEX>. All samples and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> clinical data were obtained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX> approval. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> tissue samples
          (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight normal kidneys and 13 tumors</TIMEX>) were obtained from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> ranged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 to 83 years</TIMEX>
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were diagnosed with clear cell carcinomas (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> with chromophobe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinomas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chr</ENAMEX>), one with a
          papillary urothelial carcinoma, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a
          metanephric adenoma. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the
          resection specimens included unaffected kidney (termed
          "normal kidney") as well as tumor tissue. Tissue samples
          were fixed in formalin, or were immediately frozen at
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80Â°C</NUMEX> in optimal cutting temperature embedding medium
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">OCT, Sakura</ENAMEX>). Cryostat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were prepared to confirm
          suitability for profiling (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Aand 1B</ENAMEX>); only
          viable-appearing tissues were processed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> was taken
          to ensure that normal tissue was not contaminated with
          tumor tissue and vice versa. Normal kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          uniformly taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal cortex</ENAMEX>. Paraffin-embedded
          tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
          diagnostic evaluation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative morphologies</ENAMEX> are
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1Cand 1D</TIMEX>. Immunohistochemical stains were
          performed on fixed tissues. Sections were deparaffinized,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rehydrated</ENAMEX> and treated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX>. Stains
          were performed using an automated avidin-biotin complex
          method according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol (Nexes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IHC Staining System</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ventana Medical Systems</ENAMEX>), with
          details as indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolation
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from each sample (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight normal</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kidneys</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> tumors). In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pooled samples</ENAMEX> were
          made by mixing equal quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the kidney
          samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 - 4</TIMEX> together, and by mixing equal
          quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> RCCa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> also from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 - 4</TIMEX>. The frozen tissues were warmed briefly,
          allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCT</ENAMEX> compound to soften slightly so that it
          could be rapidly dissected away without the tissues
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thawing</ENAMEX>. The tissues were then pulverized using a frozen
          steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and hammer. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted using Trizol
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA labeling</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> hybridization
          Biotinylated target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 Î¼g</NUMEX> of
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> protocol. Labeled cRNA was
          hybridized on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HuGeneFL Affymetrix</ENAMEX> GeneChip
          Â®containing probes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 5600</TIMEX> mRNAs
          corresponding to genes of known sequence. Each
          hybridization included control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA transcripts</ENAMEX>. The
          hybridization reactions were processed and scanned
          according to standard Affymetrix protocols.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix Microarray Suite and Data Mining Tool</ENAMEX>
          were used to calculate average difference (gene
          expression) values, fold-change values and difference
          calls from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> fluorescent intensity data. All
          GeneChips were normalized to avoid differences in
          fluorescent intensity as described in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manual</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.1</NUMEX>) . The average intensity of each
          gene chip was scaled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>, where average intensity was
          calculated by averaging all the gene expression values of
          every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> set on the array excluding the highest and
          lowest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of the values. If the scaling factor did not
          fall <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 0.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneChip</ENAMEX> data was not used.
          Fold-change values were calculated as the ratio of gene
          expression values between each tumor-normal sample pair
          from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, with the normal sample values used
          as the baseline. The difference call was calculated using
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> variables: the number of probes pairs that have
          changed in a certain direction, the ratio of increased
          probe pairs over decreased probe pairs, the log average
          ratio change, and the difference in the number of probe
          pairs changed (either positive or negative). The default
          values (explained in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix Manual</ENAMEX> ) were used in
          the difference call decision matrix. The resulting data
          sets were manipulated and filtered in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Access</ENAMEX>
          according to various criteria (see results) for selection
          of genes that showed altered expression in the
          tumors.
          For the pilot data set, sample clusters were prepared
          using the software program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>)
          on the gene expression values. The following clustering
          algorithms were used: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hierarchical clustering
          methods (single linkage, average linkage, complete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">linkage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX>'s minimum variance, density linkage,
          centroid, and flexible-beta), a k-mean method, and an
          oblique principle component method employing either (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          Pearson correlation or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) Spearman correlation based on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rank</ENAMEX>. Negative values were set equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> sets
          were processed as follows for the clustering analysis:
          unchanged (raw data), log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> transformation, standardization to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0,1</NUMEX>), and a combination of both log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> transformation and standardization
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0,1</NUMEX>). This yielded a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> sample cluster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dendrograms</ENAMEX>. For the complete data set (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> samples plus
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pooled samples) gene and sample clusters were
          prepared using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> and visualized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TreeView</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          ] , using log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -transformed and median-centered
          average difference values.
          To select <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for further analysis from the pilot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fold-change threshold was used in
          combination with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> difference call of either
          increase (I), marginal increase (MI), decrease (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) and
          marginal decrease (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> selected as either
          increased or decreased in a particular RCCa subtype both
          samples had to show concordance in their fold-change and
          difference call, and both samples from the other subtype
          had to have a difference call of no change (NC) or a call
          that was opposite to that of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> subtype.
          To select genes that were significantly changed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> samples) verses normal kidney (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>) a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-parametric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> test was used to calculate a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>-value for each gene. Genes were then selected that
          conformed to all of the following criteria: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value â‰¤
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>; a mean average difference value â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 200</NUMEX>; fold-change
          â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 1.1</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> relative to normal kidney
          or fold-change â‰¤ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.1</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> decreased in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> relative
          to normal kidney.
          All selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were then annotated using online
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medline</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMIM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneCards</ENAMEX>. The
          information was used to build a database that included
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">HUGO</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Organization</ENAMEX>) designated names,
          function and expression information, and any tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>.
          Given the absence of available tools for visualization
          of tumor gene expression patterns on a broad scale, we
          devised a classification system called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Functional</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxonomy</ENAMEX>" that categorizes genes according to various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> attributes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> they encode. One
          such functional attribute is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>'s biological role
          at a cellular level. Using a mammalian modification of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae functional
          categories [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munich Information Center for</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Protein Sequences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mips</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochem</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mpg</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de</ENAMEX>) the genes
          were placed into a hierarchical classification scheme
          containing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> primary categories of cellular function.
          The number of genes that fell within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> primary
          category was counted and plotted graphically to generate
          a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-level "signature" (see Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Aand 4A</ENAMEX>). Each of
          the primary categories was further divided into
          subcategories for a more detailed second-level
          visualization of the data (see Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, 4Band
          4C).
