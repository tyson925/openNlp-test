        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Asthma</ENAMEX> is a common condition in general medical
        practice, accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> of all ambulatory visits
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The mortality rate from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> has risen
        sharply since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>, which may reflect increasing
        disease severity [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The hospitalization rate, another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>-level marker of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> severity, remains
        substantial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], generating nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        health care costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Hospitalization rates
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> have actually increased in some demographic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subgroups</ENAMEX>, such as young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] and the urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], despite recent therapeutic advances. Understanding the
        factors underlying hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> could help
        elucidate the recent rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma morbidity</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies have identified several factors that
        contribute to increased hospitalization risk among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>. Demographic characteristics, such as poverty,
        low educational attainment, female gender, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>, have been associated with a greater
        risk of hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. Poor health care access and inadequate preventive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care have also been frequently cited as contributing
        factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5, 12, 13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]. In these studies, however,
        separating the independent effects of demographic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, health care access, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> severity
        has been difficult. For instance, the association between
        low income or non-white race and greater asthma
        hospitalization risk is potentially confounded by
        inadequate health care access. Because many studies rely on
        ecologic socioeconomic and hospitalization data,
        individual-level factors - especially asthma severity -
        cannot be adequately examined [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>]. Other studies have not yet provided prospective
        follow-up [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 19, 20</TIMEX>] or have not simultaneously
        considered both demographic and clinical variables [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>].
        In this article, using a prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, we delineate the relative impact of
        demographic characteristics and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> severity on
        subsequent hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>. Since study subjects
        were recruited from a random sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> practices,
        they all had access to health care for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>. As a result,
        we could evaluate the effects of gender, race, income, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> severity on hospitalization, independent of health
        care access.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Subject recruitment and retention
          We used data collected during a prospective,
          longitudinal cohort study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> recruited
          from physician practices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern California</ENAMEX>. Details
          of the study design have been previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. Each subject underwent a structured,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">computer-assisted</ENAMEX> telephone interview covering
          demographic characteristics, smoking history, asthma
          history, symptoms, and treatment, health status, health
          care utilization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, and insurance for asthma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> registered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">669</NUMEX> eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. After
          initial data collection at baseline ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">601</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> follow-up
          interviews ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">539</NUMEX>), we later restricted the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">371</NUMEX> of the baseline cohort (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX> of total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">registry</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX> of the follow-up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of
          restricted baseline cohort). We restricted the data set
          to eliminate all interviews potentially compromised by
          faulty data collection or documentation by a single
          survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. This restricted data set
          excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who were found to be
          outside the study age range and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">206</NUMEX> baseline subjects
          with inconsistent data during subsequent re-interview. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">371</NUMEX> baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, the present study excludes an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> follow-up interview
          who had inconsistent data at later interviews or did not
          complete follow-up, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX> follow-up interviews (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          month). These exclusions had no significant effect on
          study findings.
          Demographic data for comparison of the baseline cohort
          ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">371</NUMEX>) with registered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">669</NUMEX>) are not available.
          Compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who participated in both baseline
          and follow-up interviews ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without complete
          follow-up interviews ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX>) were younger (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36.6 years</TIMEX>
          versus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40.5 years</TIMEX>) and less likely to have white
          race/ethnicity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>, respectively). There were
          no statistical differences in history of ever smoking
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in both interviews versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> of
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> at follow-up), female gender (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX> versus
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>), atopic history (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX>), or
          severity-of-asthma scores (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.0</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.6</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.15</NUMEX> in all cases).
        
        
          Hospitalization for asthma
          The primary study outcome was self-reported
          hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18-month</TIMEX>
          prospective follow-up period. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were asked at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> follow-up interviews whether they had been
          hospitalized for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 18 months</TIMEX>.
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> could indicate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> positive
          response, we analyzed the binary outcome of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
          hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Risk factor variables
          All demographic variables were based on baseline
          subject interview responses. Current and prior cigarette
          smoking history was assessed using questions adapted from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Health Interview Survey</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
          We previously developed and validated a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>-item
          disease-specific severity-of-asthma score with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          subscales: frequency of current <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> symptoms (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX>
          or nocturnal), use of systemic corticosteroids, use of
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (besides systemic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corticosteroids</ENAMEX>), and history of hospitalizations and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intubations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25</TIMEX>]. Possible total scores range
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 0 to 28</TIMEX>, with higher scores reflecting more severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>. To examine the relative impact of recent and
          remote hospitalization on further hospitalization for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> over longitudinal follow-up, we removed
          hospitalization from the established severity score and
          defined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new variables: recent hospitalization (during
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> prior to baseline interview), or remote
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX> (past hospitalization not meeting the
          previous definition of recent). As a result, the
          hospitalization and intubation subscale now reflects only
          prior history of intubation.
          Several other clinical aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> were
          assessed. We defined asthma onset as the subject-reported
          age of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> asthma symptoms. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atopic</ENAMEX> history was defined
          by a reported history of allergic rhinitis or atopic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dermatitis</ENAMEX>. Because prior work suggests an unexpectedly
          high prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin intolerance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
          near fatal asthma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], we ascertained any history of
          aspirin sensitivity at baseline interview. Since
          gastroesophageal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">reflux disease</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GERD</ENAMEX>) may exacerbate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> symptoms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], we evaluated whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          taking H2-blockers or proton pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> as
          surrogates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GERD</ENAMEX> and related conditions. We
          furthermore determined whether subjects possessed a peak
          flow <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX> for home usage.
          Generic health status was measured using the Medical
          Outcomes Study <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 questionnaire [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>]. We assessed
          several indicators of health care access for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care,
          including whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a regular site for asthma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, a principal care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, medical
          insurance for outpatient asthma care, and an annual
          deduction for outpatient medical care. We also identified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who appeared to rely on emergency department
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) services for urgent asthma care. We defined reliance
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED care</ENAMEX> as one or more self-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ED</ENAMEX> visits during
          the interview interval but no urgent outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> visits for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, either to regular or alternate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          In a previous analysis of pulmonary and allergy
          specialist care, the severity-of-asthma score was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increased risk of hospitalization at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> follow-up [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. The current study evaluates
          other risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>-related hospitalization,
          taking baseline asthma severity into account. Because
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> severity may act on the causal pathway between a
          risk factor and subsequent hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, we
          present multivariate models both including and excluding
          baseline asthma severity and generic health status. For
          example, low education could increase the risk of
          hospitalization either directly, through poor
          self-management strategies, or indirectly, if poorly
          educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> have greater asthma severity for other
          reasons. We also delineate the components of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>
          severity - respiratory symptoms, systemic corticosteroid
          use, other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use, past intubations, and
          previous hospitalizations - that are most strongly
          predictive of subsequent hospitalization.
          Interview data were analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.12</NUMEX> software
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). We evaluated the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between baseline characteristics and the risk
          of hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> during the ensuing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX>
          follow-up period, reported at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> interview. We
          use the data set restricted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with verified
          baseline and follow-up interviews for all analyses.
          Bivariate relationships were examined using logistic
          regression analysis, with separate models for each
          predictor variable. We used multiple logistic regression
          analysis to elucidate the independent association between
          each baseline variable and the prospective risk of
          hospitalization. In constructing the multivariate model,
          all predictor variables whose bivariate odds ratio and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval suggested a possible association
          with hospitalization were entered into the final model.
          All variables deemed important on an a priori basis, such
          as age, were also included.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Health care access
          Reflecting the sampling method employed, all subjects
          identified a regular source of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care and a primary
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care at baseline interview.
          The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>) also reported having
          health insurance covering outpatient visits for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of subjects indicated having
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> insurance deductible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> visits (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX>).
          The majority of subjects continued to report health
          insurance coverage (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>) and ongoing primary asthma care
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> follow-up. Despite apparent access to
          outpatient medical care, a substantial proportion (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>)
          appeared to rely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> for urgent asthma care.
        
        
          Demographic factors and the risk of
          hospitalization: bivariate analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> that the mean baseline age was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40.5 years</TIMEX>
          and the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were female (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>). A
          substantial proportion reported ever smoking cigarettes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX>), with fewer indicating current smoking (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>). The
          majority of subjects indicated white, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX>
          race/ethnicity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) reported at least one
          hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> during the prospective
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> follow-up period. Of the baseline
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, non-white race (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>) and lower income (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>) were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a greater risk of hospitalization for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18-month</TIMEX> follow-up (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> had an increased likelihood of hospitalization,
          although the confidence interval did not exclude no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>. Greater educational attainment was related
          to a lower risk of hospitalization (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> per year of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.70</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Clinical risk factors for hospitalization:
          bivariate analysis
          A greater severity-of-asthma score, excluding its
          hospitalization component, was associated with a higher
          risk of subsequent hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX>
          per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-point score increment; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.7</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Although remote asthma hospitalization did not appear
          related to risk of ensuing hospitalization, more recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX> was strongly associated with increased
          risk (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.6</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.2</NUMEX>). Other clinical
          variables that may reflect exacerbating factors, such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin allergy</ENAMEX> and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gastric acid</ENAMEX> suppression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, were also associated with a greater risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma hospitalization</ENAMEX>.
          Better baseline generic physical health status (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>)
          was associated with a slightly decreased risk of
          subsequent hospitalization (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> reduction in odds per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          point score increment; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Mental
          health status was furthermore associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
          reduction in the risk of hospitalization per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> point (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> on emergency department care was
          finally related to a greater risk of hospitalization (OR,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Risk of hospitalization - multivariate
          analysis
          We examined the independent impact of selected
          covariates on the prospective risk of hospitalization for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma using multiple logistic</ENAMEX> regression analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Of the demographic characteristics, non-white race
          was associated with a greater risk of subsequent asthma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.8</NUMEX>) after
          controlling for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma severity</ENAMEX> and the other covariates
          shown. Lower household income was also related to a
          greater risk of hospitalization (OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decrement</ENAMEX>), although the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval did not
          exclude no relation to hospitalization (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>).
          Controlling for demographic and other variables, greater
          severity-of-asthma score (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-point increment;
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.8</NUMEX>) and recent hospitalization for asthma
          (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.4</NUMEX>) were strongly associated with
          an increased risk of hospitalization. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance on ED</ENAMEX> for
          urgent asthma care was also related to greater risk.
          We examined the relation between race and
          hospitalization in more detail. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increased risk of hospitalization for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, compared with white, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, after
          controlling for covariates (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58.4</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX>/ethnicity also appeared related to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.0</NUMEX>). There was no
          apparent relation between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> and risk of hospital
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">admission</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.9</NUMEX>).
          To further examine the association between asthma
          severity and hospitalization, we repeated the
          multivariate analysis dividing the overall
          severity-of-asthma score into its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> subscales. The
          systemic corticosteroid score (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-point score
          increment; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>) and recent hospitalization
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43.0</NUMEX>) were significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX>, after controlling for covariates. There
          was, conversely, no statistical relationship between
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>) or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> symptom scores (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>) and the
          ensuing risk of hospitalization. Systemic corticosteroid
          use and recent asthma hospitalization, then, appear to
          drive the relationship between asthma severity and
          hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>.
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> severity could act as a causal
          intermediate between a risk factor and the risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX>, we repeated the multivariate analysis
          excluding asthma severity and generic health status from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). In this analysis, low income was
          more strongly related to a greater risk of
          hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.02</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>).
          Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gastric acid</ENAMEX> suppression therapy was also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased risk (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9</NUMEX>). Although other point estimates and confidence
          intervals changed slightly, there were no other notable
          changes compared with the model controlling for asthma
          severity.
          To examine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without baseline health
          insurance coverage (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>) were affecting study results, we
          repeated the multivariate analysis excluding these
          subjects. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> subjects hospitalized at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follow-up</ENAMEX> had no baseline health insurance. There was no
          meaningful impact on the results in all multivariate
          analyses. For example, the estimate for lower income in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> without asthma severity was nearly unchanged
          (OR, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.03</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Asthma</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality have risen
        sharply in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, a potentially avoidable
        outcome, is an important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-level marker of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>
        severity. In this prospective study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with
        continued access to medical care for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, we identified
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> demographic factors (low income and non-white race)
        that were associated with a greater risk of hospitalization
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> on the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> for urgent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care was also associated with a greater risk of
        subsequent hospitalization. Greater asthma severity, as
        indicated by recent asthma hospitalization and systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corticosteroid</ENAMEX> use, was related to an increased likelihood
        of hospitalization.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecologic</ENAMEX> studies, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> census data, have
        demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between median
        household income and hospitalization rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5, 6, 15, 16</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> who live in lower income
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> regions have higher rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX>, even after accounting for race and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urbanicity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> have also observed a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between community income level and mortality
        from adult asthma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34, 35</TIMEX>]. Since these studies lack
        individual-level income data, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have urged
        cautious interpretation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The present study, using
        individual level data, supports the association between
        lower household income and a greater risk of
        hospitalization. The relationship between lower income and
        hospitalization is less strong in the model including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma severity</ENAMEX> and health status, suggesting that greater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> severity may mediate this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        The relationship between low income and asthma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX> has many potential explanations, including
        inadequate health care access. Low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in a
        population-based survey were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately three</NUMEX> times more
        likely to report difficulty paying for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> bills or
        prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> than those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with higher income [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>]. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> hospitalized for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> at a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one-third</NUMEX> of low income subjects
        indicated no usual source of outpatient asthma care at
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-month</TIMEX> follow-up [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. In the present study, however,
        nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> reported health insurance and access to
        ambulatory care for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, making this an unlikely
        explanation. Moreover, excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> without baseline
        health insurance coverage had no appreciable affect on the
        results.
        Beyond health care access, the process of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care
        may be less adequate among low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> found that, after admission to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received lower
        intensity asthma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> than those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with higher
        income [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Another study demonstrated an association
        between a surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker</ENAMEX> of low income (unemployment) and
        high daily beta agonist use [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], which is an established
        risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> hospitalization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. In a managed
        care setting, which should ensure health care access, low
        income <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were less likely to visit an asthma
        specialist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Low income may alternatively be a marker
        for other exacerbating factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cockroach antigen</ENAMEX>
        exposure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 38</ENAMEX>], cigarette smoking, secondhand smoke
        exposure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>], or viral upper respiratory infections.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> has been associated with higher
        hospitalization rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>] and ecologic studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 16</ENAMEX>].
        Socioeconomic status and health care access, however, may
        confound the relationship between race and hospitalization.
        Several small-area analyses found higher asthma
        hospitalizations rates among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX>, after
        statistically controlling for income [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 15</ENAMEX>]. Other
        analyses have found no effect of race, after taking income
        into account [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with access to health care
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> still observed higher
        hospitalization rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">African-American asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> similarly had a
        greater risk of hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> in managed care
        settings with access to primary care [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 20</TIMEX>]. Even after
        taking insurance status into account, a national survey
        found a higher proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> reporting
        difficulty affording medical care than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>]. Our study suggests that the increased risk of
        hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> is not
        entirely explained by income, education, or health care
        access, which were controlled by design or analysis.
        We also discovered a suggestion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>
        race or ethnicity had a higher risk of hospitalization for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> compared with white, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Previous
        studies focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> have provided
        inconsistent findings. Studies from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> are hospitalized more
        frequently for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 6</ENAMEX>], whereas previous data from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> have not found an increased risk [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Other
        studies have demonstrated a decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
        mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41, 42</TIMEX>].
        The heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> or ethnicity
        may explain these variable results.
        Higher severity-of-asthma scores were associated with a
        greater risk of hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>. On examining
        disease-specific severity in more detail, we found that
        recent asthma hospitalizations and systemic corticosteroid
        use accounted for most of this increased risk, whereas
        recent respiratory symptoms and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use
        were not predictive. In a recent analysis of adult health
        maintenance organization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> use and previous hospitalization were also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with greater risk of hospitalization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. A
        study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hospitalized asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> similarly found that
        both factors were related to rehospitalization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>].
        Neither study, however, controlled for sociodemographic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, such as low income, that are associated
        with hospitalization risk. In the present study,
        disease-specific severity was associated with a greater
        risk of hospitalization, controlling for other demographic,
        clinical, and health care access factors.
        Our findings differ from previous studies that found
        female gender and current smoking as risk factors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> hospitalization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 39</ENAMEX>]. Female gender has not
        consistently been related to hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>]. The lack of association with smoking could be
        explained by the 'healthy smoker effect' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. According
        to this principle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who develop smoking-related
        respiratory symptoms quit smoking, resulting in current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> who are less susceptible to acute effects of
        smoking.
        Previous studies evaluating the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GERD</ENAMEX> on asthma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> have provided mixed results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>]. In the
        present study, use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gastric acid</ENAMEX> suppression therapy, a
        potential surrogate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GERD</ENAMEX>, was associated with a greater
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> hospitalization only in multivariate
        analysis that did not control for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma severity</ENAMEX>. This
        suggests that increased asthma severity may function as a
        causal intermediate between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GERD</ENAMEX> (or related conditions)
        and the increased likelihood of hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>.
        Consistent with this finding, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> found that treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GERD</ENAMEX>
        with omeprazole improved <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>-specific quality of life [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>].
        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> treated by specialists
        usually have more severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> than those treated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalist physicians</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], our study results should be
        generalized to the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of asthmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
        with caution. Although our sampling method attenuates
        confounding by access to medical care for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, the
        results may not fully apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> without health
        care access. Also reflecting the sampling from specialty
        practices, study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had a higher median household
        income and educational attainment than the general
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Even so, low income was a risk factor for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> hospitalization, suggesting that our findings may be
        more broadly applicable.
        The present study has additional limitations, including
        the reliance on self-reported health care utilization.
        Socioeconomic differences in recall or reporting of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX>, for instance, could influence the risk
        model. Although we were able to simultaneously consider
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demographic</ENAMEX>, clinical, and severity-related covariates, the
        current study does not fully elucidate the causal
        intermediates between predictors (eg income or race) and
        the risk of hospitalization. Finally, our use of
        self-reported health insurance status and source of regular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care may not fully ascertain other, more subtle,
        barriers to effective asthma care. Previous work has
        demonstrated that health insurance status does not fully
        explain health care-related financial problems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
        Transportation difficulties, work-related demands, and
        regional differences in health care quality may also have
        impeded access to efficacious <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> care. Despite these
        limitations, we believe the present study results may be
        generalized to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with moderate to severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> are
        increasing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> and around the world, the minority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> will experience hospitalization or death
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>. Targeted interventions could potentially
        benefit high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in a cost-effective manner.
        Our results suggest that simple demographic and clinical
        features, especially low income, non-white race, previous
        hospitalization history, systemic corticosteroid use, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliance</ENAMEX> on emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> for urgent asthma care,
        can identify such high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for more intensive
        therapy.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary</ENAMEX> material
        
          Subject recruitment and retention
          In brief, we recruited a random sample of certified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Board of Medical Specialty</ENAMEX> pulmonary specialists
          and allergy/immunology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. The participating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> maintained a registry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-50</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> with outpatient visits for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> over a
          prospective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-week</TIMEX> period. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> registered by a
          participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> was contacted to arrange a
          telephone interview.
        
        
          Risk factor variables
          We ascertained household income as a series of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">increments</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $5000</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5001-$10,000</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX>
          increments <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $50,000</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,001-$75,000</NUMEX>, and above
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75,000</NUMEX>). To convert to specific income levels, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-increment value was applied (except for the highest
          category, where we used a value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$87,500</NUMEX>).
          The severity-of-asthma score systemic corticosteroid
          sub-scale includes items for any past corticosteroid use,
          use during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 12 months</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid dependency</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> subscale incorporates current use
          of inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled non-steroidal
          anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, inhaled bronchodilators, oral
          beta agonists and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">theophylline-containing medications</ENAMEX>,
          nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> (antihistamines, decongestants, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">topical corticosteroids</ENAMEX>), and home nebulizer use. In this
          subscale, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point is assigned for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> used
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 2 weeks</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> additional point for
          frequent inhaled beta agonist or corticosteroid use.
          We measured generic health status using the Medical
          Outcomes Study <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-36 questionnaire. Previous work
          demonstrates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> instrument's validity in adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. The physical and mental component summary
          scores have been defined from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SF</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> subscales
          by factor analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], which measure physical and
          mental dimensions of health, respectively. Each summary
          score in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> and a
          standard deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. Higher scores reflect more
          favorable health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
