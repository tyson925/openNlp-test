        Endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecules (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'ECAMs'</ENAMEX>) play
        essential roles in the development of chronic inflammation
        by recruiting leukocytes, especially lymphocytes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAMs</ENAMEX> support several forms of leukocyte adhesion
        including rolling, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> adhesion and extravasation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Infiltration of tissues by leukocytes is a common hallmark
        of many chronic inflammatory states that include the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory bowel diseases</ENAMEX> (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC),
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> (CD). In the setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, the
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAMs</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, and MAdCAM-1
        (mucosal addressin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecule-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is observed in
        experimental models of colitis, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] and also within
        the inflamed human colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">in Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> and ulcerative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colitis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Among the adhesion molecules up-regulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>, the mucosal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecule, is thought to
        be preeminent in the development of chronic gut
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is normally expressed in the gut,
        and its expression is dramatically amplified during
        inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . The functional significance of
        increased appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> is supported by
        several reports which show that immunoneutralization of
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> or its ligand, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±4Î²7</NUMEX> integrin, attenuate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> and mucosal damage in animal models of colitis
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . However, since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> directed
        against other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAMs</ENAMEX>, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, can as well
        reduce disease activity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">colitis</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] ,
        the literature suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is probably
        necessary, but insufficient for the maximal penetrance of
        experimental and probably also clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>.
        Based on these findings, it is apparent that a better
        understanding of the mechanisms regulating ECAM expression,
        especially that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>, might help to devise improved
        therapies for colitis.
        It has been suggested that pathologic activation of the
        mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key
        factor in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, changes in
        leukocyte migration and cytokine production appear to
        contribute the perpetuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Based on modern
        advances, recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>) treatment is now being developed for experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colitis</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IBD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> produced by macrophages and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytes</ENAMEX> appears to limit chronic inflammation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX>
        ] , through a decreased release of inflammatory factors
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-1, IL-6, IL-12</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM-CSF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCSF</ENAMEX>), suppression of
        adhesive determinants (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II molecule, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²7</NUMEX>), and by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">blocking ICAM-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] .
        Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> gene-knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> develop a chronic
        colitis that is extremely similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        treatment can reduce inflammation in several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colitis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29 30</NUMEX> ] and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IBD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ]
        . However, the clinical efficacy of systemically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">administered IL-10</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> mild to moderately active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> has not been as effective as hoped [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> colitis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is contentious [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        We have described in vitro that exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, and
        attenuates lymphocyte adhesion to lymphatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">node</ENAMEX> derived
        endothelium under cytokine stimulating conditions via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-kB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The purpose of the current study was to
        show that induction of endothelial expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        through an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> expression vector attenuates MAdCAM-1
        expression in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± and optimistically suggests
        the possibility of targeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX>-cytokine gene therapy in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>.

          Secretion of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> concentration by

          To screen for the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVEC</ENAMEX>,
          we initially measured the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> concentration in the

          medium (control), nor any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> not shown ). However, the
          medium from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> transfected SVEC medium showed a
          large and significant increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> concentration
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1209 Â± 2 pg/ml</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> gene transfection

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Alone, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> gene transfection
          had no effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml, 24 h</ENAMEX>) significantly increased the adhesion of TK-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVEC</ENAMEX> monolayers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> gene transfection
          significantly reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TK-1</ENAMEX> adhesion in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
          stimulation at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> did not modify the basal level of lymphocyte

        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> kDa endothelial cell surface molecule
        that is strongly expressed by mucosal endothelial cells,
        particularly following exposure of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to
        pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF-Î±.</ENAMEX> Expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> has also been reported in the brain, and in the
        heart [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] ; based on these findings, it is now been
        suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> might play roles in chronic
        inflammation of these organs as well.
        With respect to inflammatory bowel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, MAdCAM-1
        appears to be essential to the lymphocyte homing to the
        mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 37 38 46</ENAMEX> ] .
        Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> is normally expressed mainly within the gut
        microvasculature, and is dramatically amplified during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>,
        it has been suggested that increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression
        contributes to the etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> through its ability to
        direct homing of lymphocytes to the gut. This notion is
        well supported by several reports that show that antibodies
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> against either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>, or its lymphocyte ligand,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±4Î²7</NUMEX> integrin will significantly attenuate several
        indices of gut damage in experimental models of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">colitis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> ] .
        Several studies have indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T helper</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th1</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response has important roles in the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, dysregulation of cytokine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> is involved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX>-dominant immune responses in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th1</NUMEX> cytokines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± is
        thought to be perhaps the most important cytokine
        responsible for driving the onset and evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>.
        Because of this prime role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, anti-TNF-Î±
        antibody therapy has been very successfully used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> to
        reduce both colonic injury and expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAMs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX>, a cytokine produced by activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophages</ENAMEX> and
        Th2-type T cells, has crucial inhibitory effect against
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Th</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> type immune responses, such as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-presenting functions of monocytes and macrophages [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> may play an important role in preventing
        the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> deficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> will
        develop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colitis</ENAMEX> spontaneously, and low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> are
        positively correlated with recurrences of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 54</NUMEX> ] . However, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± based therapies, the
        administration of recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> (rIL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) shows poor
        clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>. This may reflect the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
        therapies for IBD are aimed at efficiently clearing TNF-Î±,
        while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-10 therapies must 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">increase IL-10</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        is likely too rapidly cleared from the circulation after 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to provide a
        uniform protection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 
        gene transfer technology has been
        used with some success in models of colitis, however its
        effectiveness is also variable. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for this
        variability may be that the final serum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> concentration
        of gene-transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> might be below the critical
        threshold needed for gut protection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX> ] . Therefore
        targeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> to the inflamed colon should
        ideally exploit tissue (i.e. gut) specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> selective organ gene transfer technology,
        endothelial specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> and also organ specific
        intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arterial</ENAMEX> injection of vector to activate some genes
        in specific locations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] .
        Administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 
        in vitro prevents TNF-Î± stimulated
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>, and also blocks lymphocyte adhesion
        to endothelial cells to the same extent as dexamethasone
        treatment, currently a key therapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, the low basal levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expressed
        by control (cytokine unstimulated) cells were not affected
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> transfection. This suggests that basal expression
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> independent, while cytokine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">stimulated MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> 
        is modulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. While we
        previously showed that delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> to the endothelium
        
        in vitro is protective against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , 
        in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> has not been as
        effective. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathways</ENAMEX> in
        ECAM expression, one is a cytokine-dependent pathway which
        is widely studied and the other is cytokine-independent [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> apparently prevents cytokine-induced NF-kB
        binding activity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] and blocks the
        excessive expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAMs</ENAMEX> in cytokine-mediated
        inflammatory conditions. In this regard, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> has been
        used as a treatment in inflammatory diseases, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> for
        precisely this reason: because it has few effects at sites
        remote from inflammation. Similarly, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> did not affect cell morphology, total protein
        level, or the expression of actin and vimentin in these
        cells (measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponceau</ENAMEX> red S staining density on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblots</ENAMEX>). Therefore methods like endothelial gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">transfection/transfer</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo may effectively maintain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">adequate IL-10</ENAMEX> concentrations near the endothelial cells
        that finally achieve the protection against cytokines that
        is not uniformly produced by systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        administration.
        The most important index for how well gene mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recombinant IL-10</ENAMEX> delivery might work in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> appears to be
        measurement of the inhibition of lymphocyte-endothelium
        binding mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression. In
        this experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">induction</ENAMEX> in the endothelium
        efficiently blocked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF-Î± induced MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> expression and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±4Î²7</NUMEX>-dependent lymphocyte adhesion on SVEC endothelial
        cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> deficiency in colitis increases expression of
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ECAMs</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ]
        . We performed an experiment, where under non-stimulated
        conditions <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 55.7 Â± 5.4%</NUMEX> as many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TK-1</ENAMEX> lymphocytes
        bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVEC</ENAMEX> compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± stimulation (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'maximal</ENAMEX>' binding). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TK-1</ENAMEX> were seen to interact with SVEC
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICAM-1</ENAMEX> as well <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX>, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, since an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> reduced adhesion to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6%</NUMEX> of
        maximum and an anti-ICAM-1 reduced adhesion to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54.6</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3 %</NUMEX>
        of maximum; anti-VCAM-1 reduced adhesion to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX> of maximum
        (blocks lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> not shown ). Therefore we feel
        that adhesion in this system is mostly MAdCAM-1
        dependent.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> transfection of endothelial cells reduced MAdCAM-1
        expression by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> (following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î± stimulation) and reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TK-1</ENAMEX> adhesion by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. Therefore, these data suggest that
        the reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TK-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">adhesion</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 84%</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%/50%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAdCAM-1</ENAMEX> dependent, and that the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of
        adhesion depends on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECAMs</ENAMEX>, (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM-1</ENAMEX>).
        Although tissue specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> might further
        increase the organ specificity and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> delivery of
        this approach, they have not been evaluated in this report.
        Our findings suggest that lymphatic or gut endothelial
        transfection with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th2</ENAMEX> cytokines like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-10</ENAMEX> may be an
        effective method to reduce important clinical symptoms
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> which are mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAdCAM</ENAMEX>-1
        dependent lymphocyte adhesion.
