        Although a number of recently introduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotherapeutic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have demonstrated significant
        anti-tumor activity in advanced colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains 5-fluorouracil (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5-FU</NUMEX>) - based chemotherapy.
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] A vast series of pre-clinical and clinical studies
        have suggested 5-FU is a more active anti-tumor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> when
        modulated by a host of compounds including leucovorin, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>

        ] and recombinant interferon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alfa-2a</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFNaα-2a</ENAMEX>). [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ]
        Protracted venous infusion (PVI) 5-FU <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regimens</ENAMEX> have also
        resulted in increased response rates in some studies, but
        only results in a modest benefit in median survival. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] Oral fluoropyrimidines and oral regimens using
        prodrugs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-FU</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of dihydropyrimidine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> (DPD) which pharmacologically simulate the
        intravenous continuous infusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5-FU</ENAMEX> are
        currently under clinical evaluation. Although these studies
        are important and may demonstrate equivalency, it is not
        clear these oral compounds will result in a significant
        improvement compared to the intravenous infusion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX>. [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ]
        Potentiation of the anti-tumor activity of 5-FU by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methotrexate</ENAMEX> (MTX) and leucovorin (LV) requires careful
        scheduling to achieve the most favorable interactions
        between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. In vitro and in vivo studies have
        both suggested a synergistic as well as antagonistic effect
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-FU</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> are used in combination. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] In this report, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> modulators of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX> were used in
        a sequential manner, anticipating an enhancement of the
        efficacy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX> before the development of 5-FU resistance
        and subsequent disease progression. The order of
        administration of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> was chosen to optimally
        exploit the reported differing mechanisms of biochemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulation</ENAMEX>. The objectives of this phase <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> study were to
        determine the activity and toxicity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MTX/LV/5-FU</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advanced colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.

          Treatment Plan
          Consistent with the traditional design of phase II
          studies, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received therapy as outlined in the
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">schema</ENAMEX> in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Methotrexate was

          intravenous infusion of leucovorin was administered at a
          dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 mg/m 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midway</ENAMEX> through the leucovorin

          minute intravenous bolus infusion. This represented a
          course of therapy and was repeated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX>. Dose
          modifications for hematologic toxicity were made on the
          basis of counts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of treatment. For a white

          count = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">platelets</ENAMEX>/ul, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> dose reduction of all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> was performed. For white blood counts less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> cells/ul and a platelet count < 100,000
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">platelets/ul</ENAMEX> - all therapy was held until the counts had
          fully recovered (white blood count = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</NUMEX> cells/ul and a
          platelet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">count</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> experiencing a white

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> complete blood counts, including platelet
          counts and white blood count differentials were conducted
          to determine the level of myelosuppresion. Before every

          complete chemistry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> including electrolytes and serum
          creatinine were obtained. All <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> were measured
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bidimensionally</ENAMEX> and assessed for changes by either an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imaging</ENAMEX> study (computed tomography, chest x-ray,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultrasound</ENAMEX>) or by clinical examination to determine
          response to therapy. Treatment was continued until
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease progression</ENAMEX> became evident or side effects became
          intolerable.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Methods</ENAMEX>
          This study was planned to recruit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> evaluable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, allowing us to estimate objective tumor
          response to within +/- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence.
          Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were subsequently accrued to increase
          the precision of our estimates of response and survival.
          The trial was conducted with one interim analysis after
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluable patients</ENAMEX>. If no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had experienced an
          objective tumor response, the study would have been
          terminated. The two-stage design used in this study was
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Gehan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gehan E.A. The</ENAMEX>

          The probability of observing no responses was less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> if the true response was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> or greater.
          Progression-free survival was defined as the time from
          study entry to the first observation of disease
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> or death as a result of any <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Survival
          was defined as the time of study entry until death as a
          result of any cause. These time-to-event parameters were
          summarized using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> product-limit estimates.
          Log rank tests were used to assess which factors were
          univariately predictive of the time to progression and
          survival, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards regression
          model was used to assess which factors were jointly
          predictive of these outcomes. The statistical analysis
          was performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> package, version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.12</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled onto the study were assessable for
          toxicity. Mucositis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX>/vomiting and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> were
          the most commonly observed toxicities and are listed in

          attained partial responses; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> have died of progressive

          The overall estimated median time to progression was
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5.6 months</TIMEX>. The estimated progression free survival at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.5%</NUMEX> (standard error <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5%</NUMEX>). The overall
          estimated median survival time was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13.0 months</TIMEX>. The
          estimated survival rate at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.7%</NUMEX> (standard

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The prognostic factors found to be
          significant on univariate analysis were ECOG performance
          score, gender and number of metastatic sites. Female
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with fewer metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an ECOG performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> had a statistically
          significant improved survival. Survival by metastatic
          site is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastasis</ENAMEX> and those without intra-abdominal metastasis
          had longer survival times. In the multivariate analysis,
          presence of lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, lower LDH levels female sex,
          better performance status and fewer metastatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were
          statistically predictive of longer survival (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> not

        Discussion
        The rationale, at least in part, for this phase <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> study
        comes from pre-clinical data suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and LV
        potentiate the anti-tumor activity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX>. The cytotoxic
        effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5-FU</ENAMEX> are mediated through inhibition of DNA
        and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA synthesis</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis inhibition</ENAMEX> is
        mediated by the binding of the active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX> metabolite
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-fluoro-2'deoxyuridine - 5-monophosphate</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>dUMP) to the
        enzyme thymidylate synthetase (TS). This binding is
        enhanced by high concentrations of reduced folate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cofactors</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] Although this ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is
        covalent, it dissociates with a half-life of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-3 hours</TIMEX> in
        the absence of excess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-methylene tetrahydrofolate.
        Thus high levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-methylene tetrahydrofolate
        derived from LV not only allows optimum ternary complex
        formation, but also prevents subsequent breakdown of the
        complex. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] Additional in vitro studies suggest cells
        may need prolonged exposure to reduced folates in order to
        obtain maximum inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FdUMP</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] A second
        observed means of potentiating the cytotoxic effects of
        5-FU is through the pre-treatment of cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX>.
        MTX-induced enhancement of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRPP</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> with subsequent increased synthesis of 5-FU
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and incorporation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fluoriuridine</NUMEX> -
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-triphosphate (FUTP) into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> has been proposed as the
        basis for this biochemical modulation. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 39</NUMEX> ]
        Subsequent in vivo studies using fluorine 19 magnetic
        resonance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectroscopy</ENAMEX> confirmed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fold increase in
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-fluoronucleotide</TIMEX> (FNuct), the active 5-FU <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolite</ENAMEX>,
        following the pre-treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        These observed changes in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5-FU</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">catabolism</ENAMEX> resulted in a
        greater anti-tumor activity than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MTX</ENAMEX> given alone or MTX
        given after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX>. Consistent with these pre-clinical
        studies, the design of this phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> trial involved a
        fluorouracil infusion that was initiated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> into the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hour</TIMEX> high dose infusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> after the
        initial methotrexate dosing.
        Our phase <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> study provides long-term efficacy and
        safety data for sequential <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MTX-LV-5-FU</ENAMEX> chemotherapy
        administered on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-day</TIMEX> cycle. The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> response rate and
        median survival duration (median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13.0 months</TIMEX>) observed in
        this trial are slightly improved when compared to the
        results reported for intravenous 5-FU therapy. Overall,
        treatment with sequential <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MTX-LV-5-FU</ENAMEX> was very
        well-tolerated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grade III</ENAMEX> diarrhea was seen in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 8%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, grade III and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> mucositis in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8% and 1%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> respectively and grade III and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IV nausea</ENAMEX>/vomiting
        in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11% and 1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> respectively. The most common
        hematologic toxicity observed was grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and III anemia
        in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18% and 4%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> respectively.
        Other similar studies have shown comparable results in
        terms of the efficacy and safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MTX-LV-5-FU</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advanced colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46 47 48</NUMEX> ]
        . In a meta analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> randomized trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-FU/MTX</ENAMEX>
        versus 5-FU alone, the complete and partial response rates
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5-FU</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> cohort was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MTX/5</NUMEX>-FU. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] In addition, the median
        survival was improved for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MTX/5</NUMEX>-FU, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.7</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> versus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9.1 months</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-FU</TIMEX> alone
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.024</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marsh et al.</ENAMEX> in a
        randomized trial, reported a statistical improvement in
        response, time to progression (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9.9 months</TIMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.9</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>) and median survival (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15.3 months</TIMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>) when the interval between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-FU</ENAMEX> infusion
        was increased from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour to 24 hours</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We suggest our results and the pre-clinical and clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> discussed indicate the sequence of administration of
        5-FU with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LV</ENAMEX> is important. Future studies combining
        5-FU with other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytotoxic</ENAMEX> / biologic compounds should
        consider the mechanism of the interaction and incorporate
        that information into the design of the trial.
