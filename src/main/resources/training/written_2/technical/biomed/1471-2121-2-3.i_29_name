        Although the role of the osteoclast in bone resorption
        is becoming better understood [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], much remains to be
        learned about osteoclastogenesis and the exact mechanism of
        action of anti-resorbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on the functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoclast</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-resorbing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17β</NUMEX>-estradiol is
        especially noteworthy because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of its
        decline at menopause with the development of postmenopausal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX>. As previously noted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX>, the
        underlying cellular changes responsible the increased bone
        formation which follows estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> are still
        not well characterized [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        In the present report we report findings on alterations
        in osteoclast morphology following long term administration
        of high doses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17β</NUMEX>-estradiol to B6D2F1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Development
        of osteosclerosis and the disappearance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> space
        in these estrogen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is an interesting and useful
        model since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> stromal cells not only contain the
        precursors for osteogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lineages</ENAMEX>, but they also
        exert important effects on osteoclastogenesis and
        lymphopoiesis, and modulate the effects of some systemic
        factors of bone turnover. Osteoclasts, as well as
        osteoblasts, possess estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        Hematopoietic cells also influence osteogenic cell
        differentiation, and some evidence suggests that mature
        lymphocytes influence osteoclast and osteoblast function.
        In the estrogen-treated mouse model used in the studies
        reported here, natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> (NK) cells, which rely upon
        an intact bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> for full <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow maturation</ENAMEX>, are
        arrested in a nonlytic state [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]; since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> space is
        lessened due to the osteosclerosis, the spleen provides the
        source for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and B cells and macrophages.
        The objective of the present study was to assess the
        functional state of osteoclasts in estrogen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by
        determining if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> retained tartrate-resistant acid
        phosphatase activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAP</ENAMEX>) and normal ultrastructural
        features.
      
      
        Results
        Radiographic examination of excised specimens from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> confirmed the presence
        of osteosclerosis in the femurs of estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Diaphyseal cortices were prominent in the midshaft of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> specimens (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Aand 1C</ENAMEX>), but could not be
        identified in specimens from estradiol-treated animals
        (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Dand 1E</ENAMEX>). These changes were not due to
        differences in radiographic technique since control and
        estradiol-treated femurs shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1were</NUMEX> exposed
        side-by-side on the same film.
        Histologic examination also confirmed osteosclerotic
        features in femurs from estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Specimens
        from estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> contained only small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B) in contrast to control bones (Figure
        2A). Since the normal, pre-estradiol treatment endosteal
        margin could still be histologically identified on these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX>, specimens were evaluated with quantitative
        histomorphometry by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> measuring the old, normal marrow
        area and then measuring the small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> cavity areas
        present at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">harvest</ENAMEX>. On average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX> of mid-shaft
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">marrow</ENAMEX> space was replaced by bone in estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX> control vs
        estradiol-treated).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteoclasts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX>) present in both control and
        estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> showed positive localization of TRAP
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). In contrast to the close apposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> to
        the bone surface seen in control specimens, in
        estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> Ocl extended away from the bone
        surface with little bone contact (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>). In order to
        further investigate this observation, transmission electron
        microscopy was performed to examine the fine structure of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> in estradiol-treated and control specimens.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3Aillustrates</NUMEX> the normal ultrastructural
        appearance of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> from a control femur; note the normal
        ruffled border and snug apposition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> to the bone
        surface. Ocl from estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, however,
        frequently showed only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> margin of the cell perimeter
        involved with small areas of ruffed border formation, with
        the remainder of the cell surface displaying a smooth
        profile (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ocl</ENAMEX> from estradiol-treated animals
        had no ruffled borders in spite of the appearance of some
        attempt to form sealing podosome regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C).
      
      
        Discussion
        The present study indicated that severe changes in Ocl
        morphology are associated with the cells' inability to
        carry out resorption in the osteosclerotic
        estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> retained TRAP
        activity, ultrastructural alterations were identified in
        estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in both the sealing patterns of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> against the bone surface and in altered brush
        border morphology. Proper sealing of the osteoclast against
        the bone surface and a functional brush border are two
        ultrastructural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> believed to be of major
        importance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ocl</ENAMEX> function. The ultrastructural alterations
        identified in estrogen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were very likely the
        cellular functional basis for the decreased resorption and
        development of osteosclerosis in estrogen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Osteoclast function and ultrastructural morphology have
        been shown to be highly responsive to anti-resorbing agents
        such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate (EHDP) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>],
        dichloromethylene diphosphanate (Cl 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> MDP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], calcitonin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13</TIMEX>],
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-resorptive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mithramycin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>],
        and to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gallium nitrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Although histochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">TRAP localization</ENAMEX> provides an
        accurate and sensitive histologic method for identification
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX>, understanding osteoclastogenesis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> function
        remain a challenging area of bone research. The current
        understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> function is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> seals its
        perimeter along the bone surface by means of the podosome [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 18</TIMEX>] . Within this sealed margin, projections from
        the cytoplasm form the ruffled border, a specialized
        Ocl-extracellular space in which bone resorption occurs. In
        the present study in the mouse, differentiation of
        osteoclast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> appears to be dependent on the
        direct interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> stromal cells with Ocl
        precursor cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. Recent data of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baylink</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linkhart</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] provide evidence that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> inbred strains of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone densities</ENAMEX> may have fundamental
        differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone resorption</ENAMEX> (not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> formation), and
        that genes affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow Ocl</ENAMEX> precursor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> may contribute to relative differences in the
        C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX> strains. In vivo and in vitro studies
        of avian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pederson et al</ENAMEX> to suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modulation of the Ocl</ENAMEX> response to estrogen may be
        controlled by alterations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ocl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor
        level [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Maturation of osteoclasts from their macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX> requires <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow stromal cells</ENAMEX> or their
        osteoblast progeny as shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Udagawa et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. These
        cells produce macrophage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>-stimulating factor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-CSF</ENAMEX>)
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for activation of nuclear factor kappa b
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k B</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANK</ENAMEX>) ligand (RANKL). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-CSF</ENAMEX> is
        essential for macrophage maturation, but formation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> also requires contact between osteoclast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX> and stromal cells or osteoblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. As
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hofbauer et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], the quantity of bone
        resorbed depends on the balance between expression of RANKL
        and of its inhibitor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hofbauer et al</ENAMEX>
        suggest that the stimulation of the pool of M-CSF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX> to committed osteoclastogenesis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANKL</ENAMEX> may be
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the central pathophysiologic pathways involved in
        increasing the number of osteoclasts in osteoporosis.
        Futures studies of the estrogen-treated mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are
        needed which are designed to address osteoclastogenesis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoprotegerin</ENAMEX> (OPG) secretion by osteoblasts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPG</ENAMEX> is
        currently hypothesized to be an important paracrine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of the antiresorptive action of estrogen on bone
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. In osteoblast cell lines exposed to estrogen,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPG</ENAMEX> mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels were increased compared to
        controls. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hofbauer et al</ENAMEX> have suggested that estrogen may
        exert its anti-resorptive effects by enhancement of OPG
        secretion by osteoblasts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        Future studies should also assess the temporal
        development of functional changes in the osteoclast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> during estrogen treatment, and the patterns of
        osteoclast death with special attention to apoptosis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estradiol</ENAMEX> has been shown to modulate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX> action on human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoclasts</ENAMEX> in vitro; estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> inhibited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1-</ENAMEX>mediated cytokine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-8</ENAMEX>) mRNA induction and caused
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ocl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. When avian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ocl</ENAMEX> were exposed
        to estradiol in vitro, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> plasma membrane became
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">depolarized</ENAMEX> and there was a marked decrease in potential,
        suggesting that estrogen may regulate osteoclasts through
        ion channel activities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estradiol</ENAMEX> has also been shown
        to inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> production in avian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pre-Ocl</ENAMEX> cell line <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FLG 29.1</NUMEX> has specific binding sites to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17β</NUMEX>-estradiol on the cell surface, and estradiol exposure
        increases the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>, cGMP and intracellular
        calcium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        In vivo work by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jilka et al</ENAMEX> has shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Il-6</ENAMEX> can
        prevent the bone loss associated with ovariectomy in the
        mouse model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girasole et al</ENAMEX> have recently shown that
        production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> is inhibited in vitro by exposure of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow cells</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17β</NUMEX>-estradiol; cultures of mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone cells</ENAMEX>
        showed suppressed osteoclast development when exposed to
        either <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17β-estradiol</TIMEX> or a neutralizing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Il-6</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. Future in vivo studies combining estradiol and
        selected interleukins may further elucidate how the network
        of signals from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow microenvironment</ENAMEX> influences both
        Ocl development and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocl</ENAMEX> function.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Findings extend our understanding of osteoclast
        structure and function in the mouse exposed in vivo to high
        doses of estrogen. Ultrastructural examination showed that
        osteoclasts from estrogen-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were unable to seal
        against the bone surface and were unable to form ruffled
        borders.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        B6D2F1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were selected for this study based upon the
        following criteria. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> is positive for the
        NK <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> epitope but from previous unpublished data we found
        that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> responded poorly to estradiol. From
        previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid resistance</ENAMEX> studies we had historical data
        that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the B6D2F1</TIMEX> mouse would be positive for the NK <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> and respond well to the estradiol. B6D2F1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">male mice</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">aged 4-5</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> were implanted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 12 weeks</TIMEX> with
        silastic tubing filled with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 mg 17β-estradiol</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>]; age-matched controls received empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tubing</ENAMEX>. NK
        cytolytic functions disappeared in estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 weeks</TIMEX>. Previous work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roubinian et al</ENAMEX>
        showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> mg estradiol by this
        method returned estrogen levels to normal in ovariectomized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 3 months</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seaman et al</ENAMEX> has also
        reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> mg estradiol in this model
        was capable of raising estradiol to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> times the normal
        level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>].
        At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-18 weeks</TIMEX> post-implantation, euthanasia was
        performed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 inhalation</TIMEX>) and femurs were harvested
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> control and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> estradiol-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Cross-sections of the femur and sections of femoral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metaphyses</ENAMEX> and epiphyses were studied. For light
        microscopy, specimens were either fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> neutral
        buffered formalin, decalcified and embedded in paraffin or
        processed non-decalcified and embedded in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methacrylate</ENAMEX>. For ultrastructural studies, specimens were
        fixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karnovsky</ENAMEX>'s fixative, post-fixed in osmium
        tetroxide, decalcified, and embedded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spurr</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX>. Thin
        sections were prepared and grids were stained with uranyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> and lead citrate. Sections were viewed on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM10</ENAMEX> transmission electron microscope. Light
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">microscopic</ENAMEX> sections were evaluated with quantitative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histomorphometry</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OsteoMeasure</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OsteoMetrics</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Decatur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GA</ENAMEX>). Tartrate-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> phosphatase
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRAP</ENAMEX>) localization was performed to identify osteoclasts
        with light microscopy. Protocols were approved by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appropriate Institutional Animal Care</ENAMEX> and Use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>.
        Statistical analysis of quantitative histomorphometric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> used standard statistical methods; means and standard
        deviations were calculated. Unpaired t-tests were used to
        test for differences between means; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-value of <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>
        was considered statistically significant.
