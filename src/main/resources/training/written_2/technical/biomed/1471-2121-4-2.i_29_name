        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte actin cytoskeleton is clearly important
        in the regulation of cell activity at a variety of
        different levels. An intact actin cytoskeleton is required
        for sustained signals leading to T cell activation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T helper</ENAMEX> and cytolytic effector cells reorient their
        intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> for vectorial secretion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] or cytolytic components [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] via
        cytoskeletal dependent mechanisms. Recent reports suggest
        an active role played by the T cell cytoskeleton in
        maintaining spatially defined molecular clusters found
        within the immunological synapse - a highly structured
        molecular array defined by contact regions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen presenting cells</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] , and reviewed in
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] or NK cells and target cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Although the
        actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in all these
        processes, perhaps its greatest role is in regulating T
        lymphocyte motility and morphology.
        The first physical step in directional motility is the
        extension of cellular processes termed pseudopods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Pseudopodia are flattened, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> shape cellular protrusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in signaling molecules and cytoskeletal elements
        including filamentous actin, which is preferentially
        nucleated at the leading edge of a migrating cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        A key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> is the GTP-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Rho</ENAMEX>. This small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras GTPase</ENAMEX> superfamily has been implicated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblast</ENAMEX> models of integrin dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actin</ENAMEX> stress fiber
        formation, focal contact assembly [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , and gene
        induction via the serum response element [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Studies
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> function have been facilitated by the use of
        specific toxins such as 
        Clostridium botulinum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin C3</ENAMEX> which
        catalyses the ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] . The function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> and related family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX> has been extensively studied
        in the fibroblast model. In this system it has been shown
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> function is necessary for the production of actin
        stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . However, in cells that are
        considered highly motile and circulate through various
        compartments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes), actin
        stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> have yet to be identified. By comparison to
        adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> such as fibroblasts, less work has been done
        within the formed elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, in particular,
        studies addressing the role played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maintenance of T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte cytoarchitecture.
        The involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho GTPases</ENAMEX> in regulating integrin
        dependent events such as leukocyte homotypic aggregation
        and in chemokine upregulation of integrin-mediated adhesion
        has recently been identified [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . ADP-ribosylation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in neutrophils by treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> not only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibits</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">locomotion</ENAMEX>, but augments chemoattractant
        induced actin polymerization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Moreover,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivation of Rho</ENAMEX> in monocytic cells leads to accelerated
        formation of filopodia, and it has been proposed that Rho
        is a negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of actin polymerization within this
        cell type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> is also required for normal
        morphology, motility, and cytolytic activity of IL-2
        activated NK cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . We and others have
        demonstrated the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . Given the role played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in the
        regulation of actin microfilaments in other cell types, and
        the indispensability of a functional actin cytoskeleton in
        lymphocyte motility and activation, it is of importance to
        study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX>'s role in the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte integrin
        function and maintenance of cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Electroporation of C3 induces complete
          ADP-ribosylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPB-ALL</ENAMEX>
          Western blotting analysis confirmed the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~25 kDa</NUMEX>) in the human T cell lines HPB-ALL and CEM
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). The bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin C3</ENAMEX> from 
          Clostridium botulinum ribosylates
          asparagine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rho</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] ,
          resulting in its inactivation. C3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">25 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>) was
          electroporated into the T cell line HPB-ALL as described
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methods</ENAMEX>. After thorough washing, the
          cells were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> to allow 
          in vivo ribosylation, then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sonicated</ENAMEX> and lysates subjected to further C3
          ribosylation by the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼Ci</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32P</TIMEX>]-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> in ribosylation buffer. By this method, any further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX> ribosylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> can be identified 
          in vitro after 
          in vivo ribosylation, thus serving
          as a measure of the efficiency of the electroporation
          procedure for introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3 exoenzyme</ENAMEX> into HPB-ALL cells
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . As figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1Bdemonstrates</TIMEX>, electroporation of C3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transferase</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) prior to cell disruption
          prevented further ribosylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rho proteins</ENAMEX> in the
          cell lysates. The technique of electroporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> was
          very efficient, as even longer autoradiographic exposures
          of the gel did not demonstrate incorporation of [
          32P]-NAD (data not shown). Thus electroporation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exoenzyme</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> fully ribosylates Rho 
          in vivo , to the extent that no
          further 
          in vitro ribosylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> can be
          detected after cell lysis.
        
        
          Alteration of HPB-ALL morphology by C3
          exoenzyme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inactivation of Rho</ENAMEX> did not affect the constitutively
          high adhesion of HPB-ALL cells to the extracellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix protein fibronectin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fn</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPB-ALL</ENAMEX>
          cells are plated onto <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Î²1 integrin</NUMEX> substrate such as
          fibronectin, vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>),
          or even antibodies to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î±4Î²1</NUMEX> integrins, they respond by
          extending pseudopodia and displaying a highly flattened,
          spread morphology (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, panels <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 7, and 10</ENAMEX>, and ref
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ). However, electroporation of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C3</NUMEX> appeared to
          alter HPB-ALL morphology resulting in the extension of
          very fine branched finger-like cellular processes when
          cells were plated on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> integrin substrates Fn
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9</TIMEX>), or a mAb
          specific for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²1 integrins</NUMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>). This also
          occurred for another T cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSB-1</ENAMEX> (data not shown),
          and in activated primary T lymphocytes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Untreated HPB-ALL</ENAMEX>, mock electroporated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPB-ALL</ENAMEX>,
          or C3 treated HPB-ALL do not extend pseudopodia on the
          non-specific cell attachment substrate poly-L-lysine
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, panels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-15</NUMEX>), demonstrating the requirement
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">integrin</TIMEX> dependent signals in both the normal
          spreading morphology of HBP-ALL, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C3</TIMEX> induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphological</ENAMEX> changes in this cell type.
        
        
          RhoA immunolocalization in normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated
          HPB-ALL cells spreading on fibronectin
          Immunolocalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase RhoA</ENAMEX> was performed to
          determine if inactivation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX> exoenzyme caused spatial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redistribution of RhoA</ENAMEX> in HPB-ALL. As figure
          4demonstrates, untreated HPB-ALL cells display a diffuse
          staining pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX>, with small punctate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microclusters</ENAMEX> throughout the normal pseudopodial
          extensions (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, left panels, arrows). Staining with
          secondary antibody alone was negative (data not shown).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inactivation of Rho</ENAMEX> by electroporation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> exoenzyme
          did not seem to cause a large overall redistribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> in spread HPB-ALL. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RhoA</ENAMEX> appeared to be in
          relatively larger clusters distributed along the aberrant
          pseudopodial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with no diffuse staining observed
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, right panels, arrows).
        
        
          Altered pseudopodia are rich in filamentous
          actin
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX> is largely responsible for
          maintenance of cell shape in a variety of cell types, and
          this involves regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. To
          localize filamentous actin within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPB-ALL</ENAMEX>, cells adherent
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> were fixed and stained with TRITC-phalloidin.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> electroporated cells display rather diffuse
          filamentous actin staining in elongated pseudopodial
          processes that flatten and spread out on their termini,
          and there are multiple filopodia extending from these
          processes and from the cell body (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>, arrows).
          Cells that had been treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> exoenzyme however all
          contain highly enriched filamentous actin within the
          extended pseudopods. This is true on the substrates FN
          and anti<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Î²1 integrin mAb</NUMEX> (data not shown). In the C3
          electroporated cells, small filopodia extending from the
          cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> are absent, and multiple branched pseudopodial
          structures are largely enriched in filamentous actin
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>, arrows). Of interest, electroporation of C3
          in conjunction with FITC-labeled monomers of actin did
          not demonstrate incorporation of FITC-actin in the
          altered pseudopods at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early time</TIMEX> points (data not shown),
          suggesting that the filamentous actin in the altered
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudopods</ENAMEX> initially results from rearrangement of
          pre-formed actin filaments.
        
        
          Time lapse microscopy of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated cells
          In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fibroblast</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rho</ENAMEX> causes
          retraction of pre-formed pseudopods with a resultant
          deposition of parallel tracks of thin dendritic processes
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] , a phenotype ultimately resembling that seen in
          C3 treated HPB-ALL. The phenotype induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX> mediated
          ribosylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in HPB-ALL could result from either
          aberrant retraction of recently formed pseudopods, or
          altered pseudopodial extension. These possibilities were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX> using video time-lapse microscopy. Figure
          6demonstrates HPB-ALL spreading on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> over a period
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>, where images from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 10 minutes</TIMEX> were
          obtained from recorded videotape, followed by a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minute</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point. Untreated cells and mock electroporated cells
          demonstrate normal HPB-ALL cell spreading (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrows</ENAMEX>). They extend thick pseudopodia with fanned
          termini, and their cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are flattened and oval in
          shape. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C3</NUMEX> induced phenotype forms at the onset of
          cell spreading (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, see arrows). The finger-like
          extensions initially form from a rounded cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and
          elongate throughout the duration of the assay. The
          stellate projections are clearly delineated even at their
          termini, and the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> do not demonstrate a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flattened</ENAMEX>, oval, or spindle phenotype. Thus, the C3
          induced stellate phenotype is not primarily due to
          aberrant pseudopodial retraction, but an altered
          pseudopodial extension. Also of note was the effect of C3
          on the dynamic maintenance of pseudopodia. Under normal
          or control electroporation conditions, some of the VCAM-1
          adherent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> would retract pseudopodia, then form new
          extensions in different directions. This activity was
          clearly inhibited in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C3</TIMEX> treated cells. Once the
          aberrant finger-like projections were formed, no
          pseudopodial retraction was noted during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>
          period, and the cells became completely immobile.

        Discussion
        In the present study, we demonstrate that
        ADP-ribosylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPase Rho</ENAMEX> in HPB-ALL cells does
        not result in a decrease in constitutively high adhesion to
        the extracellular matrix component fibronectin. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inactivation of Rho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> does result in the aberrant
        extension of finger-like, branched dendritic projections in
        HBP-ALL cells when plated on the substrates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>,
        fibronectin, and mAb specific for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> integrins. Altered
        pseudopodial extension required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> integrin signaling, as
        C3 treated cells plated on the non-specific cell attachment
        factor poly-L-lysine did not extend dendritic like
        processes. Electroporation of polyclonal antibodies
        specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> mimicked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C3</TIMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> (data
        not shown). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C3</NUMEX> induced extensions were rich in
        filamentous actin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated HPB-ALL cell bodies
        apparently lacked filopodial actin microspikes, present in
        normal spreading cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunolocalization</ENAMEX> studies of RhoA
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated HBP-ALL cells spreading on fibronectin showed
        no gross differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RhoA</ENAMEX> distribution, however clusters
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> were more delineated along the finger-like
        dendritic processes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated cells. Thus,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional Rho</ENAMEX> is required for the proper extension and
        retraction of pseudopods in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> integrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>.
        A large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of work has described the morphological

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc42</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G25K</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RhoG</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rac1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rac2</TIMEX>, and TC10
        (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fibroblast</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, these GTPases
        have been proposed to act in a concerted hierarchy to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinately</ENAMEX> regulate distinct morphological features.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Filopodia</ENAMEX> formation of short filamentous actin microspikes
        gives way to membrane ruffling and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamellipodia</ENAMEX> formation,
        culminating in the organized production of actin stress
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. This has lead to the hypothesis that small GTP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding proteins</ENAMEX> act sequentially, in the GTPase cascade
        Cdc42â†’Racâ†’Rho [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Facilitating the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in
        regulation of cell activity has been the use of C3
        exoenzyme, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> from 
        Clostridium botulinum that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ADP-ribosylates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] and inactivates <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rho proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Although ribosylation of other Rho family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as
        Rac1 can occur with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , this seemed to be very weak
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In our work, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">electroporated</ENAMEX> into the T cell
        line HPB-ALL caused complete ADP-ribosylation of Rho
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~25 kDa</NUMEX>). Although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rac1 and Cdc42</TIMEX> were identified
        in western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blots</ENAMEX> of whole cell lysates prepared from the T
        cell lines HPB-ALL, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSB</ENAMEX> (data not shown), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PB</ENAMEX> human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes (data not shown), there was no detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ribosylation</ENAMEX> in the lower molecular weight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rac</ENAMEX> and Cdc42
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX> in HPB-ALL cells, indicating the
        specificity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX>.
        Previous reports have demonstrated that ADP-ribosylation
        of B-lymphoid cell lines by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX> treatment inhibits phorbol
        ester induced cellular homotypic aggregation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Also,
        phorbol ester and chemoattractant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-8</ENAMEX> and fMLP) induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pre-B</ENAMEX> lymphoblastoid adhesion to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> and neutrophil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> to fibrinogen was abrogated in a dose-dependent
        manner by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">C3 exoenzyme</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . This may indicate that in
        cells of hematopoietic lineages, the induction of an
        increased adhesive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> may be susceptible to regulation
        by Rho <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However, we have recently demonstrated
        that induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adhesion</ENAMEX> of primary T lymphocytes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibronectin</ENAMEX> is unaffected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> inactivation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> presented here suggests that constitutively high
        adhesion of HPB-ALL cells to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> integrin substrate is
        unaffected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX> treatment. Others have demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivation of Rho</ENAMEX> in monocytes promotes cellular adhesion
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> integrin substrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Static cell adhesion
        studies rely on a number of factors including integrin
        affinity regulation, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">integrin avidity</ENAMEX>/clustering, and shear
        resistant cell shape changes. Factors affecting adhesion
        can do so by regulating any number of these parameters.
        Thus the effects due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> inactivation on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion
        may not only influence one or more of these parameters, but
        also be cell type specific even amongst the cells of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">hematopoeitic</ENAMEX> lineage.
        The phenotype induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX>-ribosylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> appeared different than that induced in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblast</ENAMEX> models, where microinjection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX> results in
        fibroblast retraction of pseudopodia, with the cell body
        rounding up eventually to become non-adherent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Video time-lapse microscopy demonstrated the elongation of
        aberrant pseudopods in HPB-ALL cells plated on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VCAM-1</ENAMEX>, rather than an altered retraction of
        already formed pseudopods. These results suggest an altered
        pseudopodial extension although a defect in contractibility
        could be involved as a secondary mechanism for formation of
        aberrant processes. This phenotype also coincided with the
        complete loss of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motility</ENAMEX> in HPB-ALL, even though
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adhesion</ENAMEX> to substrate was not noticeably altered. It is
        also important to note that normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> induced aberrant
        HPB-ALL spreading on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fn</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> is dependent on signals
        generated through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> integrins, as both morphologies could
        be seen when untreated or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated HPB-ALL were plated on
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX> specific mAb <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33B6</TIMEX>. When these same cells are plated
        on the non-specific cell attachment factor poly-L-lysine,
        cells remain round and no spreading occurs. The elongated
        dendritic-like processes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated HPB-ALL cells were
        F-actin rich. This phenotype caused by inactivation of Rho
        is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes, however, Rho
        regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is not novel among
        cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">hematopoietic</ENAMEX> lineage. ADP-ribosylation of Rho
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in chemoattractant stimulated neutrophils [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX>
        ] and in both monocytic lines and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 38</NUMEX> ] results in actin filament polymerization. Although
        this once again highlights differences between the affects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> in fibroblasts and leukocytes, there may be
        commonalties amongst cells that do not form distinct actin
        stress <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, such as leukocytes and neuronal cells.
        ADP-ribosylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rho proteins</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3 exoenzyme</ENAMEX> prevents
        neurite retraction in the specialized growth cone of
        developing neurons, and in fact promotes neurite outgrowth
        in the same fashion as microinjection of purified dominant
        negative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T19N</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . In these instances, neuronal
        N1E-115 cell outgrowth induced by inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> was
        mimicked by microinjection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rac1</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdc42</NUMEX>-GST fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, and could be abolished by coinjection of dominant
        negative Cdc42 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T17Nor Rac1 T17N</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . From these
        results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> by
        C3 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exoenzyme</ENAMEX> treatment resulted in the activation of Rac1
        and Cdc42 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX>, suggesting the mutually exclusive
        function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rac1/Cdc42</ENAMEX>. Cdc42 has been implicated
        in the formation of small, actin-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">filopodia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ,
        which are similar to those seen on spread HPB-ALL cells
        (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) around the periphery of the cell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and
        extended pseudopods. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX> electroporation, HPB-ALL were
        allowed to spread on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VCAM-1</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>, and
        TRITC-phalloidin staining demonstrated the complete absence
        of fine filopodial structures. Given the morphologic
        similarity between neurite outgrowth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">N1E</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> cells and
        the aberrant pseudopodial extension of HPB-ALL when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RhoA</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inhibited with C3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">exoenzyme</ENAMEX>, it will be interesting to
        determine if other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GTPases</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rac</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc42</ENAMEX> are
        activated to promote this phenotype after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3</TIMEX> treatment of
        HPB-ALL cells. The thick actin rich stellate projections
        emanating from the cell body of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3</ENAMEX> electroporated HPB-ALL
        may be the result of condensation of filopodia, where Cdc42
        may be induced into a highly active <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Actin filament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongation</ENAMEX> would continue and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retraction</ENAMEX> of
        filamentous actin would be abrogated. This could occur by
        the release of limited effector molecules shared between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX>, possibilities that are currently under
        investigation.
        The immunolocalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA</ENAMEX> in normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C3</ENAMEX> treated
        cells did not appear drastically different in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RhoA</ENAMEX> was
        apparent in both normal and aberrant pseudopodial
        extensions. The notable exception was that clusters of RhoA
        appeared less diffuse in the altered pseudopods of C3
        treated cells (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADP</ENAMEX>-ribosylation of Rho
        does not significantly alter the subcellular distribution
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RhoA, Rho</ENAMEX> activity is inhibited. This is thought to
        prevent activation of downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Rho</ENAMEX> targets required for
        normal integrin dependent morphological changes. A number
        of potential downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rho</ENAMEX> effector molecules have been
        identified recently. These include p150 RhoA-binding kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î± and Î²</ENAMEX> (p150 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROKÎ±</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] , p160 Rho-associated
        coiled-coil containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rho-p160ROCK</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ]
        , p164 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p120 protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> (p120 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKN</ENAMEX>)
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45</NUMEX> ] , and PKC-related kinase-2 (PRK-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> specifically bind to the GTP bound form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX>,
        except for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PRK-2</ENAMEX>, which can bind both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rac GTPases</ENAMEX>.
        Interestingly, inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rho-p160ROCK</ENAMEX> has recently been
        shown to give similar lymphocyte morphology as inhibition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rho with C3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Another interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> may
        be p120 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKN</ENAMEX>, as recent studies have established that PKN
        phosphorylates cytoskeletal intermediate filaments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ]
        and is directly linked to the cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±-actinin</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] . Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKN</ENAMEX> may be
        involved in relating cytoplasmic signals to the nucleus,
        for in response to stress, nuclear translocation of PKN
        occurs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . This is particularly important in light of
        previous work demonstrating that inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in
        peripheral blood T lymphocytes inhibits costimulatory
        signals up-regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-2</ENAMEX> production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Future
        experiments will focus on determining the relationship of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho GTPases</ENAMEX> and the regulation of T cell morphology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 51</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inactivation of Rho</ENAMEX> results in an active elongation of
        actin rich, finger-like dendritic processes dependent on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²1</NUMEX>
        integrin signaling. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> activity is required for T
        lymphocyte spreading morphologies, and is required for T
        lymphocyte motility. In static cell adhesion assays,
        however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> activity is not required to maintain
        constitutively high levels of adhesion to fibronectin.
        Further study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> and it's related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">downstream effector</ENAMEX> molecules, will be important in
        elucidating mechanisms regulating the lymphocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> and thus T cell function.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Reagents
          Poly-L-lysine was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). Fn was affinity purified from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 ml</NUMEX> of
