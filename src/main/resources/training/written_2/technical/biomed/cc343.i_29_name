        As initially described by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Poiseuille's law</ENAMEX>, resistance
        to flow is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> provided by a vessel or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">circulatory</ENAMEX> bed which permits a given pressure differential
        to produce a unit flow. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcribed</ENAMEX> to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hemodynamics</ENAMEX>,
        systemic vascular resistance (SVR) can be measured from the
        differential pressure between the mean arterial pressure
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>) and the central venous pressure (CVP) divided by the
        flow, ie cardiac output (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>). Although many clinical
        conditions can cause a low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>, septic shock remains the
        most common cause and usually results in a severe decrease
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic shock who
        are aggressively volume loaded, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> is initially normal
        or elevated. Therefore, hypotension results from reduced
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> with normal or elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO.</ENAMEX> This form
        of shock results from maldistribution of blood flow to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, usually from acute vasodilatation without
        concomitant expansion of the intravascular volume. While
        distributive shock can also be caused by anaphylaxis, drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ingestion</ENAMEX>, neurogenic injury, and adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX>,
        these conditions are seen with less frequency in the
        intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a hemodynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with
        low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> is often considered synonymous of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, and other
        conditions associated with a low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> may not be
        considered.
        There are minimal data in the medical literature
        assessing the frequency or outcome of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        distributive shock that is unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>. Since we could find no prior studies in
        the literature assessing the etiology and outcome of
        hypotensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>, we reviewed our
        experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing hemodynamic monitoring
        in the medical intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of a large university
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>. The purpose of this study was to determine the
        different causes of low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>, identify prognostic factors,
        and analyze the mortality of these various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        After approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas Health Science Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>,
        medical records of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to the medical
        intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Hospital</ENAMEX> between
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990-1995</TIMEX> were reviewed. All the charts of patients
        undergoing pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery catheterization</ENAMEX> were
        identified. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with a recorded SVR <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 800</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dynes Ã—s/cm 5were</ENAMEX> analyzed. The main indication for
        pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery catheterization</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in this study
        was unexplained hypotension after volume challenge. Any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with an unclear etiology for hypotension or any
        patient requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼ g/kg/min dopamine</ENAMEX>
        underwent pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery catheterization</ENAMEX> and was reviewed
        for this study. Anxiolytics, sedatives, and neuromuscular
        blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are administered by protocol and have
        minimal or no direct effects on hemodynamics or histamine
        release. Cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and urine were obtained on all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; cultures of sputum, pleural fluid, ascitic fluid,
        and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained as clinically
        indicated. Toxicological screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and urine for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> was performed on admission if the etiology of
        hypotension was in question. Serum cortisol level
        determination was performed on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving
        exogenous corticosteroids or in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with known risk
        factors for adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hematologic</ENAMEX> and blood
        chemistry determinations, arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood gases</ENAMEX>, routine
        urinalysis, and serial electrocardiograms were obtained on
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Mean systemic, right atrial, and pulmonary artery
        pressures and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thermodilution cardiac outputs</ENAMEX> were measured
        every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> h in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Derived hemodynamic variables
        were calculated as follows: cardiac index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">l/min/m 2</ENAMEX>) =
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>/body surface area; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dynes Ã— s/cm 5</ENAMEX>)=(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">80Ã— MAP</ENAMEX>)/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>;
        and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI)=<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SVR</ENAMEX>/body
        surface area. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> received vasopressors to maintain
        MAP above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> mmHg. The set of hemodynamic data with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lowest SVR</ENAMEX> was selected for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        All historical, clinical, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, microbiologic, and
        hemodynamic data were studied. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were divided into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on the following parameters: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) positive
        blood culture; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) temperature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¥ 38.1Â°C</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¤ 36Â°C</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> counts (WBCs) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â‰¥ 12000/mm 3or â‰¤ 4000/mm 3</ENAMEX>; and
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) obvious source of infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 1</ENAMEX> (definite <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>)
        had positive blood cultures and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more criteria; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (probable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>) had an obvious source of infection and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more additional criteria; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 3 (possible <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>)
        had fever and leukocytosis or leukopenia with no obvious
        source of infection nor positive blood culture; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 4
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nonseptic</NUMEX>) had none of the criteria.
        The clinical course, laboratory findings, hemodynamics,
        and intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> mortality were compared between the
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are expressed as mean Â± standard
        deviation. Clinical and hemodynamic variables were compared
        with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test and by analysis of variance
        to assess statistical significance between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Logistic
        regression analysis was performed comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> and death
        using a univariant analysis.
        Mortality was assessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> rank sum test. A 
        P value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â‰¤ 0.05</NUMEX> was considered
        statistically significant.
      
      
        Results
        Fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were included in the study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 1</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">definite sepsis</ENAMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group 2</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">probable sepsis</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with possible <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 4
        contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had no evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. The
        mean age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Â±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13.6years</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thirty-four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 Â± 20 mmHg</NUMEX> at the moment the hemodynamic values
        were chosen. The overall mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9.2 Â±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6.18l/min</ENAMEX>, and
        the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.7l/min/m 2</ENAMEX>. The overall mean SVR
        was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">435 Â± 180 dynes</NUMEX> Ã— s/cm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVRI</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">785</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">325</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dynes Ã— s/cm 5</ENAMEX>. Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVRI</ENAMEX> was reviewed for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subgroup</ENAMEX> and not found to be different from the analysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>; therefore, only data for SVR are presented.
        There were no statistically significant differences in
        age, sex, or admission temperature among the different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groups 1 and 2</ENAMEX>) met the
        criteria for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">445</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Â± 168 dynes Ã— s/cm 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10.86 Â±</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5.22l/min</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5.08 Â± 1.64l/min/m</ENAMEX> 2for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The overall mortality
        in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> classified as having the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>, the lung was
        the primary site of infection in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were considered nonseptic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 4). This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> had no source of infection, alteration in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, leukocytosis, or leukopenia. The mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemodynamic</ENAMEX> values for this group were: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">435</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dynes Ã— s/cm 5</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.23</NUMEX> Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4.24l/min</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.72</NUMEX> Â±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1.9l/min/m 2</ENAMEX>. The mortality was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>. There were no
        statistically significant differences in any hemodynamic
        values nor in mortality between the nonseptic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groups 1 and 2</ENAMEX>).
        The nonseptic group included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        intra-abdominal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> with decompensated cirrhosis,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> with acute pancreatitis), one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with adrenal
        insufficiency, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with unclear etiologies
        for hypotension and low SVR (idiopathic). The mortality in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with decompensated intra-abdominal disease was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>). Additionally, no statistically
        significant difference in any of the hemodynamic values or
        mortality was identified between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> when
        analyzed individually (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> met the criteria for the extreme
        hyperdynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (EHS). In the literature [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EHS</ENAMEX> is
        defined as an SVR below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> dynes Ã— s/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cm</ENAMEX> 5and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> above
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7l/min/m 2</ENAMEX>. The mean hemodynamic values for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        this study with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EHS</ENAMEX> were: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">327Â± 85</NUMEX> dynes Ã— s/cm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5; CO</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 12.13 Â± 3.31l/min</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.98</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">l/min/m 2</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX>
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a diagnosis of underlying cirrhosis.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> within this group were diagnosed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> with possible <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        were nonseptic. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a statistically significant
        higher mortality (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>) than those patient
        without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EHS</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). A univariant logistic
        regression was performed analyzing the level of reduction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> and mortality. A statistically significant
        relationship was found between these variables ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.025</NUMEX>). For every reduction in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">50dynes Ã— s/cm 5</ENAMEX>, there was a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> increase in
        mortality (odds ratio = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>; range = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.022</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.434</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sepsis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX> were the most common
        etiologies of a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> in this study. Although many
        studies have found urinary or intra-abdominal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> to be
        the most common cause of low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], the lung was the
        primary site of infection in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Septic shock, the leading cause of intensive care unit
        mortality, is caused by systemic activation of the
        inflammatory cascade. Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, including
        cytokines, kinins, complement, coagulation factors, and
        eicosanoids, are activated or systematically released,
        resulting in profound disturbances of cardiovascular and
        organ system function. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX>, particularly tumor
        necrosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (TNF), interleukin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, platelet
        activating factor, and prostaglandins, are thought to
        mediate the reduced peripheral vascular resistance seen in
        septic shock [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parker</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] studied serial
        cardiovascular variables in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with septic shock. A low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> was seen in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and nonsurvivors; however,
        persistently low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h was a strong predictor of
        mortality. This study demonstrated that the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>) who die of septic shock have a persistently
        low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>, while a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">smaller percentage</NUMEX> die of low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) or
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple organ failure</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>) after hemodynamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> of shock. Although we did not evaluate serial
        hemodynamic profiles in this study, our data identify a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EHS</ENAMEX> who demonstrate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dynes Ã— s/cm</ENAMEX> 5and a mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12l</TIMEX>/min. As with patients
        in prior studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> demonstrated a
        significantly higher mortality. Although the mechanisms
        relating to the difference in mortality are unknown, it has
        been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with "complicated" shock
        (defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiorgan failure</ENAMEX>) have greater distortions of
        cardiorespiratory patterns relative to the degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotension</ENAMEX> and that this is associated with a higher
        mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]
        Our study demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> are the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting
        with hypotension and a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> in the medical intensive
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> only represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in our study. While many of the remaining patients
        had some evidence supporting the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> (eg
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>, leukocytosis), they lacked an identifiable source of
        infection, and the exact etiology of their hypotension
        remains unknown. More significantly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one-quarter</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) in this study developed hypotension and
        a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> without any evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a
        high mortality (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>), similar to the remaining patients
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>). There were no significant differences in the
        clinical or hemodynamic parameters between the nonseptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The
        frequency of nonseptic causes of a low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> suggest that
        clinicians must be aware of conditions other than sepsis
        that have either been well documented (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) or reported
        to induce a reduction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nonseptic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in this study
        with hypotension and a low SVR was found to be patients
        with decompensated cirrhosis. Although occult infections
        should not be excluded, none of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had fever,
        leukocytosis, an identifiable site of infection, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in the peritoneal fluid. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cirrhosis</ENAMEX> often present with systemic hemodynamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disturbances</ENAMEX>, including hypotension, low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>, and a reduced
        sensitivity to vasoconstrictors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The precise
        mechanisms of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hemodynamic disorders</ENAMEX> have not yet been
        clearly elucidated. Excessive production of vasodilators,
        peripheral shunts, and increased levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> in
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may contribute to the hyperdynamic state
        observed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>].
        A recent study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsumoto</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">decompensated liver cirrhosis</ENAMEX> had higher
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exhaled nitric oxide</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        compensated cirrhosis, chronic liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, or controls.
        The decompensated cirrhotics had a significantly higher CO
        and a lower SVR than the compensated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally, a positive correlation was found between the
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a
        low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> had decompensated liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> as the presumed
        etiology of their hypotension. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sepsis group</ENAMEX> had hypotension with a clinical
        diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; however,
        the lack of positive cultures, or any other evidence of
        infection, suggest that decompensated liver disease may
        have played a significant role in their hypotension.
        Pancreatitis was found to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most common
        cause of low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without evidence of infection.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had necrotizing pancreatitis, with one of
        these having evidence of hemorrhage into the pancreas.
        Hemodynamic manifestations of pancreatitis include a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normodynamic</ENAMEX> or hypodynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, usually present in acute
        interstitial pancreatitis and commonly associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypovolemia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pancreatitis</ENAMEX> can also present as a
        hyperdynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> and a low SVR as described
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Di Carlo</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. This hyperdynamic state
        is another manifestation of the severity of acute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pancreatitis</ENAMEX> and is seen mostly in necrotizing pancreatitis
        with or without hemorrhage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Severe pancreatitis may
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mimic sepsis syndrome</ENAMEX> or septic shock despite the absence
        of any infectious site. The mechanisms responsible for
        pancreatic shock have not been elucidated; however, an
        inflammatory cascade generalized by cytokines and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> is
        felt to be the most likely cause of this process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>].
        Adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX> was found in one of our patients
        with no evidence of infection. Unfortunately, cortisol
        levels and adrenocorticotrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> (ACTH) response was
        not routinely measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with infection, and
        adrenal insufficiency may have been underestimated in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Adrenal insufficiency may present as a hypodynamic,
        normodynamic, or hyperdynamic state [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The hypodynamic
        state is usually seen early in adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX> and is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with volume depletion from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, vomiting,
        and decreased reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubule.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> may also be decreased in adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX> as the
        result of the myofibrillar adenosine triphosphate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>)
        depletion seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">glucocorticoid deficiency</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        Intravenous fluid therapy most often increases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decreases SVR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with adrenal crisis. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are usually separated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> by
        a baseline cortisol level below <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10Î¼ g/dl</ENAMEX> or an inadequate
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with septic
        shock had baseline cortisol of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">22Î¼ g/dl</ENAMEX> and no response to
        the cosyntropin stimulation test. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> could not be
        weaned off high dose norepinephrine and dopamine until
        intravenous corticosteroids were instituted. Normal values
        for basal and stimulated cortisol levels are derived from
        the adrenal response of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">healthy individuals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
        experiencing the severe stress of critical illness
        demonstrate higher than normal amounts of circulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortisol</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with critical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> have minimal
        or no ACTH stimulation above their baseline cortisol levels
        and may be unable to respond to additional physiologic
        stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Several reports suggest a significant number
        of critically ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may have unrecognized adrenal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insufficiency</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> cases of idiopathic hypotension with low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> were
        identified in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> case was felt to be related
        to possible anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction but was
        not well documented. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Silverman</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] reported a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who
        developed anaphylactic shock secondary to penicillin 7days
        postmyocardial infarction; the hemodynamic parameters
        showed a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> and MAP with an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Moss</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] reported the opposite
        hemodynamic profile in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with anaphylactic shock
        secondary to succinycholine. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed a low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> and a high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> which correlated with increased levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histamine</ENAMEX> and catecholamines. Although there are minimal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> data, animal studies suggest there is an initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hypodynamic</ENAMEX> state secondary to severe extravasation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> into the tissues followed by a hyperdynamic state
        after fluid resuscitation.
        Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> case of hypotension with a low SVR presented
        in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction. Although
        cardiogenic shock presents with a high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> and low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>, some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest that, rarely, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may present with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> of low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX>. McCriskin 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] reported a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a
        left ventricular pseudoaneurysm postmyocardial infarct with
        a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> and no evidence of infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costantin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]
        developed an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and demonstrated a subset
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with a hyperdynamic state after coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occlusion</ENAMEX>; however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ross</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] were unable to confirm
        these results using another animal model. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], in one of the original
        hemodynamic descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> after myocardial
        infarction, did not identify any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a
        hyperdynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Another recently described cause of low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is the "<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasoplegic syndrome</ENAMEX>". This
        syndrome occurs within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6h</TIMEX> after cardiac surgery using
        extracorporeal circulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. The incidence has been
        estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 0.4 and 5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing
        cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>]. The etiology is unclear but has not been associated
        with increased levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> or endotoxin.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a low SVR classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiopathic</ENAMEX> had
        a history of significant alcohol consumption. Their initial
        hemodynamic parameters showed a low SVR with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> which
        rapidly resolved after intravenous thiamine and
        broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is possible that this case
        represents a variant of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">beriberi heart disease</ENAMEX>. This rare
        but treatable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should be considered in every patient
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX> and a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX>. The fulminant
        form known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shosin</ENAMEX> beriberi presents as a high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> state
        with extremely high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> and a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> which rapidly responds
        to thiamine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34, 35</TIMEX>].
        The remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in the idiopathic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had no
        explanation for their low <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SVR syndrome</ENAMEX>. Review of the
        literature shows many causes of a low SVR (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 3and 4</ENAMEX>),
        and it is possible that one of these diagnosis was missed
        by the clinicians caring for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had
        normal urine drug abuse screens and a normal serum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetaminophen</ENAMEX> level. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salicylate</ENAMEX> level was not obtained.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leatherman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmitz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] reported a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who became accidentally intoxicated with
        salicylates with clinical, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and hemodynamic
        features of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, but without bacteriological evidence.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX> were measured and
        found to be significantly elevated. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX> including tricyclic
        antidepressants, anesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX>. Recently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nguyen</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] reported hyperdynamic
        shock caused by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoglobulin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> were not detected and
        complement levels were normal, suggesting a mechanism other
        than anaphylaxis. Our drug screen should have identified
        tricyclic antidepressants or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX> in the urine;
        however, a careful drug history was not elicited in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Although other conditions such as head injury [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39, 40</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Paget's disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42, 43</TIMEX>], arteriovenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fistula</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46</TIMEX>], multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myeloma</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>], thyrotoxicosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>], and spinal cord injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>]
        have been reported to produce a low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX>, this patient
        lacked any clinical evidence suggesting one of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnoses</ENAMEX>; his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypotension</ENAMEX> resolved spontaneously.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In summary, we describe a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVR</ENAMEX> below <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800dynesÃ—s/cm 5</ENAMEX>, and a subgroup of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> non-septic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">patents</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) with a similar mortality. This study
        emphasizes the importance of considering other conditions
        besides <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting with hypotension and
        a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SVR</ENAMEX>.
