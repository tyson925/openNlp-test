        The replicative polymerase of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">herpes simplex</ENAMEX> virus (HSV)
        is comprised of catalytic (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX>) and processivity subunits
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">UL42</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 11</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HSV Pol</ENAMEX> is responsible, in concert with
        other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, for regulating the fidelity of DNA
        replication by selecting the correct nucleotides for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incorporation</ENAMEX> and by proofreading or editing mispaired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> subunit contains intrinsic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-5' exonuclease activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        region of the polypeptide encoding this function is highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in other polymerases, containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> segments
        referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exo</ENAMEX> motifs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 26</ENAMEX> ] .
        Thymidine kinase polypeptide (TK) is required for the
        activation of some antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleoside</ENAMEX> analogs e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acyclovir</ENAMEX> (ACV) and penciclovir (PCV), in order to inhibit
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSV</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> mutations may impair
        activation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and confer a drug-resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. The natural phenomenon of spontaneous mutation,
        which occurs in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> selection, results in
        the accumulation of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six to eight</NUMEX> TK-deficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 4plaque-forming viruses in virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that have never been exposed to selective
        pressure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 10 12</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2</ENAMEX> clinical isolates
        were shown to have a higher frequency of spontaneous
        mutations resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30</NUMEX>-fold,
        compared to HSV-1 isolates, and the majority of these
        mutations are in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tk</ENAMEX> . Consistent with this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, HSV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> strains also exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately</NUMEX> a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20- to 80-fold</NUMEX> higher spontaneous mutation rate to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cidofovir</ENAMEX> (HPMPC), an inhibitor of HSV <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX>, resistance
        compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, these
        naturally-occuring mutations are not unique to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX> substrates as detected with
        antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents ACV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCV</ENAMEX>, but were extended with the
        direct <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> inhibitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPMPC</ENAMEX>, to other loci, most likely 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> .
        Since mutations within the viral 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pol gene</ENAMEX> have been previously shown
        to affect spontaneous viral mutation rates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , the
        higher frequency of errors associated with type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> viruses
        may be an inherent property of the type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX>. To assess
        the direct contribution of polymerases from virus types 1
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to mutation frequency, recombinant HSV expressing a
        type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> within a type 1 viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> were generated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> transfer and examined along with a panel of other
        HSV isolates in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutagenesis assays.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to
          generate recombinant viruses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> viruses were
          successfully obtained for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pols</ENAMEX> except wild type HSV-1
          SC16 and the low error rate or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antimutator</ENAMEX> HSV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r5</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] . The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol -recombinant</ENAMEX> viruses were
          plaque-purified and the 
          pol genes completely sequenced
          along with those of their parental viruses to confirm the
          recombination event. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX>, HSV-2
          SB5, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2 6652</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2 83D</ENAMEX>, had 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> sequences consistent with wild
          type isolates found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GeneBank</ENAMEX> and were recently
          characterized [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX>, a virus which
          showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300- to 700</NUMEX>-fold higher error rate than HSV-1
          SC16 by the 
          tk mutagenesis assay previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] , was found to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mutations compared to
          the other HSV-2 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pols</ENAMEX> , with one change residing in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">region VII</ENAMEX> which is shared among diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> polymerases
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). No amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> changes were identified within
          the proofreading (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exo</ENAMEX>) domains. The high frequency of
          errors generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX> did not appear to preclude
          its ability to replicate efficiently in culture. In fact,
          no significant differences in the growth curve of
          parental and recombinant viruses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (compared
          to wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2 SB5</ENAMEX>) were apparent (data not
          shown).
        
        
          tkmutagenesis assay
          The proportions of virus resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACV</ENAMEX> or PCV,
          which arise during amplification of virus stocks in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> selection, were measured by the method
          described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Plating efficiency
          assays were performed in MRC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cells at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Î¼g/ml ACV,</ENAMEX>
          which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-</NUMEX>times higher than the average IC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSV-1 SVC16</TIMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACV</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-</NUMEX>times higher than the average IC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX>.
          Notably, whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> HSV-2 parental viruses had
          spontaneous mutation frequencies significantly higher
          than HSV-1 isolates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the frequency of errors
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol -recombinant</ENAMEX> viruses expressing
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2 Pol</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an HSV-1</TIMEX> background were
          indistinguishable from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSV-1 SC16</TIMEX> when tested in MRC-5
          cells. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the type 2 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol -recombinant</ENAMEX> viruses, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SB5PR</TIMEX>,
          6652PR and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">83DPR</ENAMEX>, had error rates equal to or slightly
          lower than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HSV-1 SC16</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.05%</NUMEX>). Results were similar for
          plating efficiency with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCV</ENAMEX> (data not shown). In this
          assay, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2 Pol</ENAMEX> does not appear to be solely
          responsible for the difference in drug-resistant
          spontaneous 
          tk mutations observed between HSV-1
          and HSV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> strains.
          Interestingly, unlike the other 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol -recombinant</ENAMEX> viruses, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757PR</TIMEX>,
          containing the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> coding region from the
          supermutator clinical isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX>, retained a high
          spontaneous mutation frequency. This recombinant virus
          showed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-fold increase in mutation frequency
          compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HSV-1</NUMEX> SC16 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This increase in errors
          is most likely the direct result of the mutations
          identified within the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> coding region and suggests that
          this virus may indeed possess a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> defect in replication
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX>. The fact that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">6757PR</NUMEX> mutation frequency was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>, whilst parental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20-28%</NUMEX>, implicates
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX>/template or other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in modulating
          spontaneous mutations.
        
        
          Drug-independent mutation frequency using non-HSV
          DNA
          To eliminate any contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> selection or 
          tk gene template on the spontaneous
          mutation frequency in the 
          tk mutagenesis assay, non
          drug-selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">HSV replication-dependent mutations</ENAMEX> within
          an unrelated prokaryotic gene were measured using a LacZ
          shuttle plasmid assay. This assay employed transfection
          of a plasmid containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">230 bp SmaI</ENAMEX> fragment of ori 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> , the HSV origin of replication, and
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">LacZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene, into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vero</ENAMEX> cells. This plasmid was
          confirmed to generate DpnI-resistant progeny in Vero
          cells upon superinfection with the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2</ENAMEX> (data not shown). After superinfection, 
          DpnI -resistant (non-methylated;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicated</ENAMEX>) plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was rescued in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . In the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X-Gal</ENAMEX>,
          bacterial colonies which turn blue do not contain
          mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LacZ coding</NUMEX> region.
          However, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> remaining white contain mutations to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impair LacZ</ENAMEX> expression.
          Mutations can be introduced during replication by the
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or also by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutagenic</ENAMEX> processes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> and viral infection. Since the process of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transfection</ENAMEX> is often mutagenic, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pSV110</TIMEX> was transfected
          into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vero</ENAMEX> cells, mock-infected and rescued into bacteria
          to determine background frequency of mutation from the
          experimental process. Transfection was found to confer a
          mutation frequency less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.002%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>) after analyzing non-DpnI
          treated samples. No <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were recovered when treating
          the rescued <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DpnI</ENAMEX>. Moreover, to ensure that viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>, and not simply the process of viral
          infection, is responsible for the mutations in a rescued
          plasmid, a control transfection-superinfection was
          performed using the 
          pol mutant, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HP66</TIMEX>, which is unable
          to replicate. The mutation frequency contributed directly
          from the process of viral infection was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.12%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">335</ENAMEX> in
          over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>) after analyzing non-DpnI treated
          samples. Less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were recovered when
          treating the rescued <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DpnI</ENAMEX>. The data presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2was</ENAMEX> normalized by subtracting the mutation
          frequency for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HP66</TIMEX> infection (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.12 %</NUMEX>).
          The relative mutation frequency for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> tested in the non-HSV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> mutagenesis assay are
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Consistent with recent data from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hwang et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r5</ENAMEX> showed a minor increase in
          mutation frequency, compared with wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The presence of an antimutator phenotype
          with this viral polymerase in the 
          tk mutagenesis assay was not
          apparent when using the non-HSV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> mutagenesis assay,
          and therefore phenotype-labelling may be dependent upon
          both the assay method and/or the target gene. Moreover,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2</ENAMEX> viruses and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX> viruses
          in this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">LacZ</ENAMEX> phenotypic assay had mutation frequencies
          similar or below that of wild type HSV-1 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SC16</TIMEX>. Thus, the
          high proportion of errors associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> viruses
          appears specific to the 
          tk mutagenesis assay.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX>, although not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757PR</TIMEX>, conferred a slightly
          higher proportion of mutations in non-HSV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the
          plasmid assay, than wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2</ENAMEX>, consistent
          with a mutator phenotype. Sequencing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> encoded
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX> confirmed several residue changes which
          may contribute to the higher error rate, although the
          direct relationship of these individual mutations within
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol</ENAMEX> coding region to decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> has not been confirmed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It remains
          unclear whether a conserved residue change (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lys</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">943</NUMEX>) in region <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">VII</ENAMEX>, a motif purported to participate in
          the recognition of the PPi and nucleotide substrates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          ] , or whether one or more of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> residue
          changes identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX> 
          pol cooperate to affect mutation
          frequency.
        
        
          Anisomorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> conformations
          Reiterated sequence elements are often observed to
          form an unwound <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">S1 nuclease-sensitive DNA conformation</ENAMEX>,
          termed anisomorphic or left-handed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, when present in
          negatively supercoiled plasmids [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 24</NUMEX> ] .
          Nuclease-sensitive secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> within the HSV
          origin of replication are believed to be recognized by
          the viral origin binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and mutations that
          reduce this complex formation in vitro also reduce viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>, thereby indicating that localized torsional
          strain may occur during viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The
          
          tk mutagenesis assay measures
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication-dependent</ENAMEX> mutation frequency within the 
          tk gene, whereas the non-HSV DNA
          mutagenesis assay measures errors within a bacterial LacZ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> pUC-based plasmids were examined for the
          potential to form S1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nuclease</ENAMEX> sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>: pTK1
          which contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kb</ENAMEX> HSV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> fragment including the 
          tk coding region, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pTK2</ENAMEX> containing a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3.7 Kb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2 DNA</ENAMEX> fragment including the 
          tk coding region, and pLacZ which
          contains the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kb LacZ</ENAMEX> coding region. These negatively
          supercoiled plasmids were treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nuclease</ENAMEX> or
          mock-treated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> min. After removal of the nuclease,
          the plasmids were linearized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HindIII</ENAMEX>. Figure 2shows
          that treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pTK1</ENAMEX> and pLacZ with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">S1 nuclease</ENAMEX> did not
          alter the restriction enzyme profile, suggesting that in
          this assay, the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nuclease</ENAMEX>-sensitive
          structures was below the level of detection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lanes 3-6</ENAMEX>). However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pTK2</TIMEX> was readily digested with S1
          nuclease, which resulted in the appearance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> novel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bands</ENAMEX> suggesting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential nuclease-hypersensitive
          sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, lane 2</ENAMEX>). Additional restriction mapping
          studies suggest that the hypersensitive regions are
          within the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA fragment</ENAMEX>, and not in pUC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The 
        tk mutagenesis assay has been
        utilized by ourselves and others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 13</NUMEX> ] to determine
        both frequency and spectrum of mutations in the HSV 
        tk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> following selection for drug
        resistance. In this study, we have extended the findings of
        previous work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] by using 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pol -recombinant</ENAMEX> viruses to examine
        mutation frequency in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSV</ENAMEX>. Specifically, this study
        evaluated the contribution of type 2 polymerase to mutation
        frequency when measured by the 
        tk mutagenesis and non-HSV DNA
        mutagenesis assays.
        The control viruses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2 6757</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-1 PAA r5</ENAMEX>,
        demonstrated mutator or antimutator phenotypes,
        respectively, in the 
        tk mutagenesis assay, but not in the
        non-HSV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> mutagenesis assay. Thus, classification of a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pol gene</ENAMEX> as mutator (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX>) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antimutator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">r5</ENAMEX>) is not a general characteristic, but
        is likely dependent upon the assay method and target gene.
        This observation is consistent with the recent report of
        high mutation frequency within the 
        SupF gene upon replication by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAA</ENAMEX> r5
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Since the control viruses described above functioned as
        expected in the tk mutagenesis assay, recombinant viruses
        expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> polymerase within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an HSV-1</TIMEX> genome were
        also examined. Interestingly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> wild type HSV-2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerases</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6652</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83D and SB5</TIMEX>) showed mutation frequencies
        similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-1 SC16</ENAMEX>, rather than their parental virus,
        when placed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an HSV-1</TIMEX> genome. Only HSV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX>
        maintained a high error rate (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-fold</NUMEX>) over that of HSV-1
        SC16, when placed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an HSV-1</TIMEX> genome. However, the
        mutation frequency of this recombinant virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2 6757PR</ENAMEX>)
        was not completely penetrant when compared to the parental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6757</TIMEX> virus, which showed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>-fold higher percent of
        resistant mutants compared to HSV-1 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SC16</TIMEX>.
        An important distinguishing factor between the 
        tk mutagenesis and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LacZ</ENAMEX> test systems
        is the use of antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">selectors</ENAMEX> to measure mutation
        frequency. Silent mutations within the 
        tk gene that do not impair
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents</ENAMEX>, or mutations resulting
        in lethality of the virus, would escape detection as a
        mutation in the 
        tk mutagenesis assay. Futhermore, the
        DNA sequence being replicated is unique between these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and this could contribute to the differences in
        mutation frequency between assay systems. The demonstration
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nuclease-sensitive sites</ENAMEX> within the type 2 viral
        genome overlapping the tk coding region, and the absence of
        such sites in the type 1 viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, suggest that local
        topology may be different between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these HSV-1</TIMEX> and HSV-2.
        Although the potential contribution of this
        supercoiling-induced phenomenon to modulate mutation
        frequency during viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> is unclear, it could
        partially explain why the type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> polymerases confer a high
        mutation frequency to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSV-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> and a low mutation
        frequency when placed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an HSV-1</TIMEX> genome. Changes in
        local topology could contribute to polymerase slippage and
        the incorporation of errors.
        The inability of type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> viruses to confer a higher
        mutation rate than type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> viruses in the non-HSV DNA
        mutagenesis assay is consistent with the absence of S1
        nuclease hypersensitive sites in the LacZ gene fragment.
        Furthermore, the HSV-2 
        tk sequence used herein contained
        almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-C content, compared to the HSV-1 
        tk which has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or C.
        Melting temperature alone may not contribute to the
        difference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1</TIMEX> nuclease sensitivity. However, alignment
        of the 
        tk sequences showed that the type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least eight</NUMEX> distinct stretches containing
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 7 and 13</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">G-C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>, whereas the overlapping region
        in the type 1 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tk</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or less <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-C <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>. This
        differential in more extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-C rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> supports
        the observations reported herein.
        The data presented herein clearly demonstrate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymerase</ENAMEX> alone may not account for the high mutation
        frequency associated with type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> viruses in the tk
        mutagenesis assay. In addition to the potential impact of
        target sequence and secondary structure topology on
        mutation frequency, other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replicative proteins</ENAMEX>
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> accessory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TK</ENAMEX>, dUTPase, and
        uracil-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA glycosylase</ENAMEX> may cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pol</ENAMEX> to modulate
        polymerase repair and nucleotide selection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 19 23</NUMEX> ]
