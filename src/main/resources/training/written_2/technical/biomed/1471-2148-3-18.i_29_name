        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arsenic</ENAMEX> is a toxic element that is found in both natural
        environments such as geothermal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">springs</TIMEX>, and in sites
        contaminated by a number of industries. Inorganic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX>
        exists primarily in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> valence states: arsenite (As 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> ) and arsenate (As 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX> , or the arsenate ion AsO 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 3-</ENAMEX>). Both forms are toxic to
        microorganisms, with arsenite disrupting enzyme function,
        and arsenate behaving as a phosphate analog and interfering
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate uptake</ENAMEX> and utilization [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Microorganisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms for
        coping with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic toxicity</ENAMEX>, including minimizing the
        amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> that enters the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (e.g. through
        increased specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate uptake</ENAMEX>, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ),
        arsenite oxidation through the activity of arsenite oxidase
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , or peroxidation reactions with membrane lipids [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microorganisms utilize arsenic</ENAMEX> in metabolism,
        either as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal electron acceptor</ENAMEX> in dissimilatory
        arsenate respiration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] or as an electron donor
        in chemoautotrophic arsenite oxidation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . However,
        the most well-characterized microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX>
        detoxification pathway involves the 
        ars operon [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 13</ENAMEX> ] .
        The 
        ars <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">operon</ENAMEX> consists of a group of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes coding</ENAMEX> for a transmembrane pump and an arsenate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductase</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> ). The operon includes a
        regulatory gene ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsR</ENAMEX> ) and a gene coding for an
        arsenite-specific pump ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsB</ENAMEX> ) as well as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arsenite</ENAMEX> is pumped
        directly out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> by the 
        arsB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>; however arsenate must
        first be reduced to arsenite by the cytoplasmic arsenate
        reductase coded from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> also possess
        other 
        ars <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>: 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsA</ENAMEX> produces an arsenite-stimulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] that results in more efficient arsenite
        extrusion; 
        arsD encodes for a regulatory protein
        that controls the upper level of 
        ars expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsH</ENAMEX> has been identified but has an
        uncertain function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The 
        ars operon was initially recognized
        in plamids of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> xylosus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] but has
        subsequently been found in other microorganisms (e.g. 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , 
        Acidiphilum multivorum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , 
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ). The
        genes can be plasmid-borne or chromosomal, and
        genome-sequencing projects have identified putative 
        ars <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and
        Archaea that have not been specifically characterized in
        terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. An analogous genetic system ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arr</ENAMEX> or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACR</ENAMEX> ) has also been described in the
        eukaryote 
        Saccharomyces cervisiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Thus
        the 
        ars operon, or similar arsenic
        resistance systems, appears to be relatively widespread
        throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">microorganisms</TIMEX>.
        The 
        arsC gene is of particular interest
        in that its product, the soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme</ENAMEX> arsenate reductase,
        catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite. Arsenate
        is the thermodynamically favorable form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> under
        aerobic conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] , so it is likely to be the
        most common form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> in many environments. Thus, the
        presence and expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> is likely to be required for
        microorganisms inhabiting such areas. Furthermore, arsenite
        is generally more labile and toxic than arsenate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] ,
        so that expression of 
        arsC , and the ensuing reduction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsenate</ENAMEX> to arsenite, might increase the toxicity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> in the environment. Despite the potential
        importance of the 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> at both a physiological and
        environmental level, a thorough study of the phylogenetic
        distribution of different 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has not been
        performed.
        A simple phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> showing the relationships
        between the arsenate reductases of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacteria</ENAMEX> (those
        that had been confirmed to possess the gene at that time)
        was presented as part of a study that identified the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic resistance genes</ENAMEX> of 
        Thiobacillus ferrooxidans (now 
        Acidithiobacillus ferroxidans ) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltikov</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] used probes/primers based on
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli ars</ENAMEX> operon to detect 
        ars <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in natural environments,
        and presented a phylogenetic analysis of these genes,
        however their analysis was largely confined to enteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (those that were similar enough to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> to be detected) and they
        emphasized the 
        arsB gene rather than 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> . As part of a review of
        microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic transformations</ENAMEX>, we recently determined a
        preliminary 
        arsC phylogeny based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> sequences
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies reported phylogenies that
        suggested a common origin for the 
        ars genes examined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29</NUMEX> ] . An
        alternative view suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mukhopadhyay et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] is
        that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct classes of arsenate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">reductases</ENAMEX> exist,
        which have developed similar mechanisms and reaction
        centers through convergent evolution. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these classes
        are bacterial (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> typified by the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> found in enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> such
        as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> ; the other typified by the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus plasmids</ENAMEX> and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gram-positive Bacteria</ENAMEX>); the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> is the 
        Arr2 gene of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae . Phylogenies of these
        gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> 
        arsC sequences were recently reported
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . However, as well as microorganisms that have been
        shown to have demonstrable arsenate resistance, whole
        genome analyses of various microorganisms have revealed an
        increasing number of open reading frames (ORFs) that have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> . Inclusion of these putative 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in phylogenetic analyses
        might resolve the basic question: Did arsenate resistance
        systems evolve from a common origin or develop convergently
        in multiple taxa? In this study we attempt to answer this
        question through a phylogenetic analysis of both confirmed 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and those inferred from
        whole genome analyses. We compare this phylogeny to one
        derived from 16S <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rRNA</ENAMEX>, and suggest possible implications
        for the evolutionary history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microorganisms</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA based phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>)
        generally matched the accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rRNA model</ENAMEX> with clear
        separation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> prokaryotic domains and the
        subsequent divergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eukarya</ENAMEX> (represented by 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Minor inconsistencies such as 
        Ralstonia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solanacearum (β-Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>) forming a deep branch
        within the γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>, or 
        Fusobacterium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleatum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fusobacteria</ENAMEX>) and 
        Leptospira interrogans (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirochetes</ENAMEX>)
        grouping loosely with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> are likely
        the result of the limited data set used (they were the only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of their respective phyla that had listed 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and do not challenge
        established relationships. Otherwise the major divisions
        and subdivisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> (e.g. the various
        Proteobacteria, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low GC Gram-</ENAMEX>positives, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinobacteria</ENAMEX>)
        formed expected patterns. An interesting finding was the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouping</ENAMEX> (albeit weak) of 
        Nostoc muscorum and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechosystis sp</ENAMEX>. with 
        Deinococcus radiodurans to form a
        high level clade (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This is similar to findings
        from genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that suggest a close relationship between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deinococcales</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , although our
        16S <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rRNA</TIMEX> tree does not suggest a relationship between these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinobacteria</ENAMEX>. However, the Actinobacteria
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High GC Gram-positives</ENAMEX>) did clearly separate from the Low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        The 
        arsC phylogenies obtained by
        evolutionary distance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) analysis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and maximum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parsimony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) showed a number of broad
        similarities to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. There was clear
        separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> (with the sole
        eukaryote, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , grouping towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>), and also general grouping of the different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacterial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>; all the archaeal 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX> so it was not possible to examine division
        level phylogeny for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. Both treeing methods support
        the existence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> major classes of 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, corresponding to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea/Eukarya</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriales</ENAMEX> (enteric
        γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>) and α-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>, and the Low GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacteria</ENAMEX>. At a basic level, these broad
        groupings of 
        arsC correspond to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct
        classes of arsenate reductases that others have observed [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] , and these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had low sequence similarity
        to each other (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 33%</NUMEX> similarity between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea/Eukarya</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> similarity between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>). However, the analysis
        reported here includes more diverse 
        arsC sequences and suggests that
        other deeply branching types of 
        arsC exist. For example, the 
        arsC sequences from major divisions
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Green Sulfur Bacteria</ENAMEX> (represented
        by 
        Chlorobium tepidum ) and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deinococcales</ENAMEX> (represented by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans ) are loosely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with either the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Enterobacteriales/α-Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) or Low GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) depending upon the
        analysis used, but in either case diverge to form their own
        deep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, suggesting that they possess distinct
        arsenate reductases. Thus, the suggestion that the three
        previously reported classes of arsenate reductases
        developed through convergent evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] seems flawed:
        not only does 
        arsC phylogeny show broad parallels
        to the accepted <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA phylogeny, but deep bacterial
        divisions appear to possess the distinct arsenate
        reductases that would be expected from divergence from a
        common origin. Given the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate hypotheses</ENAMEX> of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX> followed by sequence divergence, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent</ENAMEX>
        origin of multiple 
        arsC sequence types with broadly
        similar reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and general mechanisms, based on
        the phylogenies observed and the general rarity of
        convergent evolution at a sequence level [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] we
        suggest that the former is more likely.
        A number of taxa do show 
        arsC phylogenies that are
        inconsistent with the established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rRNA evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, perhaps the most dramatic being the separation of
        some of the non-enteric γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
        Pseudomonas putida , 
        P. aeruginosa , and 
        A. ferrooxidans ) from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriales</ENAMEX>. The non-enteric γ-Proteobacteria
        actually appear to be paraphyletic with regards to 
        arsC , in that the two 
        Xanthomonas species <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the
        α-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>, whereas the others form a distinct group
        with the sole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the β-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> solanacearum ). The phylogenetic
        affiliation of the latter clade is uncertain: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> analysis
        placed it as a deep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low GC Gram</ENAMEX> positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> placed it loosely
        with the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriales/α-Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> group
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Either placement had poor bootstrap support,
        and given the relatively low sequence homology of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX> to either of the other major bacterial 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> similarity to the
        Low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC Gram positives</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> similarity to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriales/α-Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) we suspect that
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> might represent a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        arsenate reductases, making its placement in a binary tree
        difficult. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> distinct difference between the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16s</ENAMEX> rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> is the tight
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grouping of the Cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> with the 
        arsC sequences from Low GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacteria</ENAMEX>. Other discrepancies are placement
        of the three 
        Streptococcus sequences (Low GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Gram-positive Bacteria</ENAMEX>) with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinobacteria</ENAMEX> and the
        placement of 
        Aquifex aeolicus (basal in the 16S
        rRNA-defined bacterial clade) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX> nucleatum within the Low GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram-positives</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>). The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequence
        types were the only 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> reported for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquificales</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fusobacteria</ENAMEX>, respectively, and as with
        some of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16S</NUMEX> rRNA tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, might represent the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> data set rather than true evolutionary
        relationships. However, 
        A. aeolicus is known to have
        exchanged numerous genes with other microorganisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] ,
        and the phylogeny of its arsenate reductase gene might
        represent another example of this.
        Regardless of the particular phylogenetic methods used,
        the 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> clearly show a number of
        non-orthologous 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, assuming that the 16S
        rRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> reflects true phylogeny. One explanation for
        these inconsistencies could be the existence of 
        arsC paralogs that have diverged
        after 
        arsC gene duplication events. While
        this might be the case for those organisms with 
        arsC sequences that were not closely
        related to other sequences (e.g. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> tepidum ), it is an unreasonable
        explanation for the similar 
        arsC sequences (e.g. those of the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyanobacteria</ENAMEX>) that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> within unexpected larger clades.
        Rather than multiple gene duplication events or convergent
        evolution, this suggests horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Recent studies suggest
        that HGT events may have been much more widespread during
        prokaryotic evolution than had been previously thought,
        with genetic exchange even occurring between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36 37</NUMEX> ] . While we see no evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-domain transfer of 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> events
        could explain some of the discrepancies between 16S
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rRNA</ENAMEX>-based and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">arsC</ENAMEX> -based phylogenies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> of 
        arsC from an ancestral low GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> to an ancestral cyanobacterium
        seems likely, and a similar HGT event from ancestral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinobacteria</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptococci</ENAMEX> would explain the
        unexpected phylogeny of the 
        Streptococcus arsC sequences. Similar
        gene transfer events from the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX>-positives to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX> nucleatum could also have
        occurred, but with an 
        arsC sequence only available from a
        single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fusobacteria</ENAMEX> it is difficult to draw
        conclusions. The paraphyletic 
        arsC sequences in the non-enteric
        γ-Proteobacteria likewise may have arisen from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> events,
        although the difficulty in resolving the affiliation of
        some of these sequences makes speculation about their
        evolution premature. Indeed, the exact placement of many of
        the non-orthologous 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was difficult and poor
        bootstrap support for some nodes suggests that refinement
        of 
        arsC phylogeny as more sequences
        become available should be an ongoing process. Regardless,
        a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> possess 
        arsC genes that are inconsistent with
        established phylogenies, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> events are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible
        explanation. It should also be noted that some of the
        non-orthologous sequences represent putative 
        arsC genes identified from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>'s,
        rather than confirmed arsenate reductases. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>'s show
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to identified 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, but may not necessarily
        code for a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX>. Thus, some of the
        non-orthologous sequences might represent elevated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypic</ENAMEX> variation if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> has no selective
        pressure to maintain a functional 
        arsC gene.
        We were hoping that patterns in the phylogeny of
        plasmid-borne 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> might indicate whether HGT
        of 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has occurred (or is still
        occurring) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</TIMEX>. Specifically, if the
        plasmid-borne arsenate reductases are similar, this would
        suggest a common origin for these genes, which must
        ultimately be chromosomal. However, the plasmid-borne 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> appear to be paraphyletic
        and clearly separate into very different 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of plasmid-borne genes are those of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staphylococci</ENAMEX> (which were the first 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to be recognized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ]
        ) and those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriales</ENAMEX>. Both of these groups
        of plasmid-borne genes are similar to the chromosomal genes
        found in related <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The only exception is the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arsC</ENAMEX> found on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pKW301</TIMEX> plasmid of 
        A. multivorum , which shows high
        sequence similarity to the plasmid-borne 
        arsC sequences found in the
        Enterobacteriales, strongly suggesting relatively recent
        plasmid transfer between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and 
        A. multivorum . Indeed, the 
        ars operon found in 
        A. multivorum is expressed and
        confers arsenate resistance when transferred to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> other types of
        plasmid-borne 
        arsC genes are found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> solanacearum , 
        Clostridium acetobutylicum , and 
        Halobacterium halobium ,
        demonstrating that plasmid-borne 
        arsC genes are phylogenetically
        widespread and suggesting multiple incidences of
        chromosomal-plasmid transfer. The 
        arsC sequence of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> acetobutylicum is typical of the
        clostridial 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and also shows some
        similarity to the arsenate reductase sequence in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. interrogans</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirochete</ENAMEX>). Thus,
        it is possible that ancestral clostridial plasmids may have
        transferred 
        ars <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirochetes</ENAMEX>. As well
        as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> acetobutylicum , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were represented by both chromosomal and
        plasmid-borne 
        arsC sequences. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli K12</ENAMEX> are similar, but they are
        equally similar to the plasmid-borne genes of other enteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The plasmid-borne 
        arsC gene from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella typhimurium</ENAMEX> , shows little
        similarity to it's chromosomal equivalent, and appears to
        be related to the other 
        arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> found in plasmids in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterobacteriales</ENAMEX>. The high similarity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 70%</NUMEX>)
        between all the enteric plasmids suggests a common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>,
        which from this analysis appears to be very similar to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> chromosomal 
        arsC gene. However, it is clear that
        within the enterics, relationships based on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arsC</ENAMEX> do not parallel relationships
        based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16S</TIMEX> rRNA, and significant genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> within
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (possibly inside a host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>) has likely
        occurred.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Despite the suggestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> and duplication events,
        the 
        arsC phylogeny suggests that arsenate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductase</ENAMEX> is an evolutionarily old enzyme, a hypothesis
        that was recently suggested for arsenite oxidase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
        This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phylogenetic analysis of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> redox
        active gene to include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> domains and the Archaea
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> were clearly separated, with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> subsequently branching
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archaea</ENAMEX>. Thus, the 
        arsC gene, and by extension, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX>
        resistance mechanisms, must have been present in early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, either in the last universal ancestor or after
        the divergence of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> prokaryotic domains (i.e. in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ancestral bacterium</ENAMEX> or archaean). In the latter case, early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> event(s) must have transferred arsenate resistance to
        the other domain, followed by subsequent divergence to the
        phylogeny seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Such gene exchange between Archaea
        and primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> has certainly taken place [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and
        makes absolute statements about the initial origin of genes
        difficult to make. Regardless, it seems likely that
        arsenate resistance developed early in the evolution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microorganisms</ENAMEX>. Recent ideas on the origin of life suggest
        that early cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were abiotic iron-sulfur
        formations at submarine hydrothermal vents in the Hadean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ocean</ENAMEX>, in which basic biochemical and metabolic processes
        could have developed before the formation of cell membranes
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . As well as iron and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX>, hydrothermal areas
        are often are often characterized by high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] and may even contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> redox active microbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Given the integral role of phosphate
        in early (and current) cellular metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , an
        ability to reduce the levels of arsenate (a phosphate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX>) might have been an essential biochemical process.
        There would have been selective pressure to develop an
        arsenate reductase that could change this arsenate to
        arsenite, and this early evolution of an 
        arsC -like ancestor coupled with
        sequence divergence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> would result in the diversity
        and widespread distribution of 
        arsC genes seen in microorganisms
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Sequence acquisition and alignment
          Sequences of 
          arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were obtained from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] and were characterized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broad
          types: confirmed 
          arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (i.e. those sequences
          that were identified in studies that explicitly tested
          arsenate reduction and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in that given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organism</ENAMEX>), and putative 
          arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (i.e. open reading
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frames</ENAMEX> (ORFs) obtained from genome projects that showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to known 
          arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). Genes were also noted
          as being either chromosomal or plasmid-borne. A total of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 sequences</TIMEX> were analyzed consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> bacterial, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          archaeal, and the 
          Arr2 gene of

          numbers for these sequences are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> [see
          Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. The 
          Arr2 gene (or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ACR2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] ) has
          been identified as coding for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> necessary for
          arsenate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, and appears to have some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to prokaryotic

          Distance and maximum parsimony (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>) methods were used to
          construct 
          arsC <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> using aligned nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. Both methods used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 60</NUMEX> aligned 
          arsC nucleotide sequences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tree</ENAMEX> was constructed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ARB</ENAMEX> using neighbor joining
          following a simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olsen</ENAMEX>
          correction. Because visual examination of the aligned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequences</ENAMEX> revealed a number of gaps suggesting
          insertion/deletion events within different taxa, gaps
          were treated as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> base for construction. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
          phylogeny was based on a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">408</NUMEX> informative
          positions with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> bootstraps performed as part of the
          procedure. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP phylogeny</ENAMEX> used the same informative
          positions and number of bootstraps, and was performed
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> package included with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' contributions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRJ</ENAMEX> carried out the phylogenetic analyses, participated
        in sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript. SLD
        obtained the sequence information and participated in
        sequence alignment. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> read and approved the
        final manuscript.
