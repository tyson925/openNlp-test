        Infection with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis C virus</ENAMEX> (HCV) occurs
        primarily through percutaneous exposure to contaminated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood products</ENAMEX>. Unlike most other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">viral hepatitis</ENAMEX>
        infections that tend to be acute, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> C infections
        are often chronic and persist for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . The
        long-term sequelae of chronic HCV infections include
        increased risks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver cirrhosis</ENAMEX> and hepatocellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infection is a major public health problem in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Blood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and community-based surveys
        conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> have reported sero-prevalence rates of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as 40%</NUMEX> in some parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] . These rates are substantially higher in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Delta</ENAMEX> region compared with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> is a parasitic infection transmitted
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> from snails that harbor the parasite. Most rural
        and peri-urban areas located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Delta</ENAMEX> are in close
        proximity to the distributaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile River</ENAMEX> or
        irrigation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> drawn from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX>. These slow flowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are infested with snails that serve as the vector
        for the schistosomal parasite. Schistosomiasis infections,
        in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> are hyperendemic in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nile Delta</ENAMEX>
        region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1970s</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX>, mass campaigns were
        conducted to treat schistosomiasis infections in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, during which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> older than 5 years of age
        were treated with tartar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emetic</ENAMEX> injections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Sero-surveys conducted in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>'s in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> have reported
        positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections and a history
        of schistosomiasis or a history of having received
        injections for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 12 13</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . Based on this evidence, the studies suggest that
        inadequately sterilized needles and syringes used during
        the campaign were probable causes for transmission of HCV
        in the region.
        Since all the studies were conducted as cross-sectional
        surveys, it is not possible to know whether the HCV
        infections were pre-existing at the time of the treatment
        campaigns or whether they were incident infections as a
        consequence of the campaigns. The studies have also
        reported low prevalence rates in the younger age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
        high prevalence rates for the older ages suggesting that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> infected between the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>'s to the early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>'s
        are now older and more likely to be sero-positive compared
        to those born after the campaigns. A limitation of most of
        the published studies is the implicit assumption in their
        analyses that all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the survey are
        independent of each other and that infection rates are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniformly</ENAMEX> distributed both within and across all households
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. If the suggested nosocomial mechanism of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> were true, the assumption that infection rates
        are uniformly distributed would not be valid, because HCV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> will tend to cluster within households that
        participated in the campaign compared to households that
        did not. The uniform distribution assumption is further
        complicated by the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-groups</ENAMEX> of high risk and
        low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> based on their date
        of birth. If a household participated in the campaign and
        has an infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, there is a greater likelihood that
        another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> who resided in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at the time of
        the campaign will be infected, but a low likelihood that an
        individual born within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> after the campaign
        period will be infected.
        We postulate that an entire household was more likely to
        have participated in the campaign if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> had a history of schistosomiasis and received
        treatment by injections, compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in which no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> reported a past history and parenteral treatment for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX>. Based on this premise, we would expect
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HCV</ENAMEX> infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in which one or
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> reported having received parenteral treatment
        for schistosomiasis, if the underlying reason for the
        spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HCV</ENAMEX> infection was in fact attributable to the
        treatment campaign.
        Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HCV</ENAMEX> infection status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        participating in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> based sero-survey conducted in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> delta of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, we tested the following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotheses</ENAMEX> to assess if the schistosomiasis treatment
        campaigns were associated with transmission of HCV:
        i) Participation by village <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> treatment campaigns were likely to cluster
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> more likely to
        participate in the campaign if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> member
        participated.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ii) Clustering</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> is more
        likely among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that participated in the treatment
        campaigns compared to those that did not.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Site
          The study was conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kalama</ENAMEX>, a semi-urban area
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qalyub</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District of the Qualyabia Governorate</ENAMEX>. The
          village is located on the south-east edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX>
          River delta, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 19 km</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heliopolis</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. Irrigated farmlands and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> surround the
          village, a feature typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> delta. The village
          has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> living
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX> is the primary
          occupation. Residents live in small single story homes
          either as single nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> or extended families
          with multiple related nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> residing within
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. The median household size was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
          at the time of the study.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Population</ENAMEX> and sero-survey
          Details of the study have been described elsewhere [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . Briefly, after conducting a census in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> was divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> geographic sectors.
          Every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> thhouse was then systematically sampled for
          participation in a sero-survey. Of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">172</NUMEX> sampled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household heads</ENAMEX> agreed to participate.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between January and June 1995</TIMEX>, after obtaining written
          informed consent, we conducted a sero-survey and
          administered a questionnaire to the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>,
          soliciting medical and behavioral risk factors for liver
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. History of schistosomiasis was obtained by
          interview in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were asked whether they
          had ever received a diagnosis of schistosomiasis.
          Regardless of their histories, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were
          further queried about past treatment for schistosomiasis
          and whether the treatment was with oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, injections
          or both. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was then obtained
          via a venipuncture from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> under
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years of age</TIMEX> were excluded from the sero-survey
          because earlier work in Kalama demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HCV</ENAMEX> infection
          to be rare in this age group [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Baseline
          socio-demographic information was collected at the time
          of the census. Household socio-economic status was
          classified as high, medium or low according to a locally
          developed scale. Details of the laboratory methods used
          to detect anti-HCV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> have been described
          elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, serum from the blood samples
          was screened for anti-HCV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbot</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX>). All EIA-reactive sera were evaluated with
          either the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> generation recombinant
          immunoblot assays (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron Corporation</ENAMEX>) as confirmatory
          tests. Positive results by either of the immunoblot
          assays were considered to be HCV positive (positive for
          anti-HCV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Statistical methods
          For baseline comparisons of the HCV positive and
          negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, we used the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exact</ENAMEX> test when there was sparse data) for
          categorical variables. For dimensional variables, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test was used to compare the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> when the data
          was normally distributed, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mann-Whitney-U</ENAMEX> test,
          when assumptions of normality were not met.
          To test for intra- and inter-class clustering of HCV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, we used a modified formulation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Generalized Estimating Equations</ENAMEX> (GEE). The original
          formulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEE</ENAMEX> also referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GEE1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] is
          used in the analysis of correlated data in which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> is treated as a nuisance factor that needs to
          be taken into account at the analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>. This
          approach uses a working correlation matrix to model the
          correlation between the repeated or related observations
          for an individual or a cluster while simultaneously
          adjusting for covariates in a generalized linear model.
          With the new formulation, also referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GEE2</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alternating Logistic Regression</ENAMEX> (ALR), clustering can be
          treated as a parameter of interest on which we can
          perform hypothesis testing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Instead of
          specifying a correlation matrix, an OR is computed for
          each cluster in this approach to detect clustering among
          related observations. Since the outcome of our study is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binary</ENAMEX> (HCV positive or negative), we describe the
          approach for binary outcomes.
          For a family of size n, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HCV</ENAMEX> status (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> = negative, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> =
          positive) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">j thindividual</ENAMEX>, we define
          log [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pr</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> )/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pr</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> )] = β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> + β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 x</ENAMEX> 
          1j + β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 x</ENAMEX> 
          2j <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ ......</ENAMEX> + + β 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> x 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mj</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x</ENAMEX>'s are m covariates for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">j thindividual</ENAMEX>.
          For most analyses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x</ENAMEX>'s are variables that describe
          the baseline characteristics or are confounding
          variables. These variables could be specific to the j
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thindividual</ENAMEX> (such as age and gender) or could be common
          for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (e.g. race or socio-economic status
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>). The β's are the regression parameters to
          be estimated. We next define the odds ratio (OR) between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">j thand k thmembers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as
          
          The odds ratio is a commonly used measure of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> for categorical variables and assumes the
          values between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and infinity. An odds ratio equal to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> suggests the lack of an association between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. In equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>), an OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for each of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> C 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (number of ways in which we can
          select <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> within a house
          indicates the absence of clustering of disease within the
          family. On the other hand, an odds ratio greater than one
          will indicate clustering of disease within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          It should be noted that the OR defined in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) is not the
          same OR that one conventionally uses to measure the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between exposure and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in case-control
          or observational studies. The OR in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) describes the
          odds of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> for another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> in the
          same cluster, given that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> is affected or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unaffected</ENAMEX>. We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">henceforth</ENAMEX> refer to this OR <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as 'OR</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering'</ENAMEX>. Such ORs are commonly used to describe
          familial aggregation of disease in genetic studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
          . The OR can be modeled for subclasses or sub-clusters
          within the main cluster as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">log OR</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jk</ENAMEX> = γ 
          z (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
          Where z indicates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class membership</ENAMEX> of the (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX>, k)
          pair within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. For example, if we consider adults
          within a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of class 'a' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to
          be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of class 'c', then log(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jk</ENAMEX> ) = γ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aa</ENAMEX> , γ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cc</ENAMEX> , or γ 
          ac depending on whether the (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX>, k)
          pair are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, or an adult-child <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. From
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) we thus obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two intra</NUMEX>-class ORs namely e
          γaaand e γccfor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> respectively and one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-class OR namely e γacbetween <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. A
          significant γ 
          aa or γ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cc</ENAMEX> is suggestive of clustering within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> or within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, whereas a significant γ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX> is indicative of the existence of a
          correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. When z = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          there is a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and the equation models a
          constant log odds across all the clusters. Estimates for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">β's</ENAMEX> and γ's are obtained by simultaneous estimation of
          the parameters from equations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>), thereby
          adjusting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORs</ENAMEX> for covariates introduced in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>).
          Further details on the formulation, estimation methods,
          features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, and properties of the estimators
          have been published elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] .
          To model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-groups</ENAMEX> of high and low risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> within
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, we chose an age cutoff of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX> based on an
          examination of the age-specific prevalence within our
          study and based on reports stating that parenteral
          treatment of schistosomiasis was stopped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982</TIMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, with the introduction of praziquintal, an oral drug
          used to treat the disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
          under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years of age</TIMEX> were not eligible for receiving
          injections during the campaigns. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> would have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 years of age</TIMEX> at the time of our
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> HCV study, it can be safely assumed that they were
          not present at the time of the schistosomiasis campaigns.
          This age cutoff has also been used in other studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          ] .
          We conducted our analysis using the ALR implementation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V8.02</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). Since
          we assume that the parenteral treatment for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> in the campaigns for the entire house
          occurred around the same time, to model the correlation
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, ordering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> (cluster) is not relevant. Hence, to
          model the OR for clustering of schistosmiasis treatment
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, an exchangeable log odds ratio was assumed.
          With an exchangeable log odds ratio, a constant OR for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> is assumed for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. To estimate the
          degree of clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections, a history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenteral</ENAMEX> treatment of schistosomiasis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was
          considered to be a blocking factor. Separate log odds
          ratios were estimated for each block with the assumption
          that the log odds ratios are constant within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        The study sample contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">910</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        residing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">810</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX>) agreed to
        participate in the study and provided <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX>. The
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> within these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with a median (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inter-quartile</NUMEX> range) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 -</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Anti-HCV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were evaluated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">796</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> collected. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">321</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were sero-reactive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> positive
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> were significantly older than those who were
        negative (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>). Other variables measured at
        baseline were comparable for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Although not
        statistically significant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> seropositive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        were more frequently males and of low socio-economic status
        (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Age specific HCV positive prevalence rates
        increase around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years of age</TIMEX> suggesting the possibility
        of a cohort effect (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The sero-prevalence of
        anti-HCV <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6% - 16%</NUMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years of age</TIMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>CI: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43% - 51%</NUMEX>)
        for those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years or older</TIMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>).
        Fifty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> reported receiving injections for the
        treatment of schistosomiasis. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Houses</ENAMEX> in which an adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> reported receiving parenteral treatment were more
        likely to have other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult members</ENAMEX> with histories of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenteral</ENAMEX> treatment for schistosomiasis. The OR for
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> receiving parenteral treatment
        was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.44</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.47</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.06</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), suggesting
        that past participation in the treatment campaigns tended
        to cluster within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>.
        Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">746</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who reported no history of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> or no parenteral treatment for diagnosed
        schistosomiasis, the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX> compared to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who reported receiving the
        treatment (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .0001</NUMEX>). Examination of the degree of
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that
        received parenteral treatment indicated that there was a
        significant degree of clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections in such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>. After adjusting for individual level effects of age
        and gender, and household characteristics such as
        socio-economic status and risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> based on eligibility
        for participation in the schistosomiasis treatment
        campaigns, all of which were significant confounding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, the OR for clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.76</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.05</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.95</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .05</NUMEX>) (table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In contrast,
        the OR for clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in
        which no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> reported a history of parenteral treatment
        for a past schistosomiasis infection was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.37</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX>
        - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.05</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>). If we inappropriately used logistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> and treated all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to be independent
        of each other, the odds of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HCV</ENAMEX> infection among members
        reporting previous parenteral schistosomiasis treatment
        compared to those who did not, after adjusting for the same
        confounding variables, was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.55</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.98</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.19</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        Our analysis reveals that there is significant amount of
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of the study
        village and that the infections are not distributed
        uniformly across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. We also demonstrate that some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> were more likely to have participated in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> treatment campaigns compared to others and
        that the clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections were more likely
        among the households that participated in the treatment
        campaigns. In the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, based on the time
        period during which the treatment campaigns were conducted
        and the ensuing age distribution of the HCV infections
        obtained from multiple cross-sectional surveys, a temporal
        and possible causal relationship between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> events
        has been suggested [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Our study adds to this finding
        by studying these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> events within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
        thus providing further evidence that the spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Delta</ENAMEX> region was associated with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> treatment campaign.
        The observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> were more likely to have
        participated in the treatment campaign if any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> participated in the campaign is corroborated by
        the manner in which the treatment campaigns were conducted.
        Unlike mass campaigns conducted for vaccinations, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>-to-house visits are made and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are immunized,
        the treatment campaigns were conducted at centralized
        health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>. In
        some instances, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> were rolling clinics
        established temporarily at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. This situation
        makes it likely that entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> rather than random
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> would have visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> based on factors
        such as proximity, risk of schistosomiasis infection to the
        household, and socio-economic status. Indeed, our analysis
        finds that socio-economic status of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was strongly
        predictive of whether an individual tests positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX>,
        after adjusting for the effects of clustering.
        Potential limitations of this study need to be
        mentioned. Since reports of receiving injections for
        treatment of schistosomiasis were by recall, it is possible
        that inaccuracies in the recall might have biased the
        results of the study. Additionally, it is possible that a
        report by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the family potentially influences
        the response of another family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> during the interview
        process. Such related responses will artificially tend to
        show clustering of participation in the treatment campaigns
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. However, since testing of sera for HCV
        antibodies for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was done without
        knowledge of which sera belonged to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and since
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections was observed within families
        independent of the participation in the treatment
        campaigns, it is unlikely that the clustering of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' participation in the treatment campaigns were
        solely due to biased reporting since there is an 
        a priori reason to believe that such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> is possible on the basis of the manner in which
        the campaigns were conducted. It could be stated that
        familial clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections may be due to other
        factors or behaviors that are related to an increased risk
        of schistosomiasis as well as an increased risk of HCV
        infections. Alternatively, certain household behaviors such
        as health care practices or tendency to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> who
        use unsafe treatment methods, could also result in
        clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. If this
        were true and was the sole explanation for the clustering
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infections within the household, we would expect to
        see HCV infections in the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> too who were not
        present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> at the time of the treatment
        campaigns within such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. However, our previous work
        in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> found HCV infections among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> less
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years of age</TIMEX> to be extremely rare, thus making it
        less likely that unmeasured factors might be influencing
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        Despite the use of oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for the treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two decades</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> antibodies
        were detected in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years of age</TIMEX>.
        Vertical transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> from infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to infant
        occurs in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCV</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and is
        reported to increase with increasing viral loads [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Prospective studies could help determine the relative
        contribution of vertical and horizontal transmission of HCV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX> observed in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        Most previous studies that have that have found
        associations between histories of schistosomiasis and HCV
        have either been designed as surveys or have used ecologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>. While ecologic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> are very useful
        for generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hypotheses</ENAMEX>, one should be cautious in trying
        to make individual level inferences from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> based
        observations because of the multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of biases
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with such study designs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . After using the
        appropriate analytic methods, our results provide further
        evidence for an association between the parenteral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schistosomiasis</ENAMEX> treatment campaigns and the transmission of
        HCV infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
