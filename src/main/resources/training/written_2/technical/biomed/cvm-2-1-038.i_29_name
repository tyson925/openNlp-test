        The disappointingly slow progress in developing
        effective therapies for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> has led to a
        re-evaluation of the strategies for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> drug development
        and the methods used in clinical trials. Magnetic resonance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imaging</ENAMEX> (MRI) techniques have been proposed and have begun
        to be used in stroke trials as a means of optimizing
        patient selection and as a direct measure of the effect of
        treatments on the brain.
        One objective in all clinical trials is the selection of
        a sample that is sufficiently homogeneous to reduce the
        statistical variance of the data and thereby optimize the
        sensitivity of the design to detecting a therapeutic
        response, while remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the population
        of interest. Ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> trials have traditionally
        sought to limit the range of disease studied according to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of several dimensions, such as clinical
        severity at the time of enrollment, exclusion of
        non-ischemic causes for the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, lesion
        location and vascular territory, stroke mechanism, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-morbidities. These dimensions have been assessed in the
        modern era of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> clinical trials by clinical criteria
        at the bedside, usually aided by the exclusion of cerebral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemorrhage</ENAMEX> or other non-ischemic pathology by non-contrast
        computed tomography (CT) scan as the only imaging tool
        required. Except for the trials of intravenous recombinant
        tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) in the treatment of
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 3</TIMEX> h [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], this traditional
        approach has lead to no approved therapies for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, and
        has lead to a great degree of pessimism with regard to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombolysis</ENAMEX> beyond 3 h and with regard to the concept of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroprotection</ENAMEX> in stroke.
        Because several imaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">modalities</ENAMEX> may provide more
        accurate and specific information than a clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> and a normal CT scan, it has been proposed that
        positive imaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">diagnoses</ENAMEX> would improve patient selection
        toward the goal of a more optimal target sample for stroke
        clinical trials, a sample selected based on an imaging
        diagnosis of a pathology that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is hypothesized to
        treat; for example, an arterial occlusion or perfusion
        defect for thrombolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. This principle has been
        supported by the results of the intra-arterial
        pro-urokinase <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROACT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Prior attempts
        to prove the efficacy of thrombolysis initiated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 3</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 h</NUMEX> from onset without a positive diagnosis of arterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occlusion</ENAMEX> or perfusion defect have not been successful [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROACT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], however, were selected
        based on evidence of arterial occlusions at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the M1</TIMEX> or M2
        levels of the middle cerebral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> by conventional
        arteriography, and a significant clinical benefit was
        observed when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thromboly-sis</ENAMEX> was initiated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 6 h</NUMEX> from
        symptom onset (median time to treat, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX> h). Whereas trials
        of intravenous (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) thrombolysis between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 6</NUMEX> h in a
        general sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were not
        positive, selection of the optimal subgroup by imaging
        diagnosis of the appropriate arterial lesion was an
        effective strategy in this time period for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROACT</ENAMEX> II. This
        study contradicted the increasingly promoted hypothesis
        that treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">thrombol-ysis</ENAMEX> (or any therapy)
        beyond 3 h would not be successful. Selection of the
        optimal target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> by angiography led to slower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX> and a more expensive trial, but to a successful
        result. The results of that trial suggested that a more
        prolonged study duration, increased expense and potential
        delay in treatment to complete a screening test may be
        justified by the greater chance of demonstrating
        therapeutic success using a more homogeneous and rational
        selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The appeal of MRI methods is that, whereas the standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CT</ENAMEX> examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> will typically
        appear normal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the first hours</TIMEX> after stroke onset, the
        methods of magnetic resonance angiography, perfusion
        weighted imaging (PWI), and diffusion weighted imaging
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX>) provide information on arterial patency, tissue blood
        flow, and parenchymal injury from the earliest times after
        onset of ischemic symptoms in a brief, non-invasive
        examination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DWI (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) detects tissue injury within
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of ischemia, has high sensitivity and specificity
        for the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>, and permits
        measurement of lesion volumes that correlate with clinical
        severity and prognosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. If
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">untreated</ENAMEX>, the lesion seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX> typically enlarges over
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and will progress to infarction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PWI</ENAMEX> depicts
        focal cerebral ischemia. The volume of ischemic tissue seen
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWI</ENAMEX>, in the majority of cases, is greater than the
        region of parenchymal injury evident on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX>, and this
        diffusion-perfusion mismatch is considered to be a marker
        of the ischemic penumbra (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), the tissue at greatest
        risk for infarct progression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, increasing theoretical, experimental,
        and clinical evidence suggests that MRI using magnetic
        susceptibility weighted pulse sequences may be sensitive to
        the early detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hemorrhage</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24</TIMEX>]. Although
        prospective comparisons of MRI and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> for sensitivity to
        hemorrhage detection have yet to be reported, the proper
        acquisition and interpretation of MRI can eliminate the
        need for a screening CT scan and regain some of the time
        spent on adding a MRI examination to a screening
        evaluation. The target pathology revealed by MRI also
        represents the biological marker of the disease that can
        serve as a surrogate measure for assessing the effects of a
        therapy.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> potential uses of MRI in clinical trials have been
        proposed: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> selection, proof of pharmacologic
        principle, and as an outcome measure.
        In using MRI as a selection criterion in patient
        selection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the goal would be a sample based on a
        positive imaging diagnosis of a pathology rationally linked
        to the drug's mechanisms of action. Requiring a positive
        diagnosis of acute ischemic injury by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX> would ideally
        assure that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diagnoses mimicking stroke</ENAMEX> are
        included in the sample, a desirable objective unachievable
        in trials using bedside impression and normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> as the
        basis of inclusion. The goal of image-based patient
        selection is to narrow the range of patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, leading to a more homogeneous sample,
        reducing within<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> variance, and increasing the
        statistical power of the experimental design to demonstrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX>. Optimal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> selection would be based on
        positive imaging evidence of the ischemic pathology that
        the therapy has been developed to treat. The simplest use
        as an inclusion criterion would include the presence of a
        lesion on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX> to increase the diagnostic certainty of
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. The optimal target of therapy for
        reperfusion therapies would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with evidence of an
        arterial occlusion or hypoper-fusion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 25</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Optimal</ENAMEX> selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for neuroprotective drugs
        would be acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> involving the cerebral cortex and
        with a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of hypoperfusion - the
        diffusion-perfusion mismatch indicative of tissue at risk
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">infarction</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> might also be
        excluded from the trial at screening if subacute or chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are found that may confound measurements of lesion
        volumes or clinical severity as outcome variables. Because
        of a relatively large error of measurement associated with
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> larger than a minimum volume
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">eg 5 cm 3</ENAMEX>) may be desirable. Furthermore, an upper limit
        of lesion volume at enrollment would permit an opportunity
        for lesion growth and may better differentiate the effect
        on lesion size of an effective treatment from placebo.
        Selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX> is also optimally suited for
        using the lesion volume change as a direct measure of the
        neuroprotective effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
        The proof of pharmacological principle uses MRI as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> of response to therapy, replicating the preclinical
        experiment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Before an experimental stroke
        therapy is brought from the laboratory to clinical trial,
        it is necessary to demonstrate that the treatment causes
        reduction in lesion volume in experimental models. The
        fundamental premise of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery and development in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute stroke</ENAMEX> is that treatments that reduce lesion size are
        those most likely to lead to clinical benefit. In clinical
        trial programs that depend solely on clinical endpoints as
        indices of benefit, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> may be brought to phase III
        testing - costing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of millions of</NUMEX>
        dollars - without the slightest evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> will
        have the therapeutic effect observed in the experimental
        model. Only a safe and acceptable dose must be demonstrated
        by the end of phase II. The question of whether the
        treatment causes reduction of lesion volume, however, may
        be answerable in the study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>,
        whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-10</NUMEX> times as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are typically tested in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phase III</ENAMEX> studies to evaluate the treatment with clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>. A phase II MRI endpoint trial to replicate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preclinical</ENAMEX> experiment in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> may thus be
        a rational and cost-effective basis of deciding whether to
        proceed with phase III testing. A positive lesion outcome
        study in late phase <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II</ENAMEX> would be supportive of the decision
        to proceed with phase III trials.
        MRI measurements have proven to be a marker of clinical
        severity measured by stroke scales [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 15, 27, 28</TIMEX>], and
        changes in lesion volume over time are associated with
        change in clinical severity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. The exact
        sample size that is required for detecting the effect of
        lesion volume change with MRI will depend on many factors
        in the design of a trial. The citicoline MRI trial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>],
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 40</NUMEX> evaluable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
        approached but did not reach significance. Estimates based
        on that study indicate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per treatment arm
        would have been sufficient to demonstrate a neuroprotective
        effect in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, a sample size compatible with typical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phase II</ENAMEX> sample sizes. That study and natural history
        samples suggest that a sample size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-100</NUMEX> should be
        sufficient to demonstrate a neuro-protective effect on
        lesion volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        It is proposed that a treatment emergent advantage on a
        measure of lesion volume is a surrogate of clinical benefit
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> trials (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The rationale for the use of
        lesion volume as a surrogate measure in stroke trials may
        be summarized as follows. Lesion volume reduction in animal
        models is both necessary and sufficient evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroprotection</ENAMEX>. The clinical benefit for neuroprotective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is mediated through a reduction in cell death and
        brain tissue loss. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> that reduce infarct volume are
        those most likely to cause clinical benefit.
        The factors required for validation of MRI as a
        surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker</ENAMEX> are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        of these requirements have been met (see earlier discussion
        and cited references). Confirmation of the validity of many
        of these features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWI</ENAMEX> in acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> has
        recently come from the first prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multicenter</ENAMEX> stroke
        trial using MRI as an inclusion and primary outcome
        measure, the citicoline MRI stroke trial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. In that
        study, identical MRI hardware and software were used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 h</NUMEX> of onset. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were
        randomly assigned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/day citicoline or placebo.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diffusion</ENAMEX> and perfusion MRI were obtained before treatment,
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 12 weeks</TIMEX> after treatment. Image data processing
        and volumetric analysis were performed at a single central
        laboratory using a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert reader</ENAMEX> blinded to patient
        clinical severity and treatment assignment. The primary MRI
        inclusion criterion was a lesion of volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120 cm</NUMEX> 3in
        middle cerebral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> territory gray matter. The primary
        efficacy endpoint was a change in lesion volume from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pretreatment</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 12</TIMEX>. Although the primary efficacy
        endpoint of an effect of citicoline on lesion growth was
        numerically different (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">181%</NUMEX> increase in lesion volume in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">placebo patients</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> increase for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citicoline</ENAMEX> treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>), it was not statistically significant. However,
        the study replicated the findings of other investigations
        regarding the relationship of MRI-derived lesion volumes to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' clinical status. Acute lesion volumes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWI</ENAMEX> in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> correlated significantly with acute clinical
        severity on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> stroke scale scores ( 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.64</NUMEX>) and with chronic lesion
        volume ( 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX>); the chronic lesion volume
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T2</NUMEX>-weighted MRI significantly correlated with chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> stroke scale score ( 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.63</NUMEX>). The strongest predictor of
        change in lesion size from baseline in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their week 12</TIMEX> assessment was the size of the
        perfusion abnormality ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX> by co-variance
        analysis). The volume change over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12 weeks</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> was significantly related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
        clinical improvement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> meeting the protocol
        specified criterion of clinical improvement (improvement on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> stroke scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> points or more) had a
        significantly more favorable response on the lesion volume
        change outcome variable than those who did not improve. The
        differentiation of improved from not improved was present
        whether the lesion volume change was assessed as an
        absolute decrease (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>), median change (-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> cm
        3versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX> cm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), or mean (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>) change (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.8</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>] cm
        3versus 25.5 [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.8</NUMEX>] cm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). This prospective
        multicenter, centrally analyzed trial confirmed the value
        of MRI as a marker of disease severity and progression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stroke</ENAMEX> trials, and indicated that the change in MRI lesion
        size is likely to predict clinical improvement in clinical
        trials.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> criterion of validation, the concordance of
        effects on clinical outcomes and surrogate outcomes,
        remains to be demonstrated. Effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> will show
        benefit on both clinical and imaging outcome measures. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citicoline</ENAMEX> trials provide support for this, wherein trends
        on both clinical and imaging outcomes measures have been
        observed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ineffective drugs</ENAMEX> will show
        benefit on neither clinical nor imaging outcome measures.
        The latter has been found for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glycine Antagonist</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuroprotection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAIN</ENAMEX>) trials, which showed no effect on
        clinical or MRI surrogate outcomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>]. This
        comparison is only meaningful if studies are optimally
        designed and equally powered to show effect on their
        respective outcome measures; that is, the optimal sample
        size for imaging studies may be too small to show clinical
        effects. Possible explanations for discordant clinical
        versus surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker</ENAMEX> results are presented in Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
        The concept that improvement as a measure of brain
        lesion volume is a proper surrogate outcome for destructive
        central nervous system diseases has been already accepted
        by academic and regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> alike. Approval of
        beta-interferon for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> was
        based, in part, on lesion volume as a surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker</ENAMEX> of
        disease activity, even though the surrogate was not
        considered fully validated. A surrogate outcome measure in
        clinical trials does not need to be fully validated as a
        condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> approval. Recent changes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
        Food <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Drug and Cosmetic Act</ENAMEX>, which regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval process, have specified a
        fast-track drug designation to expedite review for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
        that have "the potential to address unmet medical needs for
        serious and life-threatening conditions" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> for
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> have fallen under this designation. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> must ordinarily have a beneficial effect on a clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoint</ENAMEX> or on a validated surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">endpoint</ENAMEX> to
        demonstrate effectiveness. The new regulations state that a
        drug "may be approved if it has an effect on a surrogate
        endpoint that is 
        reasonably likely to predict clinical
        benefit. Such surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">endpoints</ENAMEX> are considered 
        not to be validated because, while
        suggestive of clinical benefit, their relationship to
        clinical outcomes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality, is not
        proven" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] (emphasis added). The issue with regard to
        MRI as a surrogate in stroke trials is whether it is
        'reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit'. The
        hypothesis that neuroprotection, the restriction of infarct
        volume, is reasonably likely to be clinically beneficial to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is the premise of virtually all acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
        being developed. The clinical data already discussed
        supports the value of measuring infarct value as a
        surrogate.
        Strict <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">validation</ENAMEX> must eventually be proven but, as we
        see from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> regulations, it is no
        longer required to use lesion volume by MRI as a surrogate
        outcome in stroke trials. A benefit on the surrogate may be
        acceptable as an independent source of confirmatory data in
        support of a clinical benefit seen in a single trial. The
        question, therefore, is no longer whether MRI surrogates
        should be used in trials, but how they should be used.
        The pharmaceutical industry has taken the initiative in
        investigating this final step in validation. The results of
        several industry-sponsored drug trials using MRI as a
        surrogate will be known over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several years</TIMEX>, and
        those studies should provide the most decisive information
        regarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of MRI as a surrogate outcome measure
        in stroke trials. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> multicenter randomized clinical
        trials using MRI as a key selection and outcome variable
        have been completed and reported. Several other trials are
        in progress or being planned.
        In conclusion, there have been concerns raised in the
        past that the use of MRI in stroke clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> is
        impractical for technical and logistical reasons (eg scan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> and availability). The practical limitations have
        disappeared with the widespread availability of ultrafast
        echoplanar imaging with diffusion and perfusion capability
        on commercial MRI scanners. A highly motivated,
        well-coordinated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> can perform emergency diffusion and
        perfusion MRI with a latency to scan and scanning session
        duration comparable with that of emergency head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>. There
        are now over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> worldwide capable of and
        experienced in performing these types of acute MRI
        examinations. Key design issues with regard to the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diffusion</ENAMEX> and perfusion MRI in stroke trials are proposed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>. MRI-based recruitment into trials with a time
        window of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> h has proven feasible, as has specific
        selection based on lesion size, location, and the
        diffusion-perfusion mismatch. As the field of stroke
        clinical trials examines opportunities for improving trial
        design, positive imaging diagnoses in patient selection and
        use of imaging as treatment assessments is likely to assume
        an increasingly useful role. Patient selection and outcomes
        based exclusively on clinical assessment and
        non-hemorrhagic CT scans may no longer be appropriate for
        all trials.
