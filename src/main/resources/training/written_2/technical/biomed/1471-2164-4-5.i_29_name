        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binding</ENAMEX> and recognizing diverse small molecules is a
        central aspect of signal transduction mechanisms in all
        cellular life forms. A variety of environmental small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, namely, nutrients, xenobiotics and first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> are recognized by cells, with the help of
        specialized protein sensors on their surfaces [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        Additionally cells also use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-bound small molecules,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cinnamic acid</ENAMEX>, tetrapyrroles and heme as
        sensors of photons and the ambient redox states [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Within cells, small molecules, such as cyclic nucleotides,
        are used as intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> to transduce signals
        arising from a variety of stimuli [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Over the past
        few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence analysis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> studies have revealed several unifying
        principles that govern the recognition of small molecules
        by cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . A significant component of small
        molecule-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interactions</ENAMEX> is mediated via a relatively
        small set of ancient conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> that bind
        their ligands using specialized pockets [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10</ENAMEX> ] . Certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folds</ENAMEX> have given rise to several large
        superfamilies of ligand-binding domains. These include the
        PAS-like fold, which is the scaffold of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , and probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CACHE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superfamilies</ENAMEX>,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX>-like fold, which is seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ACT</ENAMEX>, ferredoxin and
        related ligand-binding domains [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 15</ENAMEX> ] . Identification of
        such conserved domains has, often, improved our
        understanding of the general structural and biochemical
        features that underlie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-small molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>.
        Typically, these small molecule-binding domains (SMBDs)
        are combined, within the same polypeptide, to a number of
        conserved domains that are directly involved in signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>. These include enzymatic domains such as
        nucleotide cyclases, histidine and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine
        kinases, cNMP phosphodiesterases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">receiver domains</ENAMEX> and
        several different kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Non-catalytic
        domains, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>- or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-binding modules</ENAMEX> (eg. the
        helix-turn-helix domains), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX>-accepting domains, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX> domains that bind phosphorylated peptides, are also
        often fused to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMBDs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        The soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">guanylyl cyclases</ENAMEX> are important signaling
        molecules in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that transduce signals mediated by the
        gaseous first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, NO functions as a neurotransmitter both in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> and peripheral nervous system. NO is released by a
        cell through the action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide synthase</ENAMEX> (NOS)
        on its substrate, the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid arginine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . NO
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diffuses</ENAMEX> through the neighboring cells and elicits its
        functions by activating a soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">guanylyl cyclase</ENAMEX> (SGC)
        that synthesizes cGMP using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTP</ENAMEX> as a substrate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 18</NUMEX> ] .
        The animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SGCs</ENAMEX> are dimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        homologous subunits, α and β. The sequence similarity
        between these subunits extends throughout their entire
        length, and they contain a long extension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal to the
        cNMP generating catalytic domain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of
        the β subunit forms a covalent link with heme via a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histidine</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H105 in human SGC1β</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Though the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">porphyrin</ENAMEX> is identical to that found in hemoglobin, it only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> NO and carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoxide</ENAMEX>, and not <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is present at much higher
        concentrations within the cell [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . This ligand
        specificity of the NO binding domain of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SGCs</ENAMEX> is very
        similar to bacterial cytochrome c' that likewise binds only
        NO and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region of the α subunit
        has been shown to bind certain synthetic pyrazolopyridine
        ligands, which act as potents NO-independent agonists of
        cyclase activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] .
        Using sensitive sequence profile analysis we show that
        the heme-binding domain of the animal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> defines a novel
        family of ligand binding domains that are also widely
        distributed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> also contain a second
        globular domain situated in between the heme-binding and
        cyclase domains. We show that this domain is also present
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and present evidence that these two
        domains are likely to function together both in eukaryotes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, and activate a diverse set of downstream
        signals.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOBA</ENAMEX> domains
          Though both the α and β subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> are
          homologous throughout their entire length, only the β
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit</ENAMEX> contains the critical heme-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>. As
          this long homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extension of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGC</ENAMEX> subunits
          does not map to any previously characterized domains, we
          sought to investigate its provenance through sequence
          analysis methods. The length and conservation pattern of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> is likely to comprise of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          globular domains in the least. This conjecture was also
          supported by an analysis of sequence complexity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide</ENAMEX> using the SEG program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          A PSI-BLAST search was initiated with the conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGC</ENAMEX> (human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SGC1β</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gi</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4504215, region 1-360</ENAMEX>), using an inclusion threshold of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX>, and compositional bias based statistics to eliminate
          false <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positives</ENAMEX> arising due to peculiarities of sequence
          composition. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal parts of this
          extension gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> distinct hits to different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterial proteins</ENAMEX>, supporting the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          distinct globular domains in this extension. Based on
          these hits we divided the extension into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and
          C-terminal parts and initiated separate PSI-BLAST
          searches with them. Searches with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal part of
          the extension gave significant hits to bacterial proteins
          of the length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> within the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iterations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eg. Mdge1313</ENAMEX> from 
          Microbulbifer degradans is detected
          with an expect-value (e) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -4in the first iteration).
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of similarity encompasses the entire length
          of these bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and includes the
          heme-liganding histidine of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGC</ENAMEX> β subunits, and is
          likely to define a distinct globular domain. In order to
          probe this domain further we isolated this region from
          SGC1β (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-185</ENAMEX>) and seeded a PSI-BLAST search that was run
          to convergence. At convergence, this search detected, in
          addition to the soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">guanylyl cyclases</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, several bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> such
          as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desulfovibrio</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clostridium</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Transitive</ENAMEX> searches
          initiated with the small bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that entirely
          correspond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal-most domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> also
          recovered the same set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as observed in the
          earlier search, with e <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><.01</NUMEX>. These observations
          suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal-most domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> is
          evolutionarily mobile: it occurs in several distinct
          contexts with other domains in the same polypeptide, or
          in a stand-alone form.
          PSI-BLAST searches initiated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal part
          of the SGC-specific extension (the region in between the
          above-detected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal-most domain, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          cyclase domain; human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SGC1β</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-370</ENAMEX>) recovered
          homologous regions from all other animal soluble guanylyl
          cyclases, and, additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal regions of
          histidine kinases from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> and 
          Anabaena <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">eg. gi: 17229771,</ENAMEX>
          e = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -4in iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and a diguanylate cyclase from 
          Rhodobacter sphaeroides (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">gi</ENAMEX>:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">22958462 e = 10 -3in iteration 3</ENAMEX>). The region of
          similarity shared by these bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and animal
          SGCs encompassed more-or-less the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">middle region</ENAMEX>,
          which is present between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other globular domains.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reciprocal</ENAMEX> searches with the corresponding region from
          the cyanobacterial histidine kinases recovered the animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX>, thereby confirming the evolutionary relationship
          between these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. These observations suggest that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">middle</ENAMEX> region of the animal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> defines a second
          evolutionarily mobile globular domain that is shared with
          several distinct bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          A multiple alignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal-most domain of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> and its bacterial homologs was prepared using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_coffee</ENAMEX> program and adjusted manually based on the
          PSI-BLAST <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HSPs (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The multiple aligment shows that
          the heme-binding histidine of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGC</ENAMEX>-β subunits is
          contained within this domain. We accordingly termed this
          domain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> eme- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> itric 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> xide 
          B inding) domain. The histidine
          is predicted to be positioned next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus of</ENAMEX>
          an α-helix, and is conserved throughout this superfamily,
          with the exception of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-subunits</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bacterial versions from 
          Rhodobacter sphaeroides and 
          Magnetococcus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Though SGC
          α-subunits lack the histidine, the region encompassing
          the HNOB domain in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SGC1α</ENAMEX> has been shown to be
          important for functional heme binding by the dimeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Hence, in addition to covalent heme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binding</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> domains may also interact with it
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-covalently.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal part of the domain
          contains a universally conserved acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> that may
          play a critical role creating the local environment for
          NO selectivity. The rest of the sequence conservation
          maps mainly to the cores of secondary structure elements
          and some well conserved turns (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Secondary
          structure prediction shows that the HNOB domain is likely
          to adopt a predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">α-helical</ENAMEX> fold with a few
          interspersed extended elements. Further, the predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX>-membrane topologies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> suggest
          an intracellular localization for all occurrences of this
          domain. However, neither direct comparisons, nor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">sequence-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> threading revealed any relationship
          with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other well-characterized α-helical
          heme-binding domains, namely globin and cytochrome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
          Hence, it is likely that the HNOB domain adopts a
          structure distinct from these domains.
          Because the middle domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> is always
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> domains (see below), we named it
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOBA</ENAMEX> ( 
          HNOB 
          A ssociated) domain. A multiple
          alignment of this domain revealed, that unlike the HNOB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, it is likely to adopt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an α</NUMEX> + β fold with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">segregated α</ENAMEX> and β domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Its core contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          conserved strands, followed, at the extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX>,
          by a long helix that is likely to form a coiled-coil
          linker <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> involved in dimerization (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Within
          the core the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strands</ENAMEX> are predicted to form a
          β-hairpin followed by a helical region, which in turn is
          followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> consecutive strands and single α-helix. A
          similar secondary structure pattern is also observed in
          several other ligand-binding domains such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>, profilin and probably even the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CACHE domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ]
          . <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sequence-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> threading using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3DPSSM</NUMEX> method
          detected the PAS domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photoactive</ENAMEX> yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> PDB:
          1drm) with marginally significant scores (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-70%</NUMEX>
          probability of correct fold prediction). This suggests
          that the HNOBA domain could potentially contain a
          PAS-like fold.
          All versions of the HNOBA domain, except <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from 
          Rhodobacter sphaeroides , contain a
          conserved histidine between the core region and the long
          C-terminal α-helix that links it to a kinase or cyclase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, studies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> suggest no
          evidence for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> covalent heme-binding site,
          implying that this histidine could have some other
          function. Interestingly, binding studies on a synthetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pyrazolopyridine SGC</ENAMEX> agonist, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BAY</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-2272</TIMEX> have suggested
          a role for the region <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">236</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX> of the human SGC1 α-subunit
          in interacting with this ligand [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . Though actual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-linking occurred with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cysteine residues</ENAMEX> situated
          just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal to the HNOBA domain, it is likely that
          the rest of domain is involved in contact with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX>. This may suggest the possibility of the HNOBA
          domain binding some, as yet unknown, endogenous ligand.
          In such a scenario it could participate in allosteric
          regulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX>, similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> domains of the
          cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13</ENAMEX> ] .

          The HNOB domain is found in various bacterial lineages
          such as cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and low GC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. It is entirely absent in all
          archaeal proteomes available to date, and amidst the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> is only detectable in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> lineage. In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the HNOB domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> display <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">architectures</ENAMEX>. They may occur as stand-alone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          entirely composed of the HNOB domain, in several
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lineages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and 
          Desulfovibrio desulfuricans they
          occur in combination with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> accepting chemotaxis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor proteins</ENAMEX>, with or without the HAMP domain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] . Additionally, in 
          Magnetococcus , a HNOB domain is
          fused, at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX>, to an uncharacterized conserved
          globular domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> the HNOB domain
          always occurs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extension of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX>. The
          phyletic pattern of the HNOB domain suggests that it was
          most probably acquired early in the evolution of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">animal</ENAMEX> lineage, via lateral transfer from a bacterial
          source. In order to test this further, we used a multiple
          alignment of the HNOB domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) to construct
          phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> joining, least
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">squares</ENAMEX> and maximum-likelihood methods. A consensus tree
          for the HNOB domain superfamily shows that the animal
          versions form a strong monophyletic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, there is a small lineage specific
          expansion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">nematode</ENAMEX> lineage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> with distinct α
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">β subunits</ENAMEX> appear to have emerged in the coelomate
          lineage after its divergence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">nematode</ENAMEX> lineage.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> domains occurring in the chemotaxis
          receptors form a well-supported monophyletic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, while
          the remaining standalone forms are paraphyletic (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Interestingly, the solo versions from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nostoc</ENAMEX> and 
          Anabaena <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> strongly
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> SGC clade, supporting the origin of the
          latter forms via horizontal transfer from a bacterial
          source (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rell BP</ENAMEX> support <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10000</NUMEX> replicates).
          Genes, whose products closely interact with each other
          in macromolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> or biochemical pathways,
          often cluster together in prokaryotic genomes. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-functional gene clusters or operons often provide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contextual</ENAMEX> information that may throw light on the
          functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncharacterized proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . In
          order to obtain a better understanding of the HNOB
          domains, we analyzed the neighborhoods of the genes
          encoding them in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Genes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encoding</ENAMEX> practically all
          the solo versions of the HNOB domain occur in the same
          predicted operon as a histidine kinase or a GGDEF domain
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">diguanylate cyclase</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . In some cases these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operons</ENAMEX> also encode receiver domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the two
          component systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP2C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phosphatases</ENAMEX> or cyclic
          diguanylate phosphodiesterases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Interestingly,
          the histidine kinases from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cyanobacteria, and the
          GGDEF domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from 
          Rhodobacter , which co-occur with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solo HNOB</ENAMEX> domain proteins contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HNOBA</ENAMEX> domains at their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extreme N-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Thus, even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          the HNOBA domain always appears to function in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with the HNOB domain. Given that these
          cyanobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HNOB proteins</ENAMEX> are also the closest
          bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> HNOB domains, it
          appears likely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> lineage acquired a related
          assemblage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOBA</ENAMEX> domain as a single piece.
          Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOBA</ENAMEX> domains resemble functionally
          similar CACHE and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHASE</ENAMEX> domains, which have also been
          acquired by certain eukaryotic lineages via lateral
          transfer from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 36 37</NUMEX> ] . A phylogenetic
          analysis of the guanylyl cyclase domains of the animal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> shows that their closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> are cyclases from
          various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> such cyanobacteria, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leptospira</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Taken
          together, these observations support a potential
          bacterial origin for these components of the nitric oxide
          signaling pathway. This is also consistent with the
          presence of orthologs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> NO synthases in
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] .
          The co-occurrence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOBA</ENAMEX> domains in
          either the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">operon</ENAMEX> suggests a strong functional interaction between
          them. Studies on the human SGC1 suggest that the
          synthetic pyrazolopyridine ligand binds at site distinct
          from NO and heme, but requires the heme-binding site for
          its action [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . This could imply a synergy or
          cooperation between these domains in heme interation and
          cyclase activation. Majority of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HNOB</ENAMEX> domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are predicted to covalently bind heme. Those
          versions that lack the heme-binding histidine might
          either non-covalently interact with heme, as in the case
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGC</ENAMEX> α-subunits, or bind some other unknown ligand.
          They are likely to function as sensors of diffusible
          gaseous ligands that activate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> distinct,
          downstream signaling pathways: namely phosphotransfer
          through the two-component systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl ester</ENAMEX>-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotactic</ENAMEX> response and cyclic nucleotide signaling
          through the diguanylate <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cyclases/phosphodiesterases.</ENAMEX>
          However, further experimental studies would be required
          to determine if they function as NO or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> sensors, like
          the animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, or as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen sensors</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Using sequence profile searches we identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        conserved domains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal extensions of the
        soluble guanylyl cyclases from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these, the
        HNOB domain, contains the heme-binding site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> and
        defines a family of small-molecule binding domains
        exclusively occurring in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. In bacteria
        the HNOB domain occurs either as a standalone version or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAMP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> accepting domains of
        chemotaxis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The bacterial solo versions co-occur
        in predicted operons encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> component
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and diguanylate cyclases or phosphodiesterases, and
        are likely to transmit signals to these downstream
        molecules. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> conserved domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX>, the HNOBA
        domain is always associated with the HNOB domain either in
        the same polypeptide or in polypeptide encoded by
        neighboring genes in an operon. It is predicted to adopt an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">α</ENAMEX> + β fold that is possibly related to the PAS-like fold.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOBA</ENAMEX> domains are likely to function
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synergistically</ENAMEX> or cooperatively. The latter may either
        cooperate in binding heme or might bind distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX>.
        The phyletic pattern of these domains, and phylogenetic
        analysis of the HNOB domain suggest that the animal
        versions were probably acquired through lateral transfer
        from a bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOB</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNOBA</ENAMEX> domains could help in further investigations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SGCs</ENAMEX> that are critical components of the nitric oxide
        signaling pathway in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, investigating
        their role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, such as 
        Vibrio cholerae , could be important
        in understanding the sensory mechanisms of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        The non-redundant (NR) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>) was searched using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTP</ENAMEX> and PSI-BLAST
        programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . Profile searches using the PSI-BLAST
        program were conducted either with a single sequence or an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX> used as the query, with a profile inclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, and were iterated
        until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX>. Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> were constructed
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T_Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , followed by manual
        correction based on the PSI-BLAST results. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protein</ENAMEX>
        secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was predicted using a multiple
        alignment as the input for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPRED</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHD</ENAMEX> programs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] . Preliminary clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was done using
        the BLASTCLUST program with empirically determined length
        and score threshold cut off values (For documentation see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ftp://ftp.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/blast/documents/README</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bcl</ENAMEX>).
        Previously known, conserved domains were identified using
        PSI-BLAST derived profiles for them, with the RPS-BLAST
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sequence-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure threading</ENAMEX> was performed

        were obtained by isolating all conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, in the
        neighborhood of the gene under consideration, which showed
        a separation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 70</NUMEX> nucleotides between their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">termini</ENAMEX>. Genes fulfilling this criterion and occurring in
        the same direction were considered likely to form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operons</ENAMEX>.
        Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor
        joining or least square method followed by local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rearrangements</ENAMEX> using the maximum likelihood algorithm to
        predict the most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The robustness of tree
        topology was assessed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resampling</ENAMEX> of Estimated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Log Likelihoods</ENAMEX> (RELL) bootstrap replicates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLPHY</ENAMEX> and
