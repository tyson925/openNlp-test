        Different organisms have idiosyncratic, and sometimes
        extremely biased, preferences for one synonymous codon over
        another. Although differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage among genes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have been widely studied, general principles
        have been difficult to find. Although it has been known for
        some time that the frequencies of some codons and amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids correlate</ENAMEX> with genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], the causality
        has remained unclear: correlations could exist because
        selection for a particular codon or amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> usage
        produces a particular genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, or because
        mutation towards a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content determines codon
        and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> usage according to combinatorial principles.
        Here we show that codon and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> usage is consistent
        with forces acting on nucleotides, rather than on codons or
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, although both mutation and selection play
        important roles.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Codon</ENAMEX> usage can be surprisingly biased in different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. For example, the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid lysine</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> codons,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAG</ENAMEX>. Although some organisms, such as 
        Lactobacillus acidophilus , use the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> codons equally, others show extreme preferences: 
        Streptomyces venezuelae uses AAA only
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2%</NUMEX> of the time, whereas 
        Buchneria aphidicola uses it for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lysine residues</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Amino-acid</ENAMEX> usage also differs greatly
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>: for instance, the amount of arginine varies
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost ten</NUMEX>-fold, from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1.5%</NUMEX> of all amino-acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in species of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borrelia</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.7%</NUMEX> in 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis (data from
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]). Because of these extreme biases, knowing an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX>'s preferred codon usage is of direct practical
        relevance in minimizing degeneracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers and in
        maximizing the effectiveness of 
        in vivo genetic manipulation. Trends
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage across species could also influence
        molecular phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>, and clarify the
        relative roles of neutral evolution and natural selection
        in determining nucleotide sequences.
        The evolutionary theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">synonymous codon</ENAMEX> usage began
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate lines of research, both of which
        suggested that most substitutions were selectively neutral,
        but which explained different phenomena. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> line
        sought to explain interspecific variation in overall
        sequence composition, and noted correlations between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>
        content and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> content across different species.
        This suggested that genomes were at equilibrium with
        respect to mutation, and explained how directional mutation
        could affect the composition of coding sequences [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 3,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>], although it does not explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with similar
        genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX> have recognizably distinct sequences
        for individual genes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> line sought to explain the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX> and maintenance of sequence variation within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, and the fixation of particular alleles between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. This relied on the concept of silent mutations and
        the relative power of selection and drift in small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. Different usage patterns of synonymous
        codons are invisible at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level: how can
        selection operate when the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> meaning remains
        unchanged [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]? However, without directional mutation
        pressure, the fixation of silent mutants would not lead to
        the extreme biases in synonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage actually
        observed [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has been
        extensively characterized, and linked causally to a wide
        variety of both adaptive and nonadaptive factors including
        tRNA abundance [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14</TIMEX>], gene expression
        level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23</TIMEX>], local
        compositional biases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>], rates and
        patterns of mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> composition
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34, 35, 36</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38, 39</TIMEX>],
        translation optimization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 41, 42</TIMEX>] (but see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]),
        gene length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45, 46, 47</TIMEX>], and mRNA secondary structure
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49, 50, 51, 52</TIMEX>].
        In contrast, trends across species have received far
        less attention. The genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content has been shown to
        correlate with cross-species differences in frequencies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 54</TIMEX>] and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 33, 34, 55, 56, 57</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>]. Genome composition may even influence the structure
        and chemistry of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36, 57, 59</TIMEX>]. Comparing
        different microbial genomes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in individual
        genes also correlates with estimated expression level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX>] and tRNA copy number [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important point is that these regressions are
        ahistorical: by predicting a relationship between gene and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein composition</ENAMEX>, these studies imply that the history
        of a gene or species is unimportant compared to its current
        state. This has important implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or genes
        that have uncertain phylogenetic relationships or differ
        greatly in composition from their close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. Although
        closely related organisms tend to have similar genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compositions</ENAMEX>, there are considerable exceptions (such as 
        Mycoplasma pneumoniae versus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. genitalium</ENAMEX> ). If distantly related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with similar GC contents have the same amino-acid
        or codon usages, we can conclude that phylogenetic
        constraints are relatively unimportant, and perhaps that
        genomes are at or near equilibrium with respect to mutation
        and selection (otherwise, different unrelated species would
        not attain the same amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> composition predicted from
        the nucleotide composition). Such ahistorical relationships
        are particularly useful in cases where the goal is
        prediction of the current state of a sequence (for example,
        for making PCR primers), rather than reconstruction of its
        history.
        Although regression lines have been fitted to
        relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> content and codon and amino-acid
        usage empirically, permitting qualitative inferences,
        quantitative theoretical predictions relating these
        responses to each other have thus far had limited success.
        This can be remedied by taking into account the
        differential effect of selection on the different positions
        within codons. Here we present a simple model, based solely
        on purifying selection and mutation at the nucleotide
        level, that quantitatively predicts both codon and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid</ENAMEX> usage trends across archaea, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
        eukaryotes on the basis of the genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> also provides insights into the causality
        between genome composition and protein composition. Every
        nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence necessarily has an associated GC
        content, but there need be no similarities in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage
        between different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (for
        instance, any specified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content could be obtained by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mixing AAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGG</ENAMEX> codons in different ratios). If GC
        content were an artifact of selection for a particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> or amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> usage, there would be many different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> of arranging the codon frequencies to get the same GC
        content. If, on the other hand, the codon and amino-acid
        usage is an artifact of mutation (or selection) towards a
        particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, the responses of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> codon
        positions to directional nucleotide substitution predict a
        single codon or amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> usage for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. Thus,
        if distantly related species fit the response curves
        predicted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we can conclude either that forces
        at the nucleotide level drive codon and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> usage,
        and there is nothing special about certain codons or amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, or that there is a unique spectrum of preferred
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid usages</ENAMEX> that applies to all species,
        extends over a huge range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX>, and happens to
        match the predictions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> by chance.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Empirical relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> content and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">codon/amino-</ENAMEX>acid frequency
          Graphs regressing codon and/or amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> frequency
          onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content for subsets of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> codons and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> response graphs) have been plotted previously,
          although typically for particular orthologs across up to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57, 58</TIMEX>] or for individual genes within a
          species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 33, 34</TIMEX>]. The exception is an analysis of
          the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content on average amino-acid
          composition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> bacterial species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>]. Here we plot
          only the graph for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arginine codons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGA</ENAMEX> and CGG
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>), and for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, arginine and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">threonine</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>), to illustrate that some codons and
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGC</ENAMEX> and arginine, show a clear
          relationship with genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content; others, such as CGA
          and threonine, show no relationship whatsoever. All amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acids</ENAMEX> differ in frequency by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-fold in
          different species, however, suggesting that most sites
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can tolerate amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitutions</ENAMEX>.
          The following regression analyses assume a specific
          flow of causality: that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content drives codon (and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid</ENAMEX>) usage. We favor this direction because there
          are many ways to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content from different codon
          usages, but only one way to predict a set of codon usages
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. Our interpretation follows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muto</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osawa</ENAMEX>'s seminal demonstration of the high correlation
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of noncoding, exon, intron, tRNA
          and rRNA sequences, which indicates that a common force
          influences the composition of all parts of the genome [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> different properties of the regression line
          could be considered as measures of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">codon</ENAMEX>'s (or amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acid's</ENAMEX>) response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content: the slope (which
          describes the rate of response, or sensitivity, to GC
          content variation), the intercept (marking the lower
          boundary of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, at which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codon</ENAMEX>/amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is
          predicted to disappear), and the correlation coefficient
          (describing the degree of variation in codon/amino-acid
          usage that can be understood in terms of genome GC
          content). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> measures are in fact highly
          correlated with one another (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). We use total GC
          content rather than <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GC3</NUMEX>) for
          the regressions, as total GC is easily measured directly
          in the laboratory for otherwise uncharacterized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>; to estimate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX>, at least some gene sequences
          are required. In principle, it is preferable to use GC3
          where available, as total genome (or coding sequence) GC
          already contains the data used to measure the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content
          at the other positions. Consequently, regressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GC1</ENAMEX> or
          GC2 against total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> might introduce systematic biases,
          whereas regressing against GC3 better represents
          deviation from neutrality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. However, total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> and GC3
          are so highly correlated (in part because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX> changes
          much faster than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC1 and GC2</TIMEX>) that for practical purposes
          it makes no difference.
          The factors determining the response of each codon and
          each amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> to genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content turn out to be
          surprisingly simple. An amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>'s response (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>)
          is determined by the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of its codons (that
          is, the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with particularly AT- or GC-rich
          codons are most sensitive to genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content), which
          explains <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71-79%</NUMEX> of the variance in response, depending on
          the measure used (slope is the poorest fit; correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> is the best). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">codon</ENAMEX>'s response (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>)
          is determined by the difference between its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content
          and the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of its synonyms, explaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71-87%</NUMEX> of the variance. (In other words, genome GC
          content influences the presence or absence of codons with
          extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content more than synonyms with intermediate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. This follows from the fact that the third
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> position changes faster than the other two
          positions, and does not depend directly on the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          that each codon encodes.) This relationship applies to
          both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Most of the diversity in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eukaryotes</TIMEX>, and hence most of the
          significance of the regressions, comes from unicellular
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">multinucleate organisms</ENAMEX>, including fungi and
          protists, rather than from the multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metazoa</ENAMEX>. This is to be expected, because the relatively
          early-diverging protist lineages also account for most of
          the molecular diversity within the eukaryotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>].
          Although the figures reported above include
          termination codons, excluding these codons does not
          greatly affect the result (for instance, 
          R 2increases from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> for
          slope in the codon graph for eukaryotes when the three
          termination codons are excluded). Similarly, excluding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> and methionine, which have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> codon each
          and thus necessarily fall at the origin, makes no
          difference, as the best-fit line (for codons) passes
          through the origin anyway. Excluding stop codons,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> and methionine increases 
          R 2by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 0.019</NUMEX> on average for the
          various measures of response. Excluding stop codons makes
          slightly more difference on the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> graph
          (increasing 
          R 2by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.031</NUMEX> on average, more
          influential than any single amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> point). When stop
          codons, tryptophan and methionine are all excluded, 
          R 2increases by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 0.046</NUMEX> on
          average.
          Interestingly, the same sorts of relationships seem to
          hold within, as well as among genomes. Figure 2cexamines
          the response of codons to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content across individual
          genes within sample genomes representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          domains of life: eukaryotes ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> ), and archaea ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeoglobus</ENAMEX> ). The codon
          frequency in individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> seems to be predictable on
          the basis of the overall GC content of the coding
          sequences: the relative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of individual codons
          explains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the variance in response in their
          absolute frequencies within each coding sequence (that
          is, the presence or absence of a particular codon depends
          on the extent to which alternative synonyms of more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'suitable</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content exist). This is despite the fact
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage in individual genes is known to be
          influenced by a long list of other factors, including the
          amino-acid sequence necessary for the gene's function
          (although the fraction of crucial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> may typically
          be small). The effect cannot be fully explained by
          synonymous substitutions, because codons with the same
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-position base but different codon doublets respond
          differently.
          Before proceeding, we note that these plots themselves
          emphasize the causality within the system. Our analysis
          shows that all amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and all codons behave in a
          predictable manner within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each genome</TIMEX>, indicating that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content within coding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> determines the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> (and hence amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX>) composition rather than
          being a passive reflection of a preferred codon or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid</ENAMEX> usage. Hence, this uniform robustness supports
          the idea that there is little special about particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> or amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> domains of life, it
          appears that every codon and every amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> follows a
          single trend determined by the overall compositional
          properties of genomes. Even within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">genomes</TIMEX>, the overall
          composition of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> seems to explain up to
          half the variance in the responses of the individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codons</ENAMEX> and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. This raises the question: what
          drives <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content?
        
        
          A mutational model
          The simple empirical relationship between the
          composition of codons and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and their responses
          to changing genome composition suggests that these
          responses might be quantitatively predictable on
          theoretical grounds. We take as our starting points
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sueoka</ENAMEX>'s hypothesis that genome composition is largely
          determined by mutation bias, specifically the ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT→GC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC→AT</ENAMEX> mutations [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 29, 32</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muto</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osawa</ENAMEX>'s demonstration that different types of sequence,
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> codon positions within exon sequences, vary
          in their response to genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content with the third
          position changing the fastest, which suggests that the
          different observed substitution rates might be explained
          by the differential effects of mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>].
          We assume for simplicity that the genome is divided
          into two types of site - constant and variable; that all
          variable sites respond identically to mutational
          pressure; and that all <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-position sites are variable
          (that is, that under this initial model there is no
          selective consequence to silent mutations). Accordingly,
          GC3 (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-position <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content) reflects the ratio of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT→GC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC→AT</ENAMEX> mutations. When plotted against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX>, the
          slope of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the GC1 and GC2</TIMEX> graphs give the intensity of
          selection at those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positions relative to GC3 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>],
          whereas the values at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> give the
          identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at the constant positions (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In other words, when all the variable sites (as
          measured by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX>) are as biased as possible towards one
          state, we assume that any sites at position 1 or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> that
          still have the opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are maintained by selection
          and cannot change. Thus, the frequency of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codon</ENAMEX> can
          be estimated as:
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XYZ</ENAMEX>] =

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> probabilities sum to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X|c</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ] denotes the conditional
          probability of getting base <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> at a constant site at
          position n, and

          to be the same across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX>).
          Comparing the responses of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC1 and GC2</TIMEX> to GC3 (Figure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>), we can see that:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC1</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost</NUMEX> identical. However, the bacterial/archaeal slope
          differs significantly from the eukaryotic slope. Thus,
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-position <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are less labile among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> tested. (Note that the number of degrees of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">freedom</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">n1</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">n2 - 4</ENAMEX>: the data are constrained by a sum
          and a regression mean<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-square</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC2</TIMEX> are not significantly different
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three domains</TIMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The intercepts for archaea and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> do not
          differ, except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC2</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GC3</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>. The intercepts
          for the pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">archaea</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> sample always differ from
          those of eukaryotes.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Archaea behave far more like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> than like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kolmogorov-Smirnov</ENAMEX> test in two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX> as implemented in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          B = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">311</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX>: for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC1</TIMEX> versus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX>, D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX>, P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>, D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX>, P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>; for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC2</TIMEX> versus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX>, D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.21</NUMEX>, P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>; D 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX>, P 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AE</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>. Differences between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, or between eukaryotes and the
          combined archaeal/bacterial data set, were highly
          significant ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 10 -6that</ENAMEX> both represent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> drawn from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> for each pairwise
          test).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The general patterns are replicated in the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. Thus, the relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-,
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-position <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content emerges
          independently in evolutionarily separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subdividing</ENAMEX> each domain shows that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lineages</ENAMEX> have
          explored the same wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> contents, reproducing
          the same relationships.
          The major distinction is between eukaryotes and
          prokaryotes, which presumably has an ecological or
          structural rather than a phylogenetic explanation. The
          slopes may be different because of the great differences
          in genome size and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> time, or because the
          partitioning of genetic material into the specialized
          environment of the nucleus changes patterns of mutation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eukaryotes</ENAMEX> also have far more noncoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, which could
          potentially isolate coding regions from selection for
          genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content if this were an important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>:
          however, for this analysis we consider only the coding
          regions, which still differ greatly in composition among
          different eukaryotes (suggesting that selection has not
          acted to conserve the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of coding sequences).
          The intercepts may be different because the set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in each domain differs, and so the distribution
          of nucleotides in critical sites need not be conserved.
          It is also possible that the selection of genes that have
          been studied differs between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, although the few
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> for which complete genomes are known are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX>. To reflect the major differences separating the
          eukaryotes from the other domains, we pooled the archaeal
          and bacterial data and contrast this with the eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, fitting slopes and intercepts to the model for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> separately.
        
        
          Does the model accurately reflect codon
          usage?
          The model outlined above requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> parameters
          (estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC1 and GC2</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>)
          defined from the data, and uses these to predict the
          slopes and intercepts of regressions on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of the
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">64 codons</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> codon sets (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and
          termination). As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is deterministic, it is not
          useful for predicting the correlation coefficients. When
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">composition</ENAMEX> is summed across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> codon positions
          (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGT</ENAMEX> would be counted among the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codons</ENAMEX> comprised of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> or C and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> A or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">A</ENAMEX>/T at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> position), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is remarkably
          accurate for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4a-c</TIMEX>) and eukaryotes
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4d</NUMEX>), though in each case, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GC3</TIMEX> shows the greatest
          deviations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (perhaps indicating that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GC3</ENAMEX> is 'fine tuned' by the other selective
          pressures linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage).
          This model even performs moderately well when applied
          to a random sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the 
          Drosophila genome (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4e</NUMEX>):
          although the unexplained variance is much greater, the
          points clearly cluster around the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> lines predicted
          by the position-dependent model rather than the single
          (orange) line that overall composition alone would
          predict (as in previous, simpler <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>). In each case,
          the white-centered lines are the theoretical predictions,
          and each dark point represents a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The orange line
          is the frequency that would be expected from the GC
          content without taking into account the
          position-dependent composition biases, that is by (GC)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-GC</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-n</TIMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> is the genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> is
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> in the codon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>]. Taking the
          position dependence into account thus provides a much
          better fit to the data.
          We compare the predicted and actual slopes for each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> codons in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> explains <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in slopes for the regression of codon frequency
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content in eukaryotes, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the variance in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotes</ENAMEX>. Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is an unbiased
          estimator: the slopes are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and the intercepts are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>.
          The results are similar for the intercepts, and for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid usages</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Can selection account for the remaining
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>?
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-parameter model discussed above assumes, for
          the sake of simplicity, that A = T and C = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s
          rule). For double-stranded DNA molecules, this is
          necessarily true because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Crick</ENAMEX> base pairing.
          Less well known is the intra-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s rule,
          which states that the same relationship holds within
          large, single-stranded DNA molecules (in particular, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strands of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis genome</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>]. The interpretation of this intra-strand rule is
          statistical rather than mechanical: if there are no
          biases in mutation and selection between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strands,
          or if genes are distributed evenly between the two
          strands, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C→G</ENAMEX> mutation on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> strand (for example)
          cannot be distinguished from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G→C</ENAMEX> mutation on the other.
          Thus, the twelve possible nucleotide-substitution rates
          reduce to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just six</NUMEX> and, at equilibrium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s rule
          should hold even within the set of coding sequences in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. As long as all nucleotide-substitution
          rates are positive, this equilibrium condition holds for
          all possible substitution matrices [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX>].
          In actual genomes, however, the intra-strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s rule is frequently violated because the
          leading and lagging strands have different substitution
          patterns and genes are not evenly distributed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. In
          respect of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, not only the position of a base but
          also its identity affects how fast it responds to genome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, the intra-strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s rule is violated in a position-dependent
          manner. For both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the third
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> position is pyrimidine-rich (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C3/G3</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.11</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.15</NUMEX>
          respectively; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T3/A3</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.24</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.36</NUMEX>), and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> codon
          position is purine-rich (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C1/G1</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.58</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.62</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T1/A1</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.63 and 0.65</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> codon position is mixed (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">C2/</ENAMEX>G2
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.34</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.32</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">T2/A2</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.87</NUMEX>). Consequently,
          relaxing the assumption of the intra-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s
          rule should increase the accuracy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
          These differences in composition could reflect coding
          constraints, if a functional proteome required a
          particular amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid composition</ENAMEX>. As we have seen,
          however, the frequency of particular amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> varies
          greatly among different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, decreasing the
          likelihood that there is a unique, optimal composition.
          Additionally, the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> respond predictably with
          changing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, in a manner consistent with
          processes acting only at the level of single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>.
          If the bases do not change at the same rates, the
          assumption that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content at each position
          completely describes the nucleotide composition is
          unwarranted. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-parameter model discussed above
          assumes that, for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> codon positions, each
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bases changes equally rapidly with changing
          genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. Interestingly, this is not actually
          the case. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> changes far more slowly than any
          other nucleotide when at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> codon position, but
          faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> when at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> codon position.
          Furthermore, A at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> position changes nearly
          twice as fast as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> position (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). This
          violates the assumption that all variable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
          equal.
          Is there any rationale behind these seemingly
          arbitrary rates? Here, selection rather than mutation may
          provide an answer. Most mutations are deleterious;
          furthermore, the greater the effect of a particular
          change, the less likely it is to be advantageous [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>].
          We can estimate the average effect of changing each base
          at each position according to a method used previously to
          calculate the effects of errors in individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codons</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>]. Briefly, for each mutation, the difference in 'polar
          requirement' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70, 71</TIMEX>] between amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids encoded</ENAMEX> by the
          original and new codons is squared. The resulting error
          value is averaged for all applicable mutations, weighting
          transitions more heavily than transversions because they
          occur more frequently (in this case, by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> as
          reported in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX>] for comparison of human pseudogenes
          with their functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>). This gives an 
          a priori estimate of the impact of
          a given set of mutations based on the chemical properties
          of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and the configuration of the genetic
          code.
          In fact, the mean-square error does an excellent job
          of accounting for the difference in slopes. The
          mean-square errors give a logarithmic fit to the rates of
          change, but because there is no reason to believe this
          functional relation to be the correct one we used a
          nonparametric test for correlation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman's</ENAMEX> rank
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX>]). For eukaryotes, 
          r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">s = -0.83</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>); for prokaryotes, 
          r 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">s = -0.86</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>); 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> in both cases. The rank
          order of the mean-square errors does not change when the
          modular power and/or the transition bias are varied over
          the range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, so the correlations are robust
          across parameter space. In other words, because the rate
          of change of the different nucleotides depends on the
          magnitude of error introduced on average by altering
          them, we interpret the variable response of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content at
          each position to be dependent on base identity as the
          result of selection against substitution of dissimilar
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Relaxing the constraints of the model
          To take differential selection into account, we relax
          the assumption of the intra-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s rule as
          follows. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-parameter model presented above
          requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters each for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regression lines,
          relating the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-position <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content to the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-position <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. However, if the frequencies of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides at each codon position can vary
          independently with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content (subject to the constraint
          that the nucleotide frequencies at each position are
          constrained by a sum), it is necessary to characterize
          the regression lines of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> at each position to
          make predictions about the nucleotide composition of the
          set of constant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at each position, and of the most
          likely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of variable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> GC
          content.
          Hence we constructed a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24-parameter</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 bases × 3</ENAMEX>
          positions × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> parameters for each regression line) where,
          for each position, we plotted the percentage of each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> against total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content. For a given
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, the expected frequency of a particular
          base at a particular position is estimated directly from
          its regression line, which is based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parameters
          (the slope and the intercept). This takes into account
          the fact that an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> at a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content will
          predictably violate the intra-strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chargaff</ENAMEX>'s rule in
          its coding sequences. This could be considered an
          extension of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takahata</ENAMEX>'s analysis of rate heterogeneity
          among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX>], but extended for the
          reading-frame-dependent selection in coding sequences.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> actually has only <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 degrees</NUMEX> of freedom (rather
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>), as the sums are constrained, but predicts a set
          of codon frequencies that potentially has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">63 degrees</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">freedom</ENAMEX>.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 24-parameter</TIMEX> model explains somewhat more of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in both codon and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> responses (slope
          and intercept), although the marginal benefit is greater
          in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The
          improvement in 
          R 2can explain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40%</NUMEX> of the
          variance unexplained by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-parameter model in some
          cases (amino-acid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> in archaea/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>), although
          in other cases the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> does not offer an
          improvement (for example, amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid intercepts</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible interpretation is that for our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set selection plays a greater role in the genome
          composition of prokaryotes. This is certainly plausible
          given the bias in eukaryotic sequences towards large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. More generally, we may
          infer that, on the scale of whole genomes, differential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and selection between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strands play
          relatively little role in determining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content of individual codons
        and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is the primary determinant of their
        response to biases in sequence composition, both among and
        (to a lesser extent) within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">genomes</TIMEX>. Although the
        literature contains many examples of correlations between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content and the frequency of particular codons and amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is able to recapture quantitatively the
        behavior of essentially all codons and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invoking</ENAMEX> forces that act only on the level of individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX>. This is likely to be due to a combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and selection: mutation can act in parallel across
        an entire genome, changing many sites simultaneously;
        however, this process is limited by the consequences of
        error at each position.
        The simplest hypothesis, that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage depends solely
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon GC</ENAMEX> content [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>], fits the data poorly (compare
        orange lines with red, green and blue lines in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        One can, however, explain most of the variance in the
        response of both codons and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> by taking into
        account the fact that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> codon positions change at
        different rates, and that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleotides</ENAMEX> are not
        evenly distributed among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> that are functionally
        constrained. Additionally, accounting for the fact that the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nucleotides change at different rates allows some
        further improvement, which ranges from minimal to drastic
        depending on the exact circumstances. This supports the
        basic principle of neutral evolution, the idea that most
        change in nucleotide and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> is driven by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> and limited by purifying selection that varies for
        different sites and molecules (reviewed in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>]). Within
        this context, it supports the idea that most of this
        neutral change is driven by directional mutation, which
        thus explains differences in nucleotide composition among
        species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Although the conclusion that amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with GC-rich
        codon doublets are more frequent in GC-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>, and
        that those with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AU</ENAMEX>-rich codon doublets are more frequent in
        AT-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>, is neither new nor surprising [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>], our
        model accurately and quantitatively predicts these
        responses for essentially all codons and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invoking</ENAMEX> forces acting on individual nucleotides. The
        genetic code constrains which codons and which amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
        can respond to biases in nucleotide composition, in part
        because mixed codons necessarily respond more slowly to
        forces acting on particular types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> than do
        homogeneous codons. Thus, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX> content only explains
        the variance in usage of some codons and some amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
        we can accurately predict which codons and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> will
        show clear responses and, for those that do show clear
        responses, accurately predict their frequencies in
        particular genomes (for example, Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1shows</TIMEX> an example
        of a codon for which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> of the variance in usage is
        explained by genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, and an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> for which
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> of the variance is explained). Thus, especially for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with few close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, variable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may even
        be more useful for predicting PCR primer sequences than
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, although this will depend on the
        particular sequence and genome composition.
        We have focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage at the level of whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> (or samples of genes where whole genomes are not
        available), an area that has received relatively little
        attention. This large-scale view does not consider the
        selective factors influencing individual genes, and the
        fact that the model provides much better fit across genomes
        than within them may reflect local adaptation to factors
        such as expression level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. What remains surprising is
        that our simple model can explain so much of the variance
        in codon and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content in these
        different systems. Identifying deviations from the
        predictions based on nucleotide composition may identify
        genes that are under unusual selection pressures, whether
        for a particular amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid composition</ENAMEX> or for a specific
        pattern or degree of codon bias.
        The fact that both amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage are so
        closely entwined with genome composition has important
        practical implications. For phylogenetic analysis, the fact
        that some amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (such as arginine) change rapidly and
        predictably with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content slightly undermines the idea
        that amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> are more stable than nucleotide
        sequences: pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with convergent GC contents
        might also evolve convergent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>, especially
        at functionally unconstrained positions. For example, the
        frequencies of both lysine and arginine are highly (but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oppositely</ENAMEX>) correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content, and lysine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginine</ENAMEX> can easily substitute for one another in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> domains of life has explored a wide range
        of genome GC contents, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> at the extremes of the
        range but with different evolutionary histories may share
        more convergent amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> than currently
        recognized.
        For sequence analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects</ENAMEX> are more promising:
        given very limited information about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (the GC
        content), it may be possible to estimate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">codon</ENAMEX> usage
        and therefore minimize the degeneracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers, even
        if no closely related species have been characterized.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> with extreme genome <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX>, or with genome
        compositions that differ markedly from their close
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> (such as 
        Mycoplasma pneumoniae versus other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycoplasmas</ENAMEX>) should be particularly accessible. This should
        be especially useful in developmental genetics and in
        environmental applications where model systems are not
        available.
        The fact that the model holds independently for
        different lineages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>), and, to a lesser extent, for individual genes
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, strongly suggests that the trends are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ahistorical</ENAMEX>. Given rates of change for each nucleotide at
        each codon position, determined jointly by selection,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, and the genetic code structure, we can predict
        the codon and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> composition of a particular
        sequence from its overall compositional properties, without
        reference to related sequences. Interestingly, the history
        of a sequence seems relatively important in determining its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">codon</ENAMEX> and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> usage. This fact is likely to be
        particularly important in cases where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> diverges
        greatly in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content from its closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>: knowing
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content will allow much better prediction of
        specific gene sequences than simple comparison with
        conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in related sequences (which may in some
        cases be similar because of shared genome composition
        rather than functional constraint).
        Finally, our model explains many of the details of
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">codon</ENAMEX> and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> responses over the wide
        range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome compositions</ENAMEX> found in nature. Perhaps
        surprisingly, individual amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with specific
        structural or functional roles within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (such as and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arginine</ENAMEX>) respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content no differently than the
        rest, and their frequencies can be very sensitive to genome
        composition despite the effects this might have on the
        properties of the translated products. This ability of
        amino-acid frequencies to vary so widely implies that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">functional proteins</ENAMEX> may be less constrained by sequence
        (and therefore easier to evolve) than previously
        imagined.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Species</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene codon</ENAMEX> usage totals were downloaded from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CUTG (Codon Usage Tabulated</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 76</ENAMEX>], which
        is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank Release 117.0</ENAMEX>. Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">675</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding sequences tabulated from nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, we excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> eukaryotes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> on the
        grounds that they had alternative genetic codes (for
        example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetrahymena</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycoplasma</ENAMEX> ), or had introns
        accidentally tabulated in the database as part of the
        coding sequence (for example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pongo</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homo</ENAMEX> ). These were detected as an
        excess of termination codons greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> coding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (that is, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 5%</NUMEX> more stop codons than
        genes). We excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional nine</NUMEX> eukaryotes for which
        a few genes had been tabulated repeatedly as independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (for example, 
        Naja atra ), leaving a sample size of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">311</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> archaea, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX> eukaryotes with at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> distinct coding sequences tabulated in the database. The
        choice of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> coding sequences was arbitrary, intended to
        ensure a sufficiently large sample size to estimate
        properties of entire genomes; raising the stringency to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 or 100</NUMEX> coding sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288 and 176</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, respectively) reduced the size of our data set but
        gave almost identical results (data not shown). We made no
        attempt to separate the genes by chromosome (for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>), expression level, or location, except that
        organellar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were not considered. Except where
        otherwise noted, 'total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC</ENAMEX>' refers to the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GC</ENAMEX> content
        of coding sequences, rather than of genomes. These values
        are sufficiently highly correlated that it makes no
        difference which is used.
        We estimated nucleotide and amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid compositions</ENAMEX> for
        genomes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> sum records from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUTG</ENAMEX>, which sum
        the codons for all nuclear coding sequences deposited in
        GenBank for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. We did not make any effort to
        exclude short, truncated, duplicated or hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
        although comparison with a filtered data set based on an
        earlier release of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> revealed no significant
        differences (data not shown). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> made
        contributions proportional to their lengths.
        Codon frequencies were calculated both including and
        excluding termination codons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> reported here include
        termination codons. Because termination codons are rare,
        this does not significantly alter the results, except for
        allowing inferences about the relative usage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAA</ENAMEX>, UAG
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UGA</ENAMEX> as termination signals.
