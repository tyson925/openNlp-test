        In an early attempt to relate theoretical concepts and
        empirical results bearing on the molecular basis of
        evolution, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohta</ENAMEX> listed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> principles of
        molecular evolution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these deals with
        the concept of the molecular clock and predicts that, as
        long as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>'s function remains unaltered, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX>'s rate of evolution will be approximately constant
        within different phylogenetic lineages. From this
        principle, it follows that detection of changes in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX>'s rate of evolution may reveal functional changes [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. This rate-constancy prediction is tested here by
        studying the relative rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution in a
        simple phylogenetic context. The test relies on the
        simultaneous analysis of numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> that
        represent complete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets from sequenced genomes or
        partial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets from genomes of which a significant
        fraction has been sequenced. Consistent with the
        rate-constancy prediction, given a phylogenetic tree
        topology, the ratio of evolutionary distances along
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> should be approximately
        constant for all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from an analyzed set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        Clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX> from bacterial,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeal</ENAMEX> and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> sets of size <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were
        analyzed with respect to this prediction. Specifically, for
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phylogeny</ENAMEX>, the length of the longest branch
        was compared to the sum of the two shorter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Such a genome-scale test allowed for a robust
        assessment of the rate constancy of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution, as
        well as the detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> cases of accelerated
        evolutionary change and a quantitative assessment of the
        fraction of genes that undergo such acceleration.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Genomic-scale relative rates test
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> genomes of intracellular pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> of
          the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chlamydiaceae</ENAMEX> ( 
          Chlamydophila pneumoniae , 
          Chlamydia trachomatis and 
          Chlamydia muridarum ) and three
          genomes of archaeal hyperthermophiles of the genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> ( 
          Pyrococcus abyssi , 
          P. horikoshii and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. furiosus</ENAMEX> ) were chosen for
          analysis. Orthologs were identified using the rationale
          and procedure that underlie the construction of clusters
          of orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (COGs) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. This
          approach has been designed to maximize the likelihood of
          identification of orthologs when complete genomes are
          compared. A modified approach involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
          steps was used to identify probable orthologs among the
          encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> partially completed mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX>), 
          Mus musculus (mouse) and 
          Rattus norvegicus (rat).
          These procedures resulted in a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">703</NUMEX>
          Chlamydiaceae, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,305</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,112</NUMEX> mammalian
          orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets. Each orthologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-sequence set was aligned and the evolutionary
          distances between sequences within the sets were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computed</ENAMEX>. These distances were used in phylogenetic
          reconstructions for all orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets. For
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, branch lengths were averaged to
          produce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> shown (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Each of the trees
          contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> relatively short branches of virtually
          identical length and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> long branch, forming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main
          phylogenetic partitions. The rate-constancy prediction
          holds that the evolutionary rates along these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> should be correlated. In other
          words, the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> A (bA) should be correlated
          with the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">bB</NUMEX> + bC) (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) resulting, in an ideal case, in a constant bA/(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">bB</NUMEX>+bC)
          ratio.
          This prediction was tested by evaluating the branch
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lengths</ENAMEX> estimated from alignments of orthologous protein
          sets of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX>. Consistent with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prediction</ENAMEX>, there is a highly significant positive
          correlation between bA and bB + bC for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> species
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Thus, the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          each analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> seem to evolve in accord
          with the rate-constancy prediction, suggesting that the
          functional constraints among orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> remain
          largely unchanged. However, in each group of species
          there are outliers (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) that do not conform to the
          expected pattern of variation. For each of the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous protein</ENAMEX> sets, upper and lower
          limits of the distance from the linear trend line that
          correspond to an expectation value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were
          determined. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All</NUMEX> points above and below these lines
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) represent statistically significant deviants
          from the linear trend, given the standard error and the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous protein</ENAMEX> sets analyzed for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Points above the upper limit line show
          more variation between the phylogenetic partitions (that
          is, longer bA) than expected by chance, and points below
          the lower limit line show more variation within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partition</ENAMEX> (that is, longer bB and/or bC) than expected.
          The majority of the deviants fall above the upper limit.
          These points represent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with an accelerated rate
          of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitution</ENAMEX> between phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partitions</ENAMEX>. The less frequent outlier points below the
          lower line represent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have undergone
          accelerated evolution in one or both of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more
          closely related species in the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. All
          of the orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets that showed significant
          deviations from the linear trend were re-analyzed using
          BLAST similarity searches followed by phylogenetic
          analysis. This was done to verify that these sets contain
          orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX>, it is
          expected that they will form monophyletic clades without
          any intervening paralogs or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from distantly
          related species. For all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiaceae</ENAMEX> and mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sets
          do in fact consist of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX>. However, the 
          Pyrococcus analysis yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          cases where orthology could not be ascertained. These
          ambiguous 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> sets were removed and
          the linear relationship between bA and bB +bC was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-assessed. The total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous protein</ENAMEX> sets
          that show evidence of accelerated evolution suggestive of
          functional diversification is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 0.76% and 1%</NUMEX> of the
          total number of such sets analyzed for each species
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiaceae</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/703</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11/1305</NUMEX>,
          human-mouse-rat= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16/2112</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Nucleotide-substitution rates
          A number of cases of positive selection at the
          molecular level have been supported by comparison of the
          rates of synonymous (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) and non-synonymous (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a ) substitution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a > <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> is considered unequivocal evidence
          of positive selection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. With this in mind,
          comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a were carried out for the orthologous
          protein sets that showed a pattern of variation
          consistent with functional diversification in the
          whole-genome test (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). For the bacterial and
          archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX>, the vast majority of these
          comparisons were inconclusive because the evolutionary
          distance between phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">partitions</ENAMEX> resulted in a
          saturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> . The more closely related
          human-mouse-rat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> did not show saturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> . Comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a for functionally diversified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammalian protein</ENAMEX> sets did not reveal any cases with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a > <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> . This is probably due to the fact
          that, if directional selection led to the acceleration of
          the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> substitution rate in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, it
          acted in an episodic manner [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>] and on a minority of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> against a constant background of purifying
          selection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]. This is consistent with previous work
          suggesting that adaptive changes are difficult to find
          using the strict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a > <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s criterion and that even documented
          cases of positive selection can be missed using this
          technique alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]. The average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a is, however, significantly higher
          for the putative functionally diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> than
          for the total dataset (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The mammalian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with an increased rate of amino-acid
          substitution between the human and rodent lineages also
          show a level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s significantly higher than that of
          the total dataset (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This can be explained by the
          fact that, consistent with previous reports [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 14, 15</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>], we observe a positive correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.556</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P < 10 -10</ENAMEX>). This correlation
          could reflect a mechanistic bias in mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 18</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>] or synonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> may be subject to some degree of
          selection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 23</TIMEX>] (or both). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s ratio is also significantly higher
          for the sets of putative functionally diversified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), indicating a relative acceleration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid substitution</ENAMEX>, which could be due to a
          relaxation of functional constraints and/or directional
          selection.
        
        
          Functional prediction and phyletic
          distribution
          There are some notable similarities in the (predicted)
          functional identities and the phyletic distributions of
          the putative functionally diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sets</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX> are enriched for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that appear to function at the periphery of the
          cells and mediate their interaction with the environment.
          Specifically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chlamydiaceae</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of the
          11 
          Pyrococcus cases and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          mammalian cases are (predicted) membrane or secreted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Some of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          completely uncharacterized and could associate with
          membranes by other mechanisms that do not involve
          recognizable structural features such as signal peptides
          or transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. The mammalian set of
          functionally diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, for which much more
          experimental information is available than for the
          bacterial and archaeal sets, is particularly enriched for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">secreted proteins</ENAMEX>, including several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> surveillance and defense (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). An example of
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that is implicated in a different class of
          functions, but is still related to defense mechanisms is
          the predicted restriction endonuclease from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> . Generally, the
          functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for which accelerated evolution was
          detected and functional diversification inferred are
          compatible with the previously reported cases of
          accelerated evolution which is particularly prominent,
          for example, in the immune system [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
          The phyletic distribution of the functionally
          diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is typically narrow, particularly in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiaceae</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have no homologs
          outside this bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>). Although the selected 
          Pyrococcus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> showed more
          evolutionary conservation, the majority had orthologs
          only in other archaeal genomes, if not only in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus</ENAMEX> . Similarly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> selected mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were either
          mammal-specific or vertebrate-specific (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> clear exceptions to this pattern of poorly
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> primarily involved in defense and
          extracellular signaling were the mammalian enzymes
          hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydroxy acid oxidase</ENAMEX>.
          Accelerated evolution in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with a narrow phyletic
          distribution may represent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-specific adaptations
          in how each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> responds to and processes unique
          environmental cues.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present results show that the mode of evolution of
        the vast majority of the analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
        domains of life - <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, archaea and eukaryotes is
        compatible with the rate-constancy prediction of molecular
        evolution. A recent analysis of the genome-wide
        distribution of the evolutionary rates of prokaryotic genes
        suggested that the shape of this distribution does not
        significantly change during evolution, although the rates
        themselves may change [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. This is consistent with the
        present finding of a strong correlation between
        evolutionary rates in different phylogenetic partitions.
        However, with remarkable consistency, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> analyzed here, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1%</NUMEX> of orthologous genes
        seem to have experienced accelerated evolution, suggesting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> and potentially adaptive diversification that is
        conspicuous enough to be detected at a statistically
        significant level.
        It is also a formal possibility that some of the genes
        identified as functionally diversified may be losing their
        function. As this would entail a change in function, it can
        be considered as a special type of functional
        diversification. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points argue against this
        possibility. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s /K</ENAMEX> 
        a values for mammalian genes are all

        do not show evidence of loss of function or of pseudogenes.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequence alignments</ENAMEX> of the diversified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> show that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> still retain the identity
        of critical domains, such as signal peptides and
        transmembrane domains, as well as critical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the
        active sites of enzymes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and</ENAMEX> data not shown).
        Accelerated evolution and functional diversification
        between paralogs is thought to be common in evolution and
        is posited as a major mechanism for the generation of new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and new biochemical functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Functional
        diversification between orthologs is considered to be much
        less common, however. In fact, directional selection
        leading to functional diversification between orthologs is
        the least common form of natural selection observed at the
        molecular level [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In the present study, the
        implementation of a simple test designed specifically to
        exploit the availability of numerous complete and partially
        complete genome sequences facilitated the detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> cases of probable functional diversification
        between orthologs. Application of this method to the
        growing set of complete genomes is expected to yield
        similar results and may reveal numerous additional cases of
        functionally diversified orthologs.

          Sequence analysis
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiaceae</ENAMEX> genomes and three
          closely related 
          Pyrococcus genomes were chosen for
          analysis. These genomes were chosen on the basis of three
          criteria. First, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more closely related
          complete genome sequences available; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the genomes
          were closely enough related to avoid saturation of
          amino-acid changes and to ensure unambiguous
          identification of orthologs; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, the genomes were
          distantly enough related to provide meaningful
          information on amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> variation. Predicted proteomes
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Chlamydiaceae genomes</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chlamydophila pneumoniae - CWL029</ENAMEX>, 
          Chlamydia muridarum and 
          Chlamydia trachomatis ) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
          Pyrococcus genomes ( 
          P. abyssi and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. horikoshii</ENAMEX> ) were obtained from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX> (NCBI)
          public server [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The predicted proteome for the 
          P. furiosus genome was obtained
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequencer</ENAMEX>'s site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. The method for
          identifying probable orthologs is based on the
          genome-specific best hits (BeTs) rationale that underlies
          the construction of the COGs database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>]. For each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of genomes, all-against-all BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] comparisons
          were done using the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. For each
          query sequence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BeT</ENAMEX> (highest score or lowest
          expectation value) to each of the other proteomes was
          recorded. Triangles of mutually consistent symmetrical
          BeTs were detected to form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>. Only COGs with one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> (ortholog) from each genome (COGs of size
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) were considered for further analysis. This
          sequence-similarity-based approach is generally not
          dependent on constant rates of evolution and thus is not
          misled by rate variation. However, it is a formal
          possibility that misidentification of orthologs could
          result from cases of extreme rate variations that would
          make the orthologs less similar to each other than to
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralogs</ENAMEX>. This possibility was examined using
          phylogenetic analysis, as described below.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Messenger RNA sequences</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> norvegicus , 
          Mus musculus and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo sapiens</ENAMEX> were obtained using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>'s batch Entrez server [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. The encoded amino-acid
          sequences were clustered at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> similarity threshold
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLASTCLUST</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] to remove redundant sequences. The
          BeT procedure was used to identify perfectly symmetrical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> of size <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> for this species <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Because these
          mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genomes</ENAMEX> are not complete, a formal possibility
          exists that the COGs procedure will isolate
          non-orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets. For this reason, two
          additional steps were added to the ortholog
          identification procedure. Subsequent to the construction
          of human-mouse-rat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> and phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the
          'triplet test' [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] was used to further ensure that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> of size <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> contained only orthologs. The triplet test
          verifies that the mouse and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> are
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> equidistant from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. In
          addition to the triplet test, the distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s between human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> was used to
          eliminate potentially non-orthologous sequence sets. In
          both cases, the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately normal</TIMEX>, with the
          exception of long and sparsely populated tails. Sequence
          sets that fell in the tails of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.35</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse-rat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 1.0</NUMEX> for human-rodent) were
          removed before analysis to eliminate potentially
          non-orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets. This manual selection
          process does not appear to bias the results in any way
          (for example, by eliminating a certain functional class
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>). Omitting this step resulted in the inclusion
          of a number of distantly related and poorly aligned
          sequence sets that may not actually include orthologs.
          Thus, the relative rates test as implemented for the
          mammalian dataset is a conservative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Furthermore, the
          most rapidly evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will not be included in the
          analysis as many of them will not have detectable
          orthologs even in closely related genomes.
          Orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence sets were aligned using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] with default options. Alignments that
          resulted in any branch lengths (based on the corrected
          gamma distance, see below) longer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the case of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiaceae</ENAMEX> and 
          Pyrococcus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species groups</ENAMEX> or longer
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in the case of the human-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse-rat species</ENAMEX> group
          were visually inspected and adjusted manually. Manual
          adjustment included removal of poorly aligning and/or
          low-sequence-complexity regions identified by BLAST.
          These adjustments did not result in any qualitative
          differences in the results of subsequent analyses.
          For each orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> set of size <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          evolutionary distances between the sequences were
          calculated using 3BRANCH <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">program</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.I.W.</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> on request) that uses the
          distance correction based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution of
          site rate variation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>] with an α parameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylogenetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> lengths were calculated from
          distances by solving the following set of equations
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>):
          distance from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> A to species B (dAB) = branch
          length A (bA) + bB,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dAC</ENAMEX> = bA + bC,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dBC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">bB</NUMEX> + bC.
          For example, solving for bA yields bA = (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dAB</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dAC</NUMEX> -
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dBC</ENAMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/2</TIMEX>.
          For each orthologous gene set, pairwise estimates of
          the synonymous (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) and non-synonymous (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          a ) substitution rates were obtained
          from nucleotide-coding sequence alignments using the
          Pamilo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bianchi-Li</ENAMEX> method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35</TIMEX>] implemented in the
          PBLtest program (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.B.R.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data, available from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> on request). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pairwise</ENAMEX> estimates were averaged
          to obtain the data presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          Domain architectures of the functionally diversified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were assessed by using the SMART server [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX>'s CD-Search server [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 38</TIMEX>]. Domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">architectures</ENAMEX> together with the results of PSI-BLAST [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>] searches that were run for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three iterations</TIMEX>, Entrez
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein annotation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>] and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">annotations</ENAMEX> in the
          COG database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 40</ENAMEX>], were used to assign (probable)
          functions to the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The phyletic
          distribution of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was determined from the
          PSI-BLAST search results using the TAX_COLLECTOR program
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEALS</ENAMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. Additional case-by-case
          inspection of these results was conducted and
          neighbor-joining phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 43</TIMEX>] were
          constructed to verify the orthologous relationships
          between the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This was done by ensuring
          that putative orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> did not show a greater
          similarity to any paralogs or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from more distant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> than they did to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> included in the
          analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>. As a result of this inspection, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyrococcus COGs</ENAMEX> were removed from
          the original set of selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> set, the standard error of the
          predicted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -value for each 
          x -value in the regression (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) was determined. The number of standard errors away
          from the linear trend line that corresponds to an
          expectation value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was calculated using the
          inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution
          for a probability equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> - (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.05/number</NUMEX> of values in
