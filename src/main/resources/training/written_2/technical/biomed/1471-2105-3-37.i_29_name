        Genomic cloning has revealed that most of the enzyme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> essential for maintaining cell growth have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> throughout evolution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . However, mammalian
        enzymes with different functional activity may have evolved
        by combining elements from several bacterial ancestral
        genes. Even small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may contain several individual
        domains that link them to different superfamilies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        While many endonucleases share a common active site that is
        highly conserved across many subfamilies, identifying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that control substrate specificity requires
        sophisticated analysis that combines both sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> and structural data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        In this paper we distinguish, using a word-based
        "molego" approach, structural elements that control
        substrate specificity. We postulate here that elements
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of related protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        dictate common structures and also common "functions",
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, individual steps in a complex reaction. Areas that
        affect substrate specificity will be less conserved in the
        superfamily than they are in subfamilies of enzymes that
        catalyze specific activities. We have chosen to illustrate
        this approach using the multifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of DNA
        repair <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apurinic</ENAMEX>/apyrimidinic endonucleases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX>), which have a clearly defined bacterial ancestor, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> exonuclease <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExoIII</ENAMEX>), and
        are distantly related to several enzymes with varying
        substrate specificity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX> are essential for mammalian cell growth and
        bacterial survival in the presence of ionizing radiation
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA mutagens</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . They initiate repair of an abasic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> site by cleaving the phosphodiester backbone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphodeoxyribose</ENAMEX>. This generates the necessary 3'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol β</ENAMEX>, δ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ε</NUMEX>, in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>) to insert the correct nucleotide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> steps
        in the base excision repair pathway (BER-pathway) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Recent crystal structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">huAPE1</ENAMEX> complexed with DNA
        containing an abasic site [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] , combined with
        sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, have
        defined the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that participate in metal ion based
        cleavage of the phosphate backbone of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        Mutations that greatly diminish the enzymatic activity
        of huAPE1 do not affect, and may even increase binding to
        damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, while non-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding remains low [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 18</NUMEX> ] . Further, mutations that have little effect on APE
        activity in vitro prevent complementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair
        deficient 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> . As seen with other DNA
        repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , specificity determining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>,
        as yet unidentified for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX>, must be distinct from those
        involved in phosphorolysis.
        To better assess which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> determine specificity,
        we assume that functions unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX> will be determined
        by motifs that are not conserved in a similar fashion in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with a different activity spectrum of functions.
        Besides cleaving the phosphate backbone, to achieve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificity APEs</ENAMEX> must coordinate a series of functions,
        including: interaction with target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a series of
        small, possibly repetitive steps (scanning), locating
        damage sites, establishing the transition state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        completing the cleavage, re-adjusting the charge status
        within the active site, and regulating release of product
        after interaction with the next enzyme in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BER</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . A finer breakdown of these functions
        can be achieved at the molecular level once all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the reaction mechanism are known. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX> also
        have RNase H, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-exonuclease, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-phosphodiester
        activities that are particularly high in the bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 13</NUMEX> ] .
        Our web-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MASIA</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] was used to rapidly
        decompose the sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX> and related protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> into motifs, areas of significant conservation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of identical function, which could then be
        correlated structurally using data from crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        Having determined that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> motifs were common to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE1's</ENAMEX>,
        we compared the structure of the subset of these that
        occurred in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> and synaptojanin, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. These shared motifs had a similar 3D structure
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of these functionally diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>,
        and we therefore called these motifs "molegos" (molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legos</ENAMEX>). We then demonstrated that the shared molegos served
        a similar role in substrate binding by comparing the DNA
        binding profile of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">huAPE1</TIMEX> with that for the less specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>. The molegos present in both enzymes
        interact with target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a similar fashion, while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in molegos distinctive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APE1</TIMEX> control
        specificity by binding primarily to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apurinic</ENAMEX> site. Matching of molegos, guided by the degree of
        conservation of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> across the three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, allowed a better alignment of the individual
        secondary structure elements among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DALI</ENAMEX>
        achieved. This word based, sequence (motif) to structure
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">molego</NUMEX>) to function method has clear implications for
        genomic analysis and template based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> modeling, as
        well as immediate application in recognizing specificity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">determinants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that share active sites common to
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Total sequence decomposition of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ape1</ENAMEX> with
          MASIA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MASIA</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> motifs as conserved in all members
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and Table 1</ENAMEX>). As table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, last
          column, illustrates, these motifs include all the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> known to be essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA cleavage</ENAMEX>. Most of
          the highly conserved (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> have
          been shown by previous mutagenesis studies to affect
          activity. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> motifs are also structurally conserved,
          as demonstrated by the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> values between segments
          in the crystal structures of bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ExoIII</ENAMEX> and of
          huAPE1. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 26%</NUMEX> identical (based
          on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DALI</ENAMEX>, structure based alignment) and most of the
          similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> are contained in the molegos. As the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> column of the table demonstrates, the backbone
          deviation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> is overall <<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Å</NUMEX> and for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of
          the motifs, <<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Å</NUMEX>. We have chosen the name "molegos"
          for the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> associated with motifs, which
          are presented pictorially in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>. Most of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and metal ion binding molegos form individual
          β-strands at the core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that orient the
          absolutely conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> toward the substrate, but
          several have a helical or hydrogen bonded coil
          structure.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> motifs, which account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, are bridged by areas that vary in the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. These connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> may
          account for the differing activities of the bacterial and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mammalian proteins</ENAMEX>. The longest molego, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, was broken
          down into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas, with the contiguous region labeled
          7a. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7a</NUMEX> area molego are quite
          similar in the bacterial and mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX>. However, the
          end is differently conserved in eukaryotes. The
          endonuclease activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is reduced many fold by
          integrating this loop from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> exonuclease <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, but the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> cleaves at abasic sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with low efficiency
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Thus additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX> control
          specificity while still allowing a reasonable rate of
          phosphorolytic cleavage.
        
        
          Finding APE molegos in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> 1
          superfamily
          In an effort to functionally annotate the molegos of
          APE1, we next sought to find them in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> some structural similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNase-1</ENAMEX> and inositol <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-polyphosphate phosphatases (IPP)
          have been grouped according to the SCOP database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
          as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DNase-1</ENAMEX> like superfamily. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase 1</ENAMEX> has
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 18%</NUMEX> overall sequence identity and the IPP domain of
          synaptojanin, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>, to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APE1</TIMEX>, we could show that most of
          the areas of identity were in molegos common to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Motifs in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were
          identified by genomic cross-networking with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIBLAST</ENAMEX> (see
          methods for details). Our analysis identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> molegos
          that are common to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase 1, IPP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>,
          which roughly correspond to areas of sequence similarity
          identified previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . The structural
          similarities of molegos <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 11 and 12</TIMEX> (i.e., the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">segmental RMSD</ENAMEX>'s) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between APE1</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the
          distantly related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are comparable
          to those found between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (Figure
          4and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1& 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Common molegos form a similar active site in two
          distant relatives
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> conserved molegos form the β-barrel core of
          huAPE1. The completely conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of huAPE1
          concentrate, for the most part, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end of this</TIMEX>
          framework to form the metal ion binding active site
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This core is also common to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synaptojanin</ENAMEX>(an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPP</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>), which share the
          functions of metal ion based cleavage of a phosphate
          backbone. The shared molegos define an active site
          architecture conserved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including
          the orientation of the substrate toward the metal binding
          site.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Molegos</ENAMEX> define functional areas common to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> 1
          and APE1
          A contact plot of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">huAPE1</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the 1DE8
          crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) shows that motifs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-12</NUMEX> all have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> close to the substrate, an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> containing an abasic site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal motifs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> bind primarily <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apurinic</ENAMEX> site and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the undamaged strand.
          The other motifs bind more to the area <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' of the damage
          site. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motifs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 and 12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> both strands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">motif 12</ENAMEX> contains several highly conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that, according to mutagenesis results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>)
          contribute to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APE1</TIMEX> activity, only His309 is very close to
          the abasic site in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Molegos <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 9</NUMEX> contain no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal ion</ENAMEX>. Comparing
          the binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> in a substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>,
          left) suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX>'s binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> after cleavage (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), especially that mediated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">molego 3</ENAMEX>, is stronger, while the distance from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA 3</ENAMEX>' of the cleavage site increases.
          The contact plots of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APE1 and DNase1</TIMEX> with their
          respective substrates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) documents that the
          similar molegos in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> serve similar functions.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including
          molegos <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>, bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' of the cleavage site and to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the opposite DNA strand. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Molegos 7</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 and 12</TIMEX>
          bind to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' and the next base 3' of the cleavage
          site in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Overall, the pattern of protein
          contacts to the cleavage site, the area <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> site, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' end of the opposite strand are
          common to both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the functions of
          forming the substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and the actual
          phosphorolysis are similar in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          While the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in both cases is similar,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> clearly has less binding to bases opposite and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          of the cleavage site. The extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> that APE1
          makes to these positions are mediated by molegos it does
          not share with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Molegos 6, 7a and 10</TIMEX> all have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> within hydrogen bonding distance of the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">basepairs 3</ENAMEX>' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-site. This redundancy of binding
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' side is unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX>, as is its strong binding
          to the DNA opposite the abasic site.
          The importance of such bonds for activity was shown in
          other work, where <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">huAPE1</TIMEX>'s binding to the DNA backbone is
          only inhibited by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ethylation of the phosphates two and</TIMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>' to an abasic site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Mutation of
          R177A, at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6</ENAMEX>, that binds to this region
          and to the bases opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX>-site had enhanced
          activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , while mutations at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">W280</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Molego 11</NUMEX>) and
          F266 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Molego 10</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] reduce activity and, in the
          latter case, substrate selectivity.
          In work from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that will be described
          separately, we used this analysis to generate mutants of
          APE1 with altered activity. An alanine substitution
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N226A</TIMEX>, of a conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">molego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7a</ENAMEX> that forms a hydrogen bond with the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> downstream of the abasic site, had
          enhanced APE activity but increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Km</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kd</ENAMEX> values,
          similar to an alanine mutant of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R177</TIMEX>, which binds to the
          same site, reported previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . A combination of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mutants, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N226A and R177A</TIMEX>, substantially reduced
          the ability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">APE1</NUMEX> to bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> containing an abasic
          site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izumi et al.</ENAMEX>, in preparation). Thus, molegos can
          effectively guide the redesign of enzymes to alter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molegos</ENAMEX> to improve structural alignment
          Using molegos may also help in aligning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> based modeling, by determining the end points of
          secondary structure elements in alignments with many gaps
          and insertions. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MASIA</ENAMEX> analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K/R and DI</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-termini of motifs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> are
          absolutely conserved in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX>, DNase1s
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPPs</ENAMEX>. However, matching these conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          between synaptojanin and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DNase1</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">APE</ENAMEX> requires a gapping
          that would not be consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTALW</ENAMEX> or a
          structural (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DALI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] ) alignment of these proteins
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). If the local alignment with synaptojanin is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gapped</ENAMEX> to align these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> proteins
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, gapped), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMSD</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sections
          separated by the gap is much lower than that if one tries
          to align the whole ungapped segment. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          7illustrates, the local environments of both conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue pairs DI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QE</ENAMEX> are structurally equivalent in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, indicating that a motif based
          alignment with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> residue gap is correct. The first
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> β-strand molegos in synaptojanin are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          longer than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DNase 1</NUMEX>. By regarding these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> as simple lego style blocks, and recognizing the
          connectivity, molego based alignment correctly defined
          the changing length of the secondary structure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Is the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> determined by binding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'
          to an abasic site?
          Crystal structure data, coupled with molego analysis,
          outlined the areas of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APE1</TIMEX> that distinguish its mode of
          DNA binding from the less specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>. Contact maps
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) illustrate how the conserved motifs direct DNA
          binding in the distributive (i.e., rapidly releasing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">substrate/</ENAMEX>product), relatively non-specific DNase1 as
          opposed to the processive, highly specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">huAPE1</TIMEX>. Both
          enzymes cleave only one DNA strand in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bacterial Xth</ENAMEX> cleaves ssDNA containing an abasic site [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . The additional contacts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">huAPE1</TIMEX>, compared to DNase
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' to the damage site and to the
          opposite strand lower its turnover rate and its potential
          to cleave normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> contacting the region
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' to the abasic site come from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different uniquely
          conserved areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX> (molegos <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6,7a</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>,
          a molego that is similar to that in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNase-1</ENAMEX>. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX>, coupled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ethylation data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] ,
          indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' binding is a key element in specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX>.
          This is confirmed by site directed mutagenesis
          studies. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> protein areas that bind to the DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' of the abasic site, mutating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F266</TIMEX> (molego <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) or W280
          (middle of molego <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) decreases APE activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The
          F266 mutation is particularly interesting, as the mutants
          at this position had reduced substrate specificity and
          enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>'-exonuclease activity. However, an R177A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutant</ENAMEX> had 
          enhanced APE activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ,
          as do mutations at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N226</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izumi et al.</ENAMEX>, in preparation).
          Combining these mutations however greatly decreases
          substrate binding (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izumi et al.</ENAMEX>, in preparation). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] and the wide area covered by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> on both sides of the abasic site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] are
          both consistent with the need to hold the product until
          the correct polymerase moves in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX>' to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' to complete the
          repair [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . This implies that the mammalian enzyme
          has evolved to be processive, to facilitate more
          efficient functioning of the overall BER pathway, and may
          not be optimized for simple catalysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Processivity</ENAMEX> is an
          important facit of the activity of enzymes that function
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Reduced processivity may
          explain, for example, the repair deficits in Xeroderma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pigmentosum</ENAMEX> (XPA) cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Our molego approach
          provides a basis for exploring the role of segments of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in its functions, rather than relying only on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from missense mutations.
        
        
          Using molegos to detect structural and functional
          homologues
          We have demonstrated here the derivation and uses of
          molegos for analyzing the specificity of enzymes, based
          on those derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The methodology can
          be used to complement searches with programs such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIBLAST</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROSITE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] to detect distantly related
          functional or structural homologues in sequences revealed
          by genome sequencing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIBLAST</ENAMEX> searches often reveal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of local similarity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have no
          significant overall sequence identity. Molego analysis
          could be useful to analyze the significance of such
          findings. The combined sequence and structure definition
          makes molegos more flexible for defining shared protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> than methods such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROSITE</ENAMEX> that require a
          strict one-dimensional definition. An improved motif
          definition method, based on physical property similarity
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] , which has been incorporated into our MASIA tool]
          also promises to enhance the usefulness of the method.
          This may eventually lead to a method to find functional
          relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with even lower overall
          sequence similarity.
          Another potential area for applying the molego
          approach is in homology modeling. Molegos may prove
          useful in to check alignments for template based modeling
          of homologues with low identity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and</ENAMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), if
          the "anchoring" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are conserved in sequence or
          property across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of both subfamilies. Our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">molego</ENAMEX> approach is closest in principle to that of the
          ROSETTA program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] whereby the latter seeks only to
          connect structure, not function, to a sequence element.
          We are currently testing the usefulness of the molego
          approach in modeling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CASP5</TIMEX> competition.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The MASIA program can parse sequences into discrete
        blocks of significant conservation. The motifs identified
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> could be structurally annotated using
        crystal data to derive molegos, words in the protein
        sequence that correlate with structural elements. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">molegos</ENAMEX> could in turn be functionally annotated by
        comparing the DNA binding profile of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APE1</TIMEX> with that of the
        less specific nuclease <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNase 1</ENAMEX>. This analysis indicated
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues binding 3</ENAMEX>' to the site of phosphorolytic
        cleavage control the substrate specificity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">APE1</TIMEX>. These
        results indicate that molegos can provide a useful basis
        for identifying specificity determining regions in enzymes
        with similar active sites but different activity spectra [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 28 3</NUMEX> ] . Site directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutagenesis</ENAMEX> based on these
        results can define the function of the unique elements of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APEs</ENAMEX>, and aid in the design of enzymes with altered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">converge</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 iterations</TIMEX>, but few new sequences were
          added in the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. Searches with an e-value of
          0.01/iteration had similar results, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were not included until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> cycles.

          alignment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of a protein
          family was prepared and analyzed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MASIA</ENAMEX> for
          significant areas of conservation. In some cases,
          alignments taken from literature references (e.g., for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ) were used to confirm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MASIA</ENAMEX> results. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motifs</ENAMEX> common to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were compared with the
          APE motifs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Criteria for inclusion (presence
          of motif) included conservation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> (side chains shown in blue in the tables) and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' contributions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHS</ENAMEX> developed the molego concept, performed the sequence
        analysis and prepared the manuscript. NO analyzed the
        structural properties of the molegos, and prepared figures
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> prepared mutants of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APE1 protein</ENAMEX>
        to test the conclusions of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, and he provided
        background and list of mutations affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> function. WB
        designed and developed the MASIA program and the modular
        analysis approach to enzyme functions.

        Sequence alignment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MASIA</ENAMEX> printout for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APE</ENAMEX> family The original alignment used for the APE
        family and the MASIA consensus macro output. Note that the 
        A. thaliana sequence is consistently
        an outlier in the file, due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLUSTAL-W</ENAMEX> misalignment
        of the nuclease area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is not removed. The real position of the motifs in
        the 
        A. thaliana sequence are
        underlined.
