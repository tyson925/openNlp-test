        Cells of the innate immune system sense host invasion by
        detecting structural determinants that are broadly
        conserved among pathogens of a given phylogenetic group [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. The lipopolysaccharides (LPS or endotoxin) that
        decorate the outer membrane of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are
        excellent examples of such determinants. In response to
        minute concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LPS</ENAMEX> derived from certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, macrophages secrete cytokines such
        as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">interleukin-1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL-1</ENAMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-6</ENAMEX>, which contribute to the containment of infection and
        help to initiate a specific immune response. On the other
        hand, overstimulation of the innate immune system through
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> can lead to acute systemic inflammation and
        shock [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>].
        Dramatic differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> responses are apparent
        between closely related species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and there are
        substantial differences even among genetically
        heterogeneous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same species [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. For
        example, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX> are generally
        considered to be very sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], baboons and
        most other primates are highly resistant. It is likely that
        part of the difference in sensitivity may be explained at a
        very proximal level, although differences in responses to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> (for example TNF) may also have a role. Neither
        interspecific differences nor interindividual differences
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> responses have, until recently, been accessible to
        systematic genetic analysis. Advances in understanding LPS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> transduction now permit these issues to be
        examined.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> was once thought to exert its effects
        through intercalation into biological membranes, or to bind
        to many different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> on the cell surface, it has
        been clear for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly three decades</TIMEX> that there is, in fact,
        a single biochemical pathway for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> detection. This was
        indicated by the observation that allelic [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] mutations of
        a single gene ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lps</ENAMEX> ) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> could entirely abrogate
        the response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, and did so with great specificity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> C3H<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/HeJ</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/10ScCr</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] are
        highly resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, showing none of the usual
        biological effects, yet respond normally to other bacterial
        products and to most cytokines induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        We recently identified the 
        Lps locus through positional cloning
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and showed that the LPS-resistance phenotype was
        caused by defects in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toll</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor 4 gene</ENAMEX> ( 
        Tlr4 ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C3H</TIMEX>/HeJ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, a
        point mutation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P712H</TIMEX>; single-letter amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid notation</ENAMEX>)
        modifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> within the cytoplasmic domain,
        creating a codominant inhibitory effect on LPS signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/10</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ScCr mice</ENAMEX> the gene is deleted,
        yielding a recessive abolition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> response.
        Subsequently, overexpression of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tlr4 protein</ENAMEX>
        was found to enhance LPS signal transduction in wild-type
        macrophages, lowering the effective concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>, whereas
        overexpression of the Tlr4 Lps-disoform represented in
        C3H/HeJ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> almost completely suppresses signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        Furthermore, genetic complementation studies have
        demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tlr4</ENAMEX> enter into close physical
        proximity in the course of signal transduction - Tlr4
        appears to bind directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>. Hence, the species origin
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tlr4</ENAMEX> is the sole determinant of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> preference for a
        given LPS structure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/10</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ScCr strains</ENAMEX> are
        abnormally susceptible to infection by certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, suggesting that timely recognition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> is essential for successful containment of infection
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Because deleterious mutations of 
        Tlr4 have become fixed spontaneously
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, we considered it possible that
        other functionally important mutations might be identified
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Moreover, information on the degree of 
        Tlr4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> in these and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> might allow inferences about the importance of
        different Tlr4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, we decided to sequence
        the entire Tlr4 gene of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and to survey
        genetic variation at the locus in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. We also
        examined the 
        TLR4 sequence from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of
        subhuman primates that have dramatically different
        responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Overall structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TLR4sand</ENAMEX> Tlr4
          The mouse 
          Tlr4 gene is somewhat longer than
          its human counterpart 
          TLR4 , owing to the greater length
          of intronic sequence - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,337</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX>) from
          beginning to end of the transcribed sequence in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11,467 bp</NUMEX> in the human. There are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> exons in 
          Tlr4, and each corresponds to a
          homologous sequence in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>. Rock 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] reported a human cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U88880</NUMEX>) that includes
          a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> exon, positioned between the 'normal' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> introns. When included in the processed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transcript</ENAMEX>, however, this exon specifies early
          termination of the polypeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. Although it is
          possible that translation is initiated distal to the
          added stop codon, and that a shorter product results in
          the human than in the mouse, this would be unusual, given
          the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' untranslated region (UTR) that would
          then exist and the presence of multiple upstream
          initiation codons. Moreover, there is no murine sequence
          homologous to the alternative <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> exon of the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. The biological significance of this exon is
          therefore unclear and, in all likelihood, its inclusion
          in the mRNA leads to the formation of a nonfunctional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          Neither the human nor the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TATA</ENAMEX>
          element or CAAT <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> in the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> region. A
          number of conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and enhancer motifs are
          apparent on alignment of the murine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human 5</ENAMEX>' flanking
          sequences, and are described in detail elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
          Both 
          Tlr4 and 
          TLR4 lie amid repetitive sequences
          of retroviral origin, and no other genes are detected
          close to either of them using homology searches or the
          gene prediction <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algorithm GRAIL</ENAMEX>. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the
          grayscale images of the human and mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> call
          attention to the repetitive elements in the region and
          illustrate the relationship between exons and spacing in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Genetic variation at the mouse Tlr4locus
          Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> strains of 
          Mus musculus , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different alleles
          were identified on the basis of mutations at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> sites
          with respect to the reference sequence. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          create amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid substitutions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          most common murine allele was represented at a frequency
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 69%</NUMEX>. The ancestry of different 
          Tlr4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> can be traced by
          haplotype analysis, as many deviations from the reference
          allele occur in conjunction with one another. A plausible
          arrangement of strain relationships is presented in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Some strains have accumulated many more
          mutations than others. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P/J</ENAMEX> strain 
          Tlr4 gene exhibits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> mutations the
          distinguish it from the most common haplotype, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of
          them specifying changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Tlr4</TIMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequence</ENAMEX>;
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEA/GnJ</ENAMEX> strain differs by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> mutations, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">strains NZW/J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VM/Dk</ENAMEX>, which are identical to one
          another, differ from the most common haplotype at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
          sites. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shared</ENAMEX> mutations suggest that introgression took
          place after mutational separation had occurred, leading
          to the introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of mutations by genetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>. Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P/J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NZW/J</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">VM</ENAMEX>/Dk
          strains have several mutations that are observed in the
          A<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BALB</ENAMEX>/c strains, but also lack some of the
          mutations of the latter strains and have unique mutations
          of their own.
          Most of the murine mutations reside within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 3</TIMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substitutions</ENAMEX> are noted that modify the
          cytoplasmic domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.) Of these, however, one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R761H</NUMEX>) is fairly common among the strains
          surveyed, and the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> has been reported
          as an H in the hamster. A single conservative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">substitution</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">V637I</NUMEX>) was noted within the transmembrane
          domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P/J</ENAMEX> strain.
        
        
          Anthropoid ape and lower primate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TLR4sequences</TIMEX>, and
          their relationship to the human and rodent
          sequences
          The human and chimpanzee amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequences</ENAMEX> are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly</NUMEX> identical over the interval studied, distinguished
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> substitutions. The baboon sequence is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93.5%</NUMEX>
          identical to the human in the extracellular domain,
          differs in the transmembrane domain by one substitution
          out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, and differs in the proximal
          cytoplasmic domain by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">155</TIMEX>. At the
          carboxyl terminus, however, homology is badly disrupted,
          so that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are not
          replicated in the baboon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          shorter than the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Similarly, among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>,
          the carboxyl terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is the least
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. Overall, the order of conservation with
          respect to domain is: proximal cytoplasmic domain >
          transmembrane domain > extracellular domain >
          distal cytoplasmic domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The pathway by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> activates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> innate immune
        defenses has been illuminated by the positional cloning of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lps</ENAMEX> and establishment of its identity
        with 
        Tlr4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], a mammalian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] that
        serve both developmental and defensive functions. The
        function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tlr4</TIMEX> as the LPS signal transducer became clear
        when mapping [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and sequencing [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] data revealed 
        Tlr4 as the only gene in a critical
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.6 megabase</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>) region and, furthermore, showed that two
        strains of LPS-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are homozygous for mutations
        of 
        Tlr4 that are absent in closely
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>-sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>.
        In 
        Drosophila , the prototypic homolog
        of the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Toll</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toll</ENAMEX>) defends against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fungal</ENAMEX> infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], whereas the protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-wheeler
        defends against bacterial infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. In the case of
        Toll, there is no evidence of direct contact between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and the microbial pathogen or its components.
        Rather, infection activates a proteolytic cascade that
        leads to the production of an endogenous ligand (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SpÃ¤tzle</ENAMEX>),
        which in turn engages Toll. The situation is apparently
        different in mammals, in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tlr4</TIMEX> is clearly a direct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> with the microbial world. As such, the primary
        structure of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Tlr4</NUMEX> molecule determines ligand specificity
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], accounting for the well-known observation that mouse
        cells can recognize tetra-acyl lipid A as an agonist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]
        whereas human cells recognize it as an antagonist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24</TIMEX>].
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX> strain are highly susceptible to
        infection by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, it would seem
        plausible that among human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sepsis</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may have been at risk by virtue of
        mutations in 
        TLR4 . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in determining
        whether different isoforms of Tlr4 confer added risk of, or
        protection against, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> is the assessment of genetic
        variability at this locus in the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        Whereas ablative mutations of 
        Tlr4 abolish the capacity to detect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, the question arises as to whether less severe mutation
        might alter either the specificity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> detection, as
        discussed above, or the magnitude of the LPS signal. Our
        present knowledge of Tlr4 structural variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> may
        permit an answer to this question, insofar as the mutations
        might easily be recreated, and measurements of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>-transducing activity through the modified receptors
        carried out in immortalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C3H/HeJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P/J</ENAMEX> strains have defective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumoricidal</ENAMEX> capacity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27, 28, 29</TIMEX>], although in
        neither case is the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lps</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locus</ENAMEX> implicated in the
        defect.
        Deleterious mutations of 
        TLR4 might reasonably be sought in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who have developed serious Gram-negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, on the premise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with deleterious
        mutations of 
        Tlr4 are rendered susceptible to such
        infections. Similarly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, a polymorphism at the 
        tenascin locus (which lies a few
        megabases proximal to 
        Tlr4 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>) predicts susceptibility
        to Gram-negative infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>], suggesting that it may
        lie in linkage disequilibrium with a particular form of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">avian</ENAMEX> 
        Tlr4 gene. Beyond this, it may be
        assumed, given the powerful pro-inflammatory activity of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, that germline or somatic mutations of 
        TLR4 could in some instances cause
        constitutive signal transduction (as observed with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Drosophila Toll locus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]). such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> might, in principle, account for certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory diseases</ENAMEX>. In fact, in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lpr</ENAMEX> model of systemic lupus
        erythematosus, the 
        Lps locus was believed a likely
        modulator of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phenotype</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. This would seem still more
        likely at present, given the paucity of other candidate
        genes in the immediate vicinity of 
        Tlr4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        The evolutionary conservation of 
        Tlr4 is of particular interest, in
        that different species show preferential responses to some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> forms and not others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>], and have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particular 'set</ENAMEX> points' for responses to toxic LPS
        molecules. An assessment of variability may be made through
        comparison of different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but is complemented by the
        study of a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> within species. Both
        approaches reveal that the extracellular domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tlr4</ENAMEX> is
        highly variable compared with the transmembrane domain and
        proximal cytoplasmic domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Pooling the
        number of mutable sites in the extracellular domain and
        transmembrane domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> coding changes
        are observed, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in the proximal cytoplasmic
        domain. Moreover, variability does not seem confined to any
        particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the extracellular domain, but is
        spread uniformly across its length.
        The extracellular domain of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is concerned
        principally with ligand recognition. Given that the ligand
        is an endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, extracellular domain conservation
        tends to be strict, insofar as mutations affecting
        extracellular domain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> are likely to diminish
        specificity or affinity of binding. Hence, protein-binding
        receptors tend to be minimally polymorphic. The presumed
        ligand for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tlr4</TIMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> itself, presented alone or in
        conjunction with another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (for example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD14</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>],
        and the relatively high frequency of polymorphism observed
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tlr4</TIMEX> may be viewed as a consequence of the protective
        effect rendered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> recognition and the variability of
        LPS structure.
        The cytoplasmic domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tlr4</ENAMEX> is far more stringently
        conserved than the extracellular domain. This is probably
        due to the fact that the cytoplasmic domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tlr4</ENAMEX> is not
        required to cope with a ligand of variable structure.
        Rather, when called upon to signal, it must do so,
        utilizing transducing molecules with conserved structures.
        On the other hand, the intensity of the LPS signal has
        apparently been optimized for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>], perhaps
        ensuring that the response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX> is appropriately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> into the immune response as a whole. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ungulates</ENAMEX> and rabbits, for example, exhibit an intense
        response to low concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPS</ENAMEX>, whereas the lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primates</ENAMEX> and most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> are relatively more resistant [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>]. The highly variable carboxy-terminal end of the Tlr4
        cytoplasmic domain may be seen as the embodiment of
        interspecific differences in LPS sensitivity, although the
        poor conservation of this portion of the molecule might
        alternatively be taken to indicate a neutral effect of
        mutation. It is also possible that this region of the
        molecule is subject to a higher rate of mutation than that
        applying to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Although most such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> might be removed by selection, some might be
        discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> defined by the occurrence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>.

          Determination of the complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Tlr4</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TLR4</NUMEX>) genomic sequences
          The mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) 152C16
          (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 129/J</TIMEX> strain, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Genetics</ENAMEX>) was previously
          shown by us to contain the 
          Tlr4 gene in its entirety [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>],
          and a small fraction of 
          Tlr4 was also found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overlapping BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">309I17</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> 
          TLR4 was identified in BAC 110P15
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Systems</ENAMEX>) by hybridization screening using a
          PCR-amplified human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TLR4</ENAMEX> cDNA sequence as a probe. All
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> were fragmented by ultrasound, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> cloned
          into the vector pBluescript-KS, and extensively sequenced
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">373</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">377</NUMEX> sequencers, using Big Dye
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminators</ENAMEX>; 959 reads were obtained from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">390I17, 1503</TIMEX>
          reads from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">110P15</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2731</TIMEX> reads from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">152C16</TIMEX>. The
          average read length was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 700</NUMEX> nucleotides. To
          concentrate data acquisition efforts on the 
          Tlr4 and 
          TLR4 genes themselves, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers
          were fashioned to match regions flanking each gene. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          kb fragment was amplified from the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">152C16</ENAMEX>, and
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> kb fragment was amplified from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAC 110P15</ENAMEX>,
          each containing all exons of the respective gene. These
          fragments were also shotgun cloned and extensively
          sequenced, so that the depth of sequence reached an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> reads over the area of greatest interest.
          Sequence assembly used the programs phred and Phrap
          (obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Ewing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Green</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Genome Center</ENAMEX>). Interpretation of repetitive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> was achieved with the program RepeatMasker
          (obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arian Smit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Center</ENAMEX>). A contiguous high-quality sequence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,974</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bp</ENAMEX> in length, containing 
          TLR4 , was obtained from the human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>, and a contig <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">91,748 bp</NUMEX> in length, containing 
          Tlr4 , was obtained from the mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these</TIMEX> intervals, the error rate was estimated
          at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 4bp</NUMEX>. These sequences have been posted to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> in annotated form (accession number <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF177767</TIMEX> for
          the murine sequence and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AF177765</ENAMEX> for the human sequence).
          All data related to mutations are presented with
          reference to these sequences.
        
        
          Sequencing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, chimpanzee and baboon
          samples
          Mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> 
          Mus musculus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, was ordered
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratories</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chimpanzee</ENAMEX> and baboon DNA
          were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Benirschke</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Delzoppo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps</ENAMEX>
          Research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>), respectively.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> principal exons of 
          Tlr4 were amplified independently
          from mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA samples</ENAMEX>, leaving a margin of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50 bp</NUMEX> to each side of the exons so as to
          indentify intronic mutations that might alter splicing.
          All exons of the chimpanzee were amplified and sequenced
          using the same primers used to amplify and sequence the
          human exons. For the baboon, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> were
          also amplified using these same primers; however, the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> exon of the baboon was amplified with a substituted
          primer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were isolated by agarose gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX>. Exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> were sequenced using the
          same primers that were used for amplification. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exon 3</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequenced</ENAMEX> using the flanking primers as well as a
          collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> internal primers. In this manner, the
          entire coding region and all splice junctions of 
          Tlr4 could be covered with a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequencing</ENAMEX> reads. All primers used for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> and sequencing are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>;
          separate sets were used to amplify and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sequence mouse</ENAMEX> and
          the primate samples.
          Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of each sample was required as a
          condition for further analysis, and if such assembly
          failed, additional reads were executed using a secondary
          collection of primers. Thereafter, mutations were
          identified 
          en masse, by pooling all of the
          reads from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 to 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> at a time and reassembling
          with the program polyphred, using the phred-PhrapPoly
          script (obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Natalie Kolker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Genome Center</ENAMEX>). Consed 
          - alpha (obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Gordon</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington Genome Center</ENAMEX>) was used to
          visualize reads and mutations.
          The annotated chimpanzee exon sequences have been
          submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> with the accession numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF179218</TIMEX>,
          AF179219 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF179220</TIMEX>. The baboon sequences have been
          submitted with the accession numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF180962</TIMEX>, AF180963
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AF180694</TIMEX>. For genetic comparisons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> (Genbank
          AF057025) and hamster (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF153676</NUMEX>) 
          Tlr4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were also used.
        
        
          Genetic computation
          A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz DEC</ENAMEX>-alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> equipped with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mbytes</ENAMEX> of
          memory was used for direct analysis of sequence data as
          described above. In addition to the programs already
          mentioned, the GCG software (version <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.0</NUMEX>) was used for
          alignment analysis, with the program Pileup used in
          multiple alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. The
          windows-based program <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Generunner 3.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hastings Software</ENAMEX>)
          was used for the design of oligonucleotide primers. A
          spline curve describing heterogeneity of the Tlr4
          polypeptide sequence from different species was produced
          using the program <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Prism 3.0</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphpad Software</ENAMEX>).
          Sequences were prepared for submission with the use of
          the program <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sequin 2.90</NUMEX> (obtained from the National
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biotechnological Information</ENAMEX>).
