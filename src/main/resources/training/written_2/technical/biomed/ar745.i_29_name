        Transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (TGF)-Î² is a dimeric protein
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 kDa</NUMEX> molecular weight, originally isolated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelets</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct mammalian
        isoforms, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TGF-Î²1, TGF-Î²2 and TGF-Î²3</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> being the
        most abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">isoform</ENAMEX>. Almost all cell types express TGF-Î²,
        but the highest level of expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² is in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">platelets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mature TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        identical peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, each containing 112 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
        linked via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disulfide</ENAMEX> bonds [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is
        synthesized as part of a large, latent protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        unable to bind to cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, with mature active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> produced by cleavage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is a mutifunctional cytokine that plays an
        important role in immunomodulation, inflammation and tissue
        repair [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Many studies have suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² could
        be a potential therapeutic reagent for the repair of soft
        tissue and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, and following ischemic injury. It may also
        have applications for the treatment of chronic inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrotic</ENAMEX> and autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In contrast,
        other studies have demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> can cause
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> and fibrosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . The potential use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> for the treatment of human disease thus remains
        controversial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> is a systemic, autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        It is characterized by a chronic, erosive inflammation of
        painful and debilitating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, with progressive
        degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and bone accompanied by
        proliferation of the synovium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
        remains incurable and, in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, difficult to
        treat. As a novel approach to therapy, we and other workers
        have focused on developing the methods for local transfer
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding therapeutic agents</ENAMEX> to the joint [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . This strategy also can be applied to the
        treatment of osteoarthritis and for aiding the repair of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and other intra-articular tissues.
        Since <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> has anti-inflammatory properties as well as
        being able to stimulate new matrix synthesis by
        chondrocytes, it represents a possible therapeutic agent
        with which to treat pathologies associated with rheumatoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> and osteoarthritis by local gene delivery. Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and ourselves have previously examined the effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene transfer on matrix synthesis in chondrocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, demonstrating a significant stimulation in the
        production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteoglycans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, we have
        demonstrated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene was able to overcome the
        inhibitory effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> on matrix metabolism in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> in culture [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        To examine the effect of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> on joint pathology, we
        used adenovirus-mediated intra-articular gene delivery to
        confer sustained, intra-articular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naÃ¯ve</ENAMEX> and arthritic rabbit knee joints. Intra-articular
        injection of adenoviral vector expressing human
        transforming growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Î²1</NUMEX> resulted in a high
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> accumulation in the synovial fluid.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Intra-articular TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression was anti-inflammatory,
        inhibiting white blood cells. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression
        also induced significant pathology in the rabbit knee as
        well as in the adjacent muscle, including stimulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosaminoglycan</ENAMEX> (GAG) release and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide synthesis</ENAMEX>,
        and enhancement of fibrogenesis and muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">edema</ENAMEX>. These
        results suggest that, although <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> may have
        anti-inflammatory effects, sustained expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        has adverse effects on joint pathology.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Vector construction
          The recombinant adenoviral vector used in the present
          study originates from replication-deficient type 5
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adenovirus</ENAMEX> lacking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E1 and E3</TIMEX> loci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> was inserted in place of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in the
          shuttle plasmid pAd-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lox</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , where expression is
          driven by the cytomegalovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
          The recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> virus was generated by
          Cre-Lox-driven recombination in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          Briefly, a confluent <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 cm 2dish</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cre 8</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) was split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five 6</NUMEX> cm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2dishes</TIMEX>. Transfection of
          these cells with pAd-Lox-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> was performed by
          the calcium phosphate precipitation method with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pAd-Lox</ENAMEX>-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> construct digested with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sfi I and 3 Î¼g Ïˆ5</ENAMEX> helper virus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
          The transfected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> cells were fed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> until there
          were visible plaques. The cells were harvested and
          exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of freeze/thaw. The recombinant
          virus was purified and amplified by infecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 10</NUMEX> cm
          dishes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cre</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> cells using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼l lysate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>
          virus was purified using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cesium chloride</ENAMEX> gradient
          ultracentrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154,000</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000 rpm</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Â°C</ENAMEX>, and then
          dialyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tris</ENAMEX>-buffered saline.
          The titer was determined by measuring the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at
          optical density <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm (OD 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">260 nm</TIMEX> ) using the formula: viral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">particles</ENAMEX> = OD 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">260 nm Ã— dilution / 9.09 Ã— 10 -13.</ENAMEX> The

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> and experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">white rabbits</ENAMEX>, weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-5 kg</NUMEX>, were
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myrtles Rabbitry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). To establish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (AIA),
          rabbits were sensitized to ovalbumin by intradermal
          injections of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mg ovalbumin emulsified in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund</ENAMEX>'s
          complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">adjuvant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthritis</ENAMEX> was initiated in both hind
          knees of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rabbits 3 weeks later</TIMEX> by the intra-articular
          injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mg ovalbumin dissolved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gey</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX>. The different adenoviral vectors were injected
          intra-articularly <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> after injection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Experimental protocol
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX>, adenoviral
          particles encoding either the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> or luciferase
          were suspended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gey</ENAMEX>'s saline and injected into
          the joint space of the knee through the patellar tendon.
          Different doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Ã— 10 7, 1 Ã— 10 8and 1 Ã— 10 9</ENAMEX>)
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> were injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intra</ENAMEX>-articularly into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rabbits per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for analysis of the effects of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> on naÃ¯ve joint pathology, and the treated rabbits
          were sacrificed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> postinfection to observe the
          dose-response effects. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> naÃ¯ve
          rabbits was injected with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Ã— 10 9viral</NUMEX> particles and
          sacrificed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 days</TIMEX> postinfection for long-term
          observation.
          There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbits used in the
          study. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rabbits was injected with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Ã— 10 8viral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">particles</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          rabbits was injected with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Ã— 10 9viral</NUMEX> particles. Each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit</ENAMEX> received the indicated dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> virus in one
          knee and the same amount of the adenoviral vector
          expressing luciferase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc</ENAMEX>) virus in the opposite knee
          as the control.
          To lavage the rabbit knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gey</ENAMEX>'s saline
          was injected into the joint space through the patellar
          tendon. After manipulation of the joint, the needle was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reinserted</ENAMEX> and the fluid was aspirated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leukocytes</ENAMEX> in
          recovered lavage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> were counted using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemocytometer</ENAMEX>. The levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> in conditioned media,
          lavage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> and sera were measured using an ELISA kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R & D Systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) as directed by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>. The levels of sulfated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGs</ENAMEX> in lavage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> were determined using a colorimetric dye-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,9</NUMEX>-dimethylmethylene blue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . The
          levels of total nitrite in lavage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> were measured
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nitric Oxide Assay</ENAMEX> kits (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calbiochem Â®; Biosciences</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
          Articular cartilage fragments shaved from the femoral
          condyles were placed into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuman-Tyell</ENAMEX> serum-free
          medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) to measure the rate of
          proteoglycan synthesis. The fragments were then incubated
          with 35SO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 2</NUMEX>-(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼Ci</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, and
          the media harvested and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>. Proteoglycans
          were extracted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> by incubation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>

          Histology
          For histological analyses, tissues harvested from
          dissected knees were first fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> formalin. The
          fixed tissues were imbedded in paraffin, sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three days after</TIMEX> injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>, the knees
          receiving the highest dose of virus became enlarged with
          a reduction in joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>. In addition, the muscles
          adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> showed signs of swelling and
          reduced movement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
          post-injection, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> were analyzed. The size of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> and the adjacent muscles increased
          dramatically both in naÃ¯ve rabbits (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5</NUMEX> Ã— contralateral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">knees,</ENAMEX> 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbits
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.25</NUMEX> Ã— contralateral knees, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> was also severely limited, with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.Luc contralateral knees moving freely at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180Â°</NUMEX>
          whereas the knees treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> virus could only
          move at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90-120Â°</NUMEX>. The limitation to joint movement was not
          due to the enlarged muscles since, when the muscles were
          cut away, the limitation of movement was still observed.
          In addition, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> were analyzed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 days</TIMEX> after
          viral injection, at a time when the muscle size returned
          to normal, the joint still could not move freely. The
          limitation to joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> could thus be due to
          possible synovial hyperplasia or effects on ligaments or
          cartilage metabolism.
          It is important to note that we did observe an
          increase in creatine kinase levels in the serum that
          would suggest muscle damage (data not shown). In contrast
          to the high-dose TGF-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, only a very mild effect
          was observed on the gross joint <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">receiving 1 Ã— 10 8viruses</ENAMEX> and no changes were observed in

          Effect of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> on cartilage metabolism
          To determine whether overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> had
          effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage metabolism</ENAMEX> in naÃ¯ve and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joints</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX> synthesis by articular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and GAGs
          released into synovial fluid as a result of proteoglycan
          breakdown were measured. The rabbit joints receiving
          Ad.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> had significant higher levels of GAG release,
          compared with the contralateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.Luc <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, in lavage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3, day 7 and day 17</TIMEX> for the naÃ¯ve rabbits
          and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,3C</ENAMEX>). GAG
          release levels correlated linearly with the levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> in lavage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.937</NUMEX>) in the naÃ¯ve rabbits. In
          addition, only the highest dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> was able to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stimulate GAG</ENAMEX> synthesis in the naÃ¯ve rabbit joints from
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7 and day 17</TIMEX>, but the stimulation was marginal. There
          was no statistically significant difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAG</ENAMEX>
          synthesis by the naÃ¯ve rabbits with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lower doses
          of viral injections and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbits (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,3F</ENAMEX>).
          Taken together, these results suggest that
          intra-articular expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> stimulated cartilage
          matrix degradation while having only a minor effect on
          the promotion of new matrix synthesis. This is in
          contrast to the results observed on matrix synthesis in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> in culture, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> was able to
          stimulate significant new matrix synthesis as well as
          overcome the suppressive effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> on matrix
          metabolism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 25</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Inhibition of white blood cell infiltration and
          elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> synthesis
          To determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression could inhibit
          the mild inflammation induced by intra-articular
          injection of high doses of adenovirus or the severe
          inflammation occurring in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the levels of
          white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood leukocytic infiltrate</ENAMEX> in the synovial lavage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> were determined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of naÃ¯ve rabbits receiving the highest dose
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">adenovirus</ENAMEX> had significantly lower levels of
          white blood cell infiltration in lavage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7 and day 17</TIMEX>. The white blood cell infiltration in
          the naÃ¯ve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> directly correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          expression levels in the lavage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.954</NUMEX>). In the AIA rabbit knee
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joints</ENAMEX>, there was a reduction in the infiltration at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and day 7</TIMEX> compared with the contralateral control
          Ad.Luc <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> having an
          anti-inflammatory effect. Surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression
          elevated nitrate levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> receiving high-dose
          injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">adenovirus</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 3, day 7</TIMEX> and day
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> for naÃ¯ve rabbits and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbits,
          compared with the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,4F</ENAMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nitrate</ENAMEX> levels also directly correlated with the levels
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> in lavage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.945</NUMEX>) for naÃ¯ve rabbits.
          These results suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is indeed
          anti-inflammatory in arthritic knees, but is able to
          induce production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> through an unknown
          mechanism.
        
        
          Histological analysis of the intra-articular
          effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          The naÃ¯ve and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbit knee joints receiving
          Ad.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.Luc were also examined by histology.
          There was significant fibroblast proliferation around the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myofibers</ENAMEX> in the naÃ¯ve rabbits joint receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>.
          There was also mild hyperplasia of the synovial lining,
          but without any evidence of inflammatory cells being
          observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A,5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). There were some inflammatory cells
          in the contralateral synovial lining, but no evidence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovitis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C,5<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). The synovium from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          virus treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> was highly fibrotic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 days</TIMEX> after
          viral injection, with evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteometroplasia</ENAMEX> found
          in the synovium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5E<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) but with no evidence of
          inflammation or angiogenesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5F).
          There was mild inflammation under the synovium in the
          contralateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5G,5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovium</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIA</ENAMEX> rabbits showed
          evidence of hyperproliferation with mild inflammation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5I<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>), compared with the contralateral control
          joints that had severe inflammation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5K,5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>). In the
          muscle tissue adjacent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, there
          was evidence of both fibroblast and myofibroblast
          proliferation between myofibers with intracellular edema,
          but there was no evidence of inflammation or myonecrosis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5M,5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>). In contrast, the muscle tissue from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contralateral</ENAMEX> controls knees was normal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5O,5<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>).
          There was also mild fibroblast proliferation and synovial
          inflammation in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Ã— 10 8Ad</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but no
          significant histological changes were observed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Ã—
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 7viral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          These data taken together suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is able
          to stimulate fibrogenesis and to suppress inflammation.
          Moreover, the results suggest that elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> levels
          result in chondrogenesis within the synovial tissue.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is a mutifunctional cytokine that plays an
        important role in immunomodulation, inflammation and tissue
        repair. Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is able to induce new matrix
        synthesis from chondrocytes in culture as well as able to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> inflammation 
        in vivo , it has been proposed that
        local intra-articular gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> could be
        therapeutic for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> as
        well as osteoarthritis. To examine the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> on
        joint pathology, we used adenovirus-mediated
        intra-articular gene delivery to confer sustained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">intra-articular TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression in both naÃ¯ve and
        arthritic rabbit knee joints. Intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">articular</ENAMEX> injection of
        Ad.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> virus into the rabbit knee resulted in
        dose-dependent elevated levels of expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> in
        the synovial fluid, but not in the serum.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Intra-articular TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression resulted in
        dose-dependent biological effects in the rabbit knee as
        well as in adjacent muscle. In particular, local
        intra-articular expression in naÃ¯ve joints stimulated
        cartilage breakdown, as measured by synovial GAG levels,
        without enhancing new matrix synthesis. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        expression stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> production. Similarly,
        in arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TGF-Î²1 expression</ENAMEX> inhibited white
        blood cell infiltration, it also stimulated GAG release and
        nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide</ENAMEX> production. Although there was a reduction in
        inflammation in arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibrogenesis</ENAMEX> and muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">edema</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        expression in the adenovirally infected synovial lining
        also resulted in induction of chondrogenesis in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovium</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Elevated TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression in the synovial fluid
        thus resulted in a variety of adverse pathological
        changes.
        A previous study examined the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> in the
        knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> of naÃ¯ve <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57/Bl/6</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> where gene transfer of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to the mouse knee resulted in hyperplasia of the
        synovium as well as in chondro-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteophyte</ENAMEX> formation at the
        chondrosynovial junctions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The present experiments
        have shown similar effects on synovial proliferation, but
        also have extended the murine studies to examine the
        effects of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">TGF-Î²1</NUMEX> in both diseased knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> and normal
        knee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> in the rabbit. Similar to the previous report,
        we have observed evidence for intra-synovial chondrogenesis
        as well as osteometroplasia following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">TGF-Î²</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene transfer.
        Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> directly or indirectly stimulates
        proliferation of synovium is unclear, but this pathology
        apparently is mediated through an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Î²</ENAMEX>-independent
        mechanism.
        It has been speculated that intra-articular delivery of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> would result in enhanced synthesis of new matrix [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
        ] . Indeed, we have reported previously that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> is more effective than insulin-like growth factor type
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone morphogenetic protein</ENAMEX> type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in
        stimulating new matrix synthesis from rabbit chondrocytes
        in culture. We have also demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is able
        to partially overcome the inhibition of new matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">synthesis by IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> in cultured chondrocytes. The results
        presented in the present article, however, suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression is unable to enhance new matrix synthesis
        
        in vivo in either naÃ¯ve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> or, in
        particular, in diseased joints. Moreover, it appears as if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> confers adverse effects by stimulating cartilage
        degradation through an unknown mechanism. In contrast to
        the adverse effects of intra-articular adenoviral gene
        transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>, we have shown that gene transfer of
        insulin-like growth factor type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to the rabbit knee
        results in an increase in new matrix synthesis without any
        adverse effects [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        Taken together, these results suggest that increasing
        the intra-articular levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> has no therapeutic
        effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage metabolism</ENAMEX>, resulting instead in higher
        rates in cartilage degradation. Use of the synovium as a
        target tissue for TGF-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene transfer, resulting in
        elevating the intra-articular level, is thus not
        appropriate for the enhancement of repair of cartilage
        defects. Instead, for TGF-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene therapy to be effective
        in promoting repair of damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, the level of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> will need to be highly regulated as well as
        expression localized. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression would need to be
        targeted, at the appropriate levels, to the site of
        cartilage damage, such as through gene transfer to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chondrocytes</ENAMEX> or stem cells involved in repairing the
        damaged tissues.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> has been shown to be therapeutic in several
        different animal models when expressed systemically from
        muscle tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . This suggests that elevated serum
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> can reduce general inflammation as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">inhibit IL-1Î²</ENAMEX> and tumor necrosis factor alpha production,
        resulting in a systemic therapeutic effect. In addition,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> has been shown to be therapeutic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">murine</TIMEX> models of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> following delivery in
        genetically modified T cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . This observation
        suggests that targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of
        inflammation through the use of arthogenic T cells also can
        be therapeutic. However, our results suggest that local
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>, unlike systemic expression, is not
        therapeutic due to adverse pathologies associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">elevated intra-articular TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression.
        Although our results do not preclude the development of
        gene therapy approaches to express regulated TGF-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systemically</ENAMEX> to downmodulate the immune response, the
        results suggest that any clinical application of local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> gene transfer should proceed with caution. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is
        clearly a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytokine</ENAMEX>, able to confer multiple effects
        when expressed intra-articularly 
        in vivo .
      
      
        Conclusion
        Gene transfer represents a novel method for obtaining
        high intra-articular levels of therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for the
        treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> is able to stimulate new
        matrix synthesis by chondrocytes in culture as well as able
        to reduce inflammation 
        in vivo . In this report, the effects
        of intra-articular expression on both naÃ¯ve and arthritic
        rabbit knee joint pathology were examined by
        adenoviral-mediated intra-articular gene transfer of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX>. The results suggest that elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression
        confers adverse joint pathology including an increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage matrix degradation</ENAMEX> without stimulating new matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² expression induces muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edema</ENAMEX> and fibrogenesis.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> may have certain anti-inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, it is unable to stimulate repair of damaged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartilage</ENAMEX>, and even stimulates cartilage degradation.
        Moreover, elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TGF-Î²1</ENAMEX> expression also induced muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edema</ENAMEX> and fibrogenesis. Gene transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î²<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovium</ENAMEX> is thus not suitable for treating intra-articular
        pathologies, such as the repair of damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoarthritis</ENAMEX>.
