        Focal damage to the developing brain can have widespread
        consequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and regions that project to or
        receive direct or even indirect projections from the
        damaged area [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Focal neocortical malformations
        induced by freeze injury to the developing cortical plate
        exemplify this fact. It has been shown that these
        malformations, resembling human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microgyria</ENAMEX>, are associated
        with widespread disturbances in neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        ] . For example, brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">slices</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microgyric</ENAMEX> cortex
        show increased epileptogenic activity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        Microgyric anomalies are also associated with connectional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] , affecting both thalamic and
        cortico-cortical connectivity. In addition, changes in
        neuronal cell size distribution in the medial geniculate
        nuclei associated with the presence of neocortical
        malformations, have been demonstrated in both human
        dyslexic brains [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and rat brains [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        Along with these structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alterations</ENAMEX>, damage to the
        developing brain produces functional changes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ,
        suggesting that structural changes are not necessarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maladaptive</ENAMEX> in all cases. For example, the presence of
        neocortical malformations in certain strains of inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        are correlated with better performance on tasks of spatial
        reference memory [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . On the other hand, induced
        microgyric <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> show a variety of behavioral deficits
        that suggest disturbances to multiple brain systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . Rapid auditory processing deficits have been
        found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microgyria</ENAMEX> using both an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">operant condition paradigm</ENAMEX> and a reflex modification
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paradigm</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . In both paradigms, auditory
        processing deficits were found only on rapidly changing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimuli</ENAMEX>, and not when these same stimuli were delivered at
        slower rates. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with induced microgyria
        showed poorer performance in discrimination learning and
        took longer paths to the target in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris Water Maze</ENAMEX>
        than sham littermates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        The extent of brain-wide changes induced by the
        relatively restricted freezing lesion that produces
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microgyria</ENAMEX> is, however, unknown. Here we present evidence
        that induced bilateral focal microgyria leads to
        significant reductions in overall brain weight that are
        quite robust, being seen at all ages measured (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P30 - P118</ENAMEX>),
        in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, and are unaffected by acoustic
        rearing experiences. Moreover, volumetric analysis suggests
        this reduction largely reflects a disproportionate decrease
        of neocortical tissue.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Body Weight Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Differences in body weight within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> study were
          examined by analysis of variance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In
          Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, there was a significant effect of rearing
          condition (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,34</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.1</NUMEX>, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>), with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the enriched condition having significantly
          smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> weights than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in either of the other
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. There were no other significant main effects
          or interactions. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study 2</ENAMEX>, there was the expected
          highly significant effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,50</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508.6</NUMEX>, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>), but no
          other significant effects. There was also an expected
          effect of Sex in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study 3</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> weighing
          significantly less than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,36</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">685.2</NUMEX>, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>); there were
          no other significant effects. Due to the significant main
          effects of body weight in these studies, we regressed out
          the effects of body weight on all subsequent
          analyses.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brain Weight Analyses</ENAMEX>
          Brain weight measures were regressed against body
          weight, and the residuals were used as the dependent
          measure in an ANOVA (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> showed a
          highly significant effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,34</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.83</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>),
          reflecting a decreased brain weight in microgyric
          subjects compared to shams across environments (Figure
          2A). There was no interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,34</NUMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), nor main effect of
          Environment (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,34</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.50</NUMEX>; ns). Study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> also showed
          a highly significant effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,50</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48.43</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>), with the
          presence of microgyric lesion associated with decreased
          brain weight (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). There was no main effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX>
          (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,50</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.03</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>; the effects of body
          size differences having been regressed out) nor was there
          a significant interaction between main effects (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,50</NUMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesion</ENAMEX> once
          again had a significant effect on brain weight (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,36</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.86</NUMEX>; p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), with
          microgyric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> associated with decreased overall
          brain weight (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). There was no <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Lesion</ENAMEX> Ã— Sex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,36</NUMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), nor main effect of Sex
          (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,36</NUMEX> <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Brain Volume Analyses
          In an attempt to localize the effects of microgyric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> on brain weight, we assessed total brain area,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neocortical</ENAMEX> area, and microgyric lesion area, and
          estimated volume in a randomly selected subset of
          subjects from Study 1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> microgyric, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> sham;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deprived N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> microgyric, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> sham; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enriched N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          microgyric, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sham). Volume measures were linearly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regressed</ENAMEX> against body weight, and the residuals were
          used as the dependent measure (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). For
          microgyric volume, only lesioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were included
          in the regression. An initial ANOVA, using residuals of
          microgyria volume as the dependent measure and
          Environment as the independent measure, showed no
          difference among the different environmental conditions
          (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,16</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.51</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>). This demonstrates an
          equivalent microgyria size in all environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          An ANOVA on total brain volume revealed a significant
          effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.11</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< .001</NUMEX>) and
          Environment (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.35</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>), but no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.33</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>). As can be seen in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, microgyric <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had smaller brain volumes
          than their sham <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> across all conditions. Among
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, those from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acoustically Enriched</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had smaller residuals than
          the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> using the residuals of neocortical volume as
          the dependent measure were similar to those of brain
          volume (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). Microgyric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had smaller
          neocortical volumes than shams (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38.00</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>),
          irrespective of environmental condition. Environmental
          effects remained significant (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.27</NUMEX>, p<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), with those
          subjects in the acoustically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enriched</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> having
          smaller neocortical volume residuals than those in the
          other conditions. There was no interaction between Lesion
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,31 <</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>).
          An ANOVA was performed for non-neocortical volume
          (computed by total brain volume minus neocortical
          volume), to assess whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> effects and
          Environmental effects were specific to cortex, or
          distributed through non-neocortical areas as well.
          Analysis showed a main effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.62</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), and
          Environment (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.83</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), with no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.85</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; see Figure
          3C). However, relative F values suggested that while
          Environment main effects were equivalent between cortex
          and non-cortex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> effects were more pronounced in
          the neocortex.
          To directly assess the issue of a disproportionate
          loss of neocortical volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lesion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, we
          computed the ratio of neocortical to total brain volume,
          regressed those values against body weight, and analyzed
          the residuals. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> revealed a significant effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.66</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) but not
          Environment (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,31</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.97</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>), and no
          interaction between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (F 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,31 <</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS</ENAMEX>). Thus, microgyric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had disproportionately smaller cortices than
          their sham <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>). Environment,
          conversely, affected the whole brain and had no
          significant effects on this ratio measure. It is
          important to note that the enrichment procedure of this
          study differed significantly from those used previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] in that it began prenatally. Future research will be
          needed to determine what possible effects this additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> had on subjects' body weight and brain
          volume.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The current findings show that early focal brain
        injuries, specifically P1 focal freezing necrosis producing
        microgyria, lead to reductions in brain weight that are so
        robust that the main effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> does not interact
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX>, or Sex. Analysis of histologic brain
        and neocortical volume confirmed the effects of lesion on
        brain weight, and suggest that the reduction in volume
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with microgyria is proportionally greater in the
        cerebral cortex. This finding supports previous work
        suggesting that substantial reorganization of the brain is
        triggered by the induction of bilateral freezing damage.
        Surprisingly, this reorganization was not differentially
        affected across ages, by an enriched environment, nor by
        the difference in brain weight between the sexes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">e.g.,.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refs.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] ). Further, reorganization (i.e.,
        brain weight and volume reduction due to microgyria) was
        evident by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P30</TIMEX> and remained consistent into adulthood.
        Since reductions in brain weight and total brain volume
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Microgyric</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX>) subjects reflect disproportionate
        loss of neocortical tissue, it is important to address the
        unlikely possibility that this effect reflects direct
        tissue loss from lesion induction. This is unlikely because
        no tissue was removed. Further, though microgyric
        neocortical tissue showed anomalous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, there was
        no demonstrable tissue reduction localized to the
        malformation itself (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesion</ENAMEX> effects, the reduction in brain volume
        seen in subjects raised in an acoustically Enriched
        environment was evident throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">neocortical</TIMEX> and
        non-neocortical regions, with no disproportionate effects
        in cortex. It is possible that this reduction reflects the
        smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size of enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (who were highly
        active), and which may not have been fully accounted for in
        the residual measure due to a low n and accordingly low
        correlation. Further research will be needed to reconcile
        this smaller brain size with reports of increased brain
        weight in enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26</NUMEX> ] . It is important
        to note that the environmental enrichment methods employed
        in this study are fundamentally different from those used
        in other studies; for example, our auditory environment
        differences began prenatally and extended until
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kolb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cioe</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] also found a reduction in
        brain weight following aspiration <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of frontal cortex
        performed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX>. Although aspiration differs from freezing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX>, both techniques were applied within the period of
        neural migration, and have demonstrated little effect of
        specific location of the lesion on a variety of measures
        (e.g., behavior, brain weight, thalamic morphology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 30</NUMEX>
        ] ). These factors indicate that subsequent systematic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> (e.g., in function) may reflect a developmental
        cascade leading to distal changes, rather than stemming
        from the focal injury per se.
      
      
        Conclusions
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model of microgyric neuromigrational anomalies
        has been employed to demonstrate a reduced brain weight in
        microgyric subjects that is consistent across variable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ages</ENAMEX>, environments, and sex. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, this effect
        appears to reflect a disproportionate reduction of
        neocortical volume. Since differences in brain weight have
        been shown to be proportional to total brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content
        and thus total CNS cell number [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] , and since brain
        weight has been suggested to be a good surrogate measure
        for total cell number in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] ), we
        hypothesize that total cell number - particularly in cortex
        - may be decreased in microgyric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
        Alternatively, the decrease in brain weight could
        reflect changes in neuropil rather than cell numbers. It is
        important to note that the highly significant Microgyria
        effects on whole brain, and particularly cerebral cortex,
        are seen despite a lack of body weight differences between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Environment effects, conversely,
        may be accounted for at least partly by significant body
        weight differences (due to activity differences) that may
        not fully have been accounted for in residual scores (due
        to relatively small subject numbers). Collective results
        have critical implications for the profound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-organizational effects of relatively small focal
        injuries early in development, specifically to affect
        distributed systems throughout the brain and in particular
        the cerebral cortex. Future research will explore these
        issues.

          On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P1</TIMEX> (day of birth = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P0</NUMEX>), litters were culled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat pups</ENAMEX> for focal microgyria induction. Pups were
          randomly designated to receive bilateral freezing lesions
          or sham surgery, balancing treatment within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">litters</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Focal microgyric lesions</ENAMEX> were induced using a
          modification of the technique employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DvorÃ¡k</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] ; and explained in detail elsewhere
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pups</ENAMEX> assigned to the lesion condition
          received hypothermia induced anesthesia followed by a
          small midline incision over the skull. A cooled (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-70Â°C</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-mm</ENAMEX> diameter stainless steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was placed on the
          skull <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> of the sagittal suture
          overlying bregma for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> sec. Following the initial lesion,
          an identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lesion</ENAMEX> was placed in the opposite hemisphere
          (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> lesion side randomly determined) using a second
          cooled probe. Sham <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> had identical treatment,
          except the steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was maintained at room
          temperature. Following treatment, the skin was sutured,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were marked with ink <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">footpad</ENAMEX> injections,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warmed</ENAMEX>, and returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study Groups
          A summary of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is presented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> assessed environmental variations on the
          effects of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P1</NUMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microgyria</ENAMEX> in male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
          Litters were raised from embryonic day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E7</NUMEX>) to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P70</NUMEX>) in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> environmental conditions.
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was reared in the normal housing area
          (background room noise = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45-55</NUMEX> dB), and was pair-housed
          by treatment at weaning (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P21</NUMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Noise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
          reared in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h. exposure to a broad
          band white noise (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80 dB</NUMEX>), and was pair-housed by
          treatment at weaning. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enriched</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was reared in a
          separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 h</NUMEX> of non-vocal, light classical
          music exposure (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75-78</NUMEX> dB) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> as the dark period began,
          and was group housed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>) at weaning in an enriched
          housing condition. Brain analysis (see below) occurred on
          P118 (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] for further study details). Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          assessed the effects of P1 induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microgyria</ENAMEX> in male
          rats across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stages of development. To accommodate
          auditory testing, pups were weaned on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P24</TIMEX> and pairhoused
          by treatment in the normal housing area. Brain analysis
          (see below) occurred on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P30</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P52</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P83</TIMEX>. Study <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          assessed the effects of P1 induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microgyria</ENAMEX> in males
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">weaning</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P21</NUMEX>), pups were pair-housed by
          sex and treatment in the normal housing area. Brain
          analysis (see below) occurred on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P110</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brain Weight Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were weighed, anesthetized and transcardially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perfused</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX> saline, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphate Buffered Formalin</ENAMEX>).
          Heads were removed, placed in formalin, and shipped to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GDR</ENAMEX> for anatomical analysis. Brains were removed (spinal
          cord removed at the caudal extent of the cerebellum) and
          weighed. The brains were then embedded in celloidin as
          described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 35</NUMEX> ] , sliced at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î¼m</NUMEX>, and
          every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> section stained with cresyl <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">violet</ENAMEX> and
          mounted onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides. Microgyric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> were
          confirmed and location assessed.
          Separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>'s were performed on brain weight
          residuals for each study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> after regressing against
          body weight (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2</ENAMEX>), using either a linear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Studies</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX>), or a logarithmic regression
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study 2</ENAMEX>). The logarithmic regression for Study 2
          compensated for the confound between brain weight and age
          in this study. Each study's specific treatment groups
          served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Between Subject variables - Study 1</ENAMEX>:

          Brain Volume <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Volumes were estimated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stereo Investigator</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbrightfield Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) interfaced to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX> E800
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microscope</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) fitted with a Prior
          motorized stage (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prior Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). The areas of
          systematic series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> through the entire region
          of interest were measured using point counting, and the
          volumes estimated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cavalieri</ENAMEX>'s rule. In cases where
          there were missing sections, volumes were estimated using
          a parabolic approach [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Measures of total brain
          volume included the entire brain from olfactory bulb to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebellum</ENAMEX>. Cerebral cortex was measured from the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> on which it appeared through its caudal extent,
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> boundary defined by entorhinal cortex.
          For estimates of total brain and cerebral cortical
          volume, we measured every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> thsection using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mm
          2point counting grid (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13-18</NUMEX> sections for total brain
          volume, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-13</ENAMEX> sections for cerebral cortex). Microgyric
          volume was measured on every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> thsection using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 Î</NUMEX>¼m
          2grid (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-10</ENAMEX> sections/subject). The coefficient of error
          for these measures ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01 to 0.10</NUMEX>, with means
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.02 Â± 0.004</NUMEX> for brain volume, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05 Â± 0.011</NUMEX> for
          neocortical volume, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.06 Â± 0.02</NUMEX> for microgyria
          volume.
