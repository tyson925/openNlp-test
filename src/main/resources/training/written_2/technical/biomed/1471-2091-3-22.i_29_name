        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitin</ENAMEX>/proteasome-dependent proteolysis system
        has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular
        regulatory mechanisms, including transcription, signal
        transduction, and cell cycle control (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions that
        lead to the covalent attachment of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitins</ENAMEX> to substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In many cases,
        modification by ubiquityl moieties targets <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to the
        proteasome, ultimately resulting in their degradation. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX> reaction involves a minimum of three
        enzymes: An <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E1</TIMEX>, which mediates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent activation
        of ubiquitin, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an E2</TIMEX>, or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBC</ENAMEX>), which, together with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> ubiquitin ligase,
        transfers ubiquitin to the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. E3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> are
        of particular interest, as they mediate the substrate
        specificity of ubiquitylation reactions.
        Studies in budding yeast identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc4p</ENAMEX>, an E3
        ubiquitin ligase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that mediates the ubiquitylation
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK inhibitor Sic1p</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc4pconsists</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: the cullin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc53p</TIMEX>, the RING domain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein Hrt1p/Rbx1p/Roc1p</ENAMEX>, the adapter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Skp1p</ENAMEX>, and
        Cdc4p (reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ). Cdc4p contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, which are conserved in a wide variety of so-called
        F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal WD-repeats that are involved in
        binding the substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sic1p</ENAMEX> in a phosphorylation-dependent
        manner, and a central <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] that interacts with Skp1p
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Cdc53p in turn binds to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Skp1p</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hrt1p/Rbx1p/Roc1p</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> Cdc53p with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p/Ubc3p</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX>
        ] . 
        In vitro reconstitution demonstrated
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc4p</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc34p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E1</TIMEX>, ubiquitin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> are
        sufficient to mediate Sic1p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polyubiquitylation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> are widely conserved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3</NUMEX> ] . In human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, for example, SCF
        Skp2mediates destruction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK inhibitor p27</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ]
        , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> Î²-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRCPtargets</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IÎºB</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . All of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> share homologues of the core components
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CDC53/CUL1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SKP1</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HRT1/RBX1/ROC1</ENAMEX>, which associate with
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Several lines of evidence suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> pathway
        is also conserved in the fission yeast 
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Pcu1p, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdc53p/CUL1</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, was shown to associate with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-box/WD</ENAMEX> repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX>,
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overexpressed</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . In addition, genetic studies
        demonstrated that both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        simultaneously required for efficient destruction of Rum1p
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">replication initiator</ENAMEX> Cdc18p [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . Rum1p
        is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sic1p</NUMEX>-analogous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDK</ENAMEX> inhibitor, which accumulates in
        G1, but is degraded as cells enter S phase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        Failure to degrade <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rum1p</ENAMEX> is the major phenotypic defect of 
        pop1 and 
        pop2 deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, which leads to
        disturbance of normal cell cycle progression, resulting in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyploidy</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20 23</NUMEX> ] . Based on the genetic data and
        the biochemical observation that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX> interact
        when overexpressed, a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex</ENAMEX> was
        proposed, which would contain the heterooligomerizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins Pop1p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> bound to SCF core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] .
        Whether this unusual heterooligomeric SCF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex</ENAMEX> exists 
        in vivo and whether it mediates Rum1p
        ubiquitylation, remained unproven, as not all fission yeast
        SCF core subunits were identified. In addition, based on
        overexpression, distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1pand SCF</ENAMEX> Pop2pcomplexes
        were proposed to target unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX>, but no
        biochemical evidence of their activity was provided [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ]
        . To address these questions, we cloned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
        subunits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Popand</ENAMEX> performed a detailed
        characterization of its activity 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo . Our results indicate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterooligomeric SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pmediates</ENAMEX> Rum1p
        ubiquitylation whereas distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1pand</ENAMEX> SCF
        Pop2pcomplexes target unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic
        substrates, thereby generating combinatorial diversity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function in fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>.

          Composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-</ENAMEX>Pop2p
          Based on the composition of known SCF <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, we
          identified in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe genome database 
          psh1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pombe skp1 homologue</ENAMEX>) and 
          pip1 (pop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interacting protein 1</ENAMEX>),
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX> with strong similarity to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HRT1/RBX1/ROC1</ENAMEX>, respectively (data not
          shown). Consistent with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> being components
          of the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex</ENAMEX>, they all
          co-purified with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu1p</TIMEX> when
          overexpressed pairwise (data not shown).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co-immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> experiments using affinity
          purified rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisera</ENAMEX> confirmed these interactions at
          the level of the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. While each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antisera</ENAMEX> co-precipitated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the other
          subunits, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pip1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> antisera
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-precipitated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from wild-type cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Size fractionation of total cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysates</ENAMEX> prior to immunoprecipitation revealed co-elution
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pip1p with Pop1p</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu1p</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Psh1p</ENAMEX> in a high
          molecular weight complex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 500</NUMEX> kDa, which
          we refer to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). The composition
          of the core complex <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pip1p/Pcu1p/Psh1p</ENAMEX> did not undergo
          major variations during the cell cycle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). We have
          carefully reexamined potential cell cycle variations of
          Pcu1p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neddylation</ENAMEX> apparent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP</ENAMEX>/immunoblotting
          experiment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C. These variations were not seen
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were denatured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX> immediately following
          extract preparation (data not shown), suggesting that
          they arise from varying degrees of deneddylation
          presumably occuring during the immunoprecipitation step.
          In addition, in a separate experiment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pop1p</NUMEX>-Pop2p
          heterooligomerization was largely constant during the
          cell cycle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). These findings indicated that cell
          cycle-dependent substrate degradation is unlikely to be
          controlled at the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-</ENAMEX>Pop2pcomplex
          formation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pmediates</ENAMEX> polyubiquitylation of Rum1p
          in vitro
          Genetic experiments suggested that degradation of
          Rum1p depends on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Pop1p</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] , but also requires phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX> on
          serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 and threonine 62</NUMEX> by cyclin-dependent kinase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDK</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Thus, phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rum1p</ENAMEX> may be a
          substrate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p-</ENAMEX>mediated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyubiquitylation</ENAMEX>. To test this, we first confirmed that
          Rum1p is an 
          in vitro substrate for the Cdc2p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> in association with the cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cig1p</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] as
          judged by a mobility shift on SDS gels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacterially</ENAMEX> expressed Rum1p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purified</ENAMEX> to apparent
          homogeneity was also efficiently phosphorylated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cdc2p/Cig1p</ENAMEX> complexes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          To determine whether phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rum1p</ENAMEX> interacts
          with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein lysate</ENAMEX> was prepared from
          cells co-overexpressing epitope-tagged combinations of
          Pop1p and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>. Upon affinity purification on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX>-NTA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HA-Pop1p/His-Myc-Pop2p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were incubated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bacterially</ENAMEX> expressed, phosphorylated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX>. In this
          reaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p</ENAMEX> complexes specifically bound
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rum1p</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Consistent with
          the genetic data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">His-Myc-Pop1p</ENAMEX> and His-Myc-Pop2p
          individually purified upon overexpression in 
          pop1 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pop2</NUMEX> double mutants exhibited
          no Rum1p binding above background (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Given our ability to prepare immunopurified SCF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pthat</ENAMEX> bound phosphorylated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX>, we sought to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstitute</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rum1p</ENAMEX> polyubiquitylation 
          in vitro. In addition, we required
          an ubiquitin activating enzyme (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E1</NUMEX>) and an ubiquitin
          conjugating enzyme (UBC). While human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E1</ENAMEX> is highly
          similar to its fission <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> counterpart (data not
          shown), inspection of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe genome revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX>
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBCs</ENAMEX>, none of which is an obvious homologue of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UBC3</ENAMEX> or budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast Cdc34p</ENAMEX>, since all lack the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">characteristic C-</ENAMEX>terminal extension (data not shown). We
          therefore purified recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E1</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">UBC3</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CDC34</NUMEX>)
          upon expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C).
          In the presence of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">UBC3</TIMEX>, ubiquitin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pcomplexes</ENAMEX> immunopurified with Pip1p
          antibodies converted a small portion of phosphorylated
          Rum1p into high molecular weight <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D). This
          conversion was dependent on the addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown), and wild-type UBC3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D, lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4,6</NUMEX>).
          The activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p/Pop2pwas</ENAMEX> augmented when Pip1p
          complexes where purified from 
          csn5 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          This mutant accumulates <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pcu1p</ENAMEX> exclusively in a form
          carrying the stimulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nedd8p</ENAMEX> modification, due to a
          defect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">COP9</TIMEX>/signalosome-mediated cullin deneddylation
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Replacing wild-type ubiquitin by a mutant
          lacking all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lysine residues</ENAMEX> prevented the formation of
          high molecular weight products (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>),
          indicating that they represent polyubiquitylated Rum1p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> generated in the reaction. Similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyubiquitylated</ENAMEX> reaction products were detected upon
          incubation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylated Rum1p</ENAMEX> with Pcu1p
          immunocomplexes, further suggesting that the activity is
          mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p</ENAMEX>(data not shown). Moreover,
          Rum1p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitylation</ENAMEX> was not obtained with Pip1p
          complexes prepared from cell lysate of 
          pop2 deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>, proving the
          F-box protein dependency of this reaction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D, lane
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). In addition, the reaction was specific for human
          UBC3, as no ubiquitylation was obtained with fission
          yeast <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc7p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ubc11p</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ubc13p</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, lanes
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11</NUMEX>). Taken together these results strongly suggest
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pmediates</ENAMEX> the polyubiquitylation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorylated</ENAMEX> Rum1p 
          in vitro .
        
        
          Differential subcellular localization of SCF
          Pop1p-Pop2psubunits
          The co-purification of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> identified SCF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2psubunits</ENAMEX> and their 
          in vitro activity toward Rum1p
          suggested that they coexist in a common subcellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compartment</ENAMEX>. The nuclear localization of the only known
          substrates, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc18p</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.A.W.</ENAMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enriched</ENAMEX> in the nucleus. To test this
          assumption, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2psubunits</ENAMEX> were
          expressed as fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with green fluorescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) at low levels from an inducible pRep81
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX>. While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pip1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Psh1p</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pcu1p</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> were
          present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus,
          surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Pop1p</ENAMEX> was largely restricted to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). These localization patterns were
          consistently observed in each single cell of an
          asynchronous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, excluding major variations
          during the cell cycle.
          To rule out the possibility that overexpression or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal fusion to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> affects their localization,
          Pop1p and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> were modified with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal Myc
          epitope-tags at the endogenous genomic locus.
          Immunoblotting proved the expression of correctly sized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and, in addition, showed that endogenous Pop1p
          is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately twofold</NUMEX> more abundant in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe cells than Pop2p (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3B). Indirect immunofluorescence staining with Myc
          antibodies confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p</ENAMEX> is predominantly
          localized to cell nuclei, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pop2p</ENAMEX> is expressed in
          both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C).
          To confirm these localization patterns, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> derived
          from the epitope-tagged strains were biochemically
          fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components. The
          efficiency of enrichment of nuclear and cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> was estimated by analyzing fractions with
          antibodies recognizing the nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">marker PCNA</ENAMEX> and
          cytoplasmic tubulin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D). Although both fractions
          showed some contamination, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX> was detected mostly in
          nuclear fractions, while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX> was apparent in both
          nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D). Thus, all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2psubunits</ENAMEX> appear to coexist in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX>, although all but Pop1p are also present in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX>.
          Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX> interact with each other [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
          , we asked whether their localization patterns depended
          on the presence of the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction partner</ENAMEX>.
          For this, we created a 
          pop2 deletion strain carrying Pop1p
          modified with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Myc</ENAMEX> epitope tags at the endogenous
          genomic locus ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pop1-13myc Î”pop2</ENAMEX> strain ). In
          addition, we created the reciprocal 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pop2-13myc Î”pop1</ENAMEX> strain containing
          epitope-tagged endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop2p</ENAMEX> in a 
          pop1 deletion background. The
          distinct localization patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-13Myc</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p-13Myc</ENAMEX> were fully maintained in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3E). This observation was confirmed by overexpressing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-tagged Pop1p</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pop2p</NUMEX> in 
          pop1 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pop2</NUMEX> double deletion mutants
          (data not shown). These data indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p</ENAMEX> and
          Pop2p assume their subcellular localization pattern
          independent of each other, indicating the possibility of
          distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic homooligomeric SCF
          Pop1pand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2pcomplexes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Differential F-</ENAMEX>box requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop1p</ENAMEX> and
          Pop2p
          As shown above and in previous genetic work [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 20</NUMEX> ]
          , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p-dependent Rum1p</ENAMEX> degradation requires
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>boxes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). To better understand the apparent dual <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pfunction</ENAMEX>, we generated
          mutants of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX> lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>boxes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Î”F</ENAMEX>,
          Pop2p-Î”<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F; Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). In addition, we prepared a set of
          mutants, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>boxes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">swapped</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-2F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p-1F</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). The mutants were
          tested for their ability to suppress polyploidy and Rum1p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in the respective 
          pop mutant strains.
          As described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , wild-type Pop1p
          mildly overexpressed from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pRep81</NUMEX> plasmid fully
          complemented the polyploidization phenotype of 
          pop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> as determined by flow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cytometric</ENAMEX> measurement of the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> content (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          4C). In addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX> accumulation in 
          pop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> was efficiently
          reversed by wild-type Pop1p (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D). In contrast, Pop1p
          lacking its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Î”F</ENAMEX>) or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          was replaced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-2F</ENAMEX>) were
          largely inactive in both assays (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C,4<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). Thus, as
          with many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-box of Pop1p</ENAMEX> is
          essential for its 
          in vivo functions.
          In contrast, wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop2p</ENAMEX>, the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop2p</ENAMEX> containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p F-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> were equally
          effective in preventing Rum1p accumulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D). The
          same wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant proteins</ENAMEX> also reversed the mild
          polyploidy phenotype of 
          pop2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disruptants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C). Thus,
          in contrast to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> does not seem, to require its
          F-box to mediate Rum1p degradation 
          in vivo .
          To further substantiate this conclusion, we examined
          Rum1p <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> stability in wild-type and 
          pop mutant strains expressing
          F-box-deleted Pop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from the weak pRep81 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>.
          Since the sensitivity of our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rum1p</NUMEX> sera was insufficient
          to detect the low levels present in wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), these experiments were conducted in a
          background where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous Rum1p</ENAMEX> was modified with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          C-terminal c-Myc epitope tags. Rum1p half-life was
          increased from ~<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> in wild-type to greater than
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 minutes</TIMEX> in 
          pop1 or 
          pop2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). While <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          deleted Pop2p expressed from plasmids reduced Rum1p
          half-life to ~<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> in 
          pop2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box-deleted Pop1p
          was completely defective in rescuing the Rum1p
          proteolysis defect of 
          pop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Instead,
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Î”F</ENAMEX> in 
          pop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> led to even greater
          stabilization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX>, potentially due to dominant
          negative interference with the residual activity of Pop2p
          and/or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          F-box independent interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop1p</ENAMEX> and
          Pop2p
          The failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p F-</ENAMEX>box to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box of
          Pop1p as well as the finding that it is not essential for
          Rum1p degradation could be explained, if it was not
          critically involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-</ENAMEX>Pop2pprotein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. We therefore tested the possibility that
          Pop2p can be tethered to the SCF core complex
          independently of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box via an interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>.
          Consistent with this hypothesis, co-immunoprecipitation
          experiments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overexpressed proteins</ENAMEX> revealed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p</ENAMEX> interaction occurs independently of the
          F-boxes of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6A).
          We had previously mapped the domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX> that
          interacts with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pop1p</NUMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal fragment consisting
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">241</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and lacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box ( [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). In co-immunoprecipitation
          experiments with overexpressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, this fragment
          also bound to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal piece containing the first
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">402</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). Thus, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> is mediated by their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. A further truncation mutant mapped the Pop2p
          binding domain to a region between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues 228</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">402</NUMEX>
          of Pop1p (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B, lanes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1pand SCF Pop2pcomplexes</ENAMEX> bearing
          ubiquitin ligase activity
          The apparent dispensibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-box of Pop2p</ENAMEX> for
          Rum1p degradation and binding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pop1p</NUMEX> raised the
          question of why Pop2p does contain an F-box. Based on the
          subcellular localization data, we considered the
          possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX> may mediate the
          assembly of a cytoplasmically localized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2pcomplex</ENAMEX>,
          independent of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>. To demonstrate this, we again used
          the strain in which endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop2p</ENAMEX> was modified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          Myc epitope tags in a 
          pop1 deletion background. The same
          experiments were carried out with the reverse stain,
          which contained <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-13Myc</ENAMEX> in a 
          pop2 background. As a reference for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Popcomplex</ENAMEX> formation, we used strains carrying 13Myc
          epitope-tagged Pop1p or Pop2p integrated into the genome
          of wild-type cells.
          Pip1p <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunoprecipitates</ENAMEX> were prepared from lysates of
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> strains and appropriate controls, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-purification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> was determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoblotting</ENAMEX>. These experiments showed that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, in the absence of their respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterooligomerization</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, could individually bind to
          Pip1p in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that also contained Psh1p and Pcu1p
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). These findings indicate the existence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinct SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1pand SCF</ENAMEX> Pop2pcomplexes 
          in vivo .
          To further substantiate this conclusion, we used gel
          filtration to compare the elution profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop1p</ENAMEX> and
          Pop2p in the presence or absence of their respective
          dimerization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. If recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop2p</ENAMEX> into a
          high molecular weight SCF complex required
          heterooligomerization with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>, its elution profile
          would be expected to shift to a smaller size in the
          absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>. Consistent with the results presented
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> core subunits,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eluted</ENAMEX> in fractions corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 - 600 kDa,</ENAMEX>
          irrespective of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p</ENAMEX> was present or not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          7B). In the reverse experiment, the elution profile of
          Pop1p was found to be independent of the presence of
          Pop2p (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
          While these data support the existence of distinct SCF
          Pop1pand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2pcomplexes</ENAMEX>, individual binding of Pop1p
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> to SCF core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in the absence of their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterodimerizing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> does not rule out
          the possibility that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> represent inactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intermediates</ENAMEX> formed during the normal assembly of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2pcomplexes</ENAMEX>. To exclude this
          possibility, we asked whether distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1pand</ENAMEX> SCF
          Pop2pcomplexes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> ubiquitin ligase activity 
          in vitro . To this end, we
          performed 
          in vitro ubiquitylation assays.
          Since the substrates of putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1pand</ENAMEX> SCF
          Pop2pubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligases</ENAMEX> are unknown, we adopted a
          substrate-independent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> originally described by
          Lyapina 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . For this
          experiment, we again used the strains harboring
          genomically integrated Myc epitope-tagged Pop1p or Pop2p
          in a background deficient in the respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterooligomerization</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> ( 
          Î”pop2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pop1-13myc</ENAMEX> , 
          Î”pop1 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pop2-13myc</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX>). Pop1p
          and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Pop2p</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were immunopurified with Myc
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and employed in 
          in vitro ubiquitylation assays upon
          addition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">UBC3</TIMEX>, ubiquitin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. High molecular
          weight products generated in the reaction were detected
          by immunoblotting with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ubiquitin antibodies</ENAMEX>. As
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">references</ENAMEX>, we used strains expressing Myc-tagged Pop1p
          or Pop2p in a wild-type background. The experiment
          demonstrated that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX> each associate with
          polyubiquitylation activity even in the absence of their

        Discussion
        
          Molecular architecture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> Popcomplexes
          The phenomenon of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein oligomerization</ENAMEX> is not
          unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Pop</ENAMEX>. Although the crystal structure of the
          SKP1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">SKP2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, derived from bacterially expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, revealed a single SKP2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> bound to SKP1 [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> ] , biochemical studies showed that budding yeast
          Cdc4p, a close homologue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p\Pop2p</ENAMEX>, forms
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homooligomers</ENAMEX> when expressed in insect cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correll</ENAMEX> and
          Deshaies, personal communication). Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î²-TRCP1</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, which target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºBÎ± for degradation as homooligomers,
          form heterooligomers that each bind SCF core subunits,
          although no biochemical activity for this
          heterooligomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
          Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homooligomerize</ENAMEX>, at least when
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] , indicating that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> may also be present as homooligomers in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individual SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1pand SCF Pop2p</ENAMEX>, respectively.
          A surprising finding of this study was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> is dispensable for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX> degradation and ploidy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-box of Pop1p</ENAMEX> is essential for both
          functions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4Dand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p F-</ENAMEX>box is unlikely to
          be a degenerate, non-functional, and hence dispensable,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motif</ENAMEX>, as it carries all signature <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). In addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>, in the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>,
          assembles into a complex containing all SCF core subunits
          identified here (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). At present, we cannot exclude
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box mediate binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">deleted Pop2p</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Psh1p</NUMEX> and other core subunits.
          Consistent with this idea, biochemical studies based on
          the crystal structure of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP1-SKP2</ENAMEX> complex
          revealed cooperation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP2 F-</ENAMEX>box with an adjacent
          region in binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SKP1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with this
          finding, certain truncation mutants of the budding yeast
          F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins Grr1p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc4p</ENAMEX> interact poorly with
          Skp1p, despite the retainment of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>boxes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ]
          . On the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-box of Pop1p</ENAMEX> is essential for
          Rum1p degradation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> outside
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> are insufficient to mediate recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pop</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          Based on the non-essential function of the Pop2p
          F-box, we propose a molecular architecture of SCF
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p</ENAMEX>, in which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX> is tethered to the core
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> through interaction with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>. Although we have
          no direct biochemical evidence to confirm this
          proposition, which would require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pop2p</NUMEX> point mutants
          deficient in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX> binding, our data show that severely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated N</ENAMEX>-terminal fragments of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX> lacking
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>boxes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WD</ENAMEX> repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> are sufficient to
          mediate their interaction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B). Similarly,
          dimerization of Î²-TRCP <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-domains" lacking binding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKP1</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> core
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . According to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box of
          Pop2p would be essential only for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Pop1p</NUMEX>-independent
          activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>, for which we provide tentative
          evidence by demonstrating the 
          in vivo assembly of SCF
          Pop2pcomplexes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> bear ubiquitin
          ligase activity in a substrate-independent 
          in vitro assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C). To what
          extent this assay reflects the 
          in vivo activity of SCF Pop2pwill
          become testable, once the putative substrates of SCF
          Pop2pare identified.
        
        
          Subcellular compartmentalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF Popas</ENAMEX> a
          potential mechanism for substrate selection
          Another surprising observation of this study was that
          Pop1p is primarily localized to the nucleus, whereas
          Pop2p is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). While, nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> was expected, since
          both known substrates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-Pop2p</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc18p</ENAMEX> and
          Rum1p, are primarily nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the cytoplasmic
          localization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX> suggests an activity of SCF
          Pop2pdirected toward unknown cytoplasmic substrates. In
          support of this notion, as with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCF subunits</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fission yeast</ENAMEX> SCF core subunits are also present in the
          cytoplasm, as shown here for overexpressed GFP-fusions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A), and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">endogenous Pcu1p</TIMEX> by immunostaining in
          a previous report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
          By analogy, additional nuclear substrates of SCF
          Pop1pmay exist. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p</ENAMEX> is involved in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels of the cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cig2p</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
          While it is unclear whether this effect is mediated at
          the level of transcription or mRNA stability, the budding
          yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Met30p</ENAMEX> was recently shown to regulate
          the ubiquitylation and activity, but not degradation, of
          the transcription factor Met4p [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . In addition, 
          pop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> display an increased
          rate of chromosome loss, a phenotype that is not easily
          explained by accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rum1p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cdc18p</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
          Finally, 
          pop1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are sensitive to UV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irradiation</ENAMEX>, whereas 
          pop2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> are not (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> Griffiths
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.A.W.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation). It is therefore
          likely that other substrates of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p and Pop2p</TIMEX>, in
          addition to their common substrates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc18p and Rum1p</TIMEX>, do
          exist.
          The idea developed above that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box protein
          compartmentalization contributes to substrate selection
          was recently confirmed directly for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cdc4p</NUMEX>-mediated
          degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Far1p</ENAMEX> in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Both,
          Cdc4p and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Far1p</ENAMEX> are nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in vegetative cells,
          owing to the presence of nuclear localization signals
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX>). Fusion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdc4p</TIMEX> with a nuclear export signal
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NES-Cdc4p</ENAMEX>) prevented its nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> and its
          ability to direct the degradation of nuclear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Far1p</TIMEX>. When
          Far1p also was targeted to the cytoplasm by disrupting
          its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NES-Cdc4p degraded Î”NLS-Far1</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> ] .
          A putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> is also present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus of</ENAMEX>
          Pop1p located between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box and the WD-repeat domain
          ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">393PEKIKRC</NUMEX>). An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal Pop1p fragment containing
          this motif, when fused to the WD-repeat region of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>,
          is targeted exclusively to the nucleus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.L.</ENAMEX> &
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.A.W.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation). Like wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pop2p</ENAMEX>,
          the reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p-N/Pop1p-C</ENAMEX> chimera localizes to both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> and the cytoplasm, again indicating that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop1p</TIMEX>,
          but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX>, has a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> in its N-terminus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.L. & D.A.W.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observation). It is
          unclear, at present, what regulates Pop2p distribution.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> is co-imported in a complex
          with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> subunits that is preformed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Pop2p</TIMEX> distribution is independent of
          Pop1p (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3E), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> core subunits are the most likely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for such a function. In line with this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suggestion</ENAMEX>, it was previously demonstrated that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HRT1/ROC1/RBX1</ENAMEX> promotes nuclear accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CUL1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
          ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Our data suggest homo- and heterooligomerization of the
        F-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins Pop1p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2p</ENAMEX> as a mechanism for
        generating combinatorial diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> function in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. A heterooligomeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop1p-</ENAMEX>Pop2pcomplex
        mediates polyubiquitylation of phosphorylated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rum1p</TIMEX>. In
        addition, compartmentalization of homooligomeric SCF
        Pop1pand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pop2pcomplexes</ENAMEX> may direct the ubiquitylation
        of unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates.
