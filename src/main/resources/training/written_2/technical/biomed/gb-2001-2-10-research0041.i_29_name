        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have proven very useful in establishing
        molecular definitions of human cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtypes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3</ENAMEX>].
        In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> that were assigned to a single
        diagnostic category by conventional morphological
        diagnostic methods have been found to have different gene
        expression profiles and belong to distinct molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX>. In particular, diffuse large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B-cell</ENAMEX> lymphoma
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX>) was shown to consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> molecular
        subtypes that differed in the expression of over several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hundred genes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtypes</ENAMEX> had strikingly different long-term outcomes
        following conventional multi-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> chemotherapy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
        with germinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> had a favorable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX>, with an apparent cure rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>. On the other
        hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with activated B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> had a poor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a quarter</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> alive
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> following therapy. Therefore, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        activated B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX>, alternative therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> must
        be identified.
        For this reason, we have begun a survey of novel cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in order to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with significant activity
        against activated B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX>. One drug identified in this
        screen, flavopiridol, was found to be significantly
        cytotoxic for cell lines derived from activated B-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flavopiridol</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
        cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that have varying
        activities against the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple CDK</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CDK1,</ENAMEX>
        CDK2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK6 and CDK7</TIMEX>) by competitively blocking their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding pocket [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. In addition to
        arresting cells 
        in vitro at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">G2</NUMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and the
        G1-to-S transitions, flavopiridol decreases the rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> through S phase. Since flavopiridol is being
        evaluated in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple cancer</ENAMEX> clinical trials [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 9</ENAMEX>], and
        has been shown to be highly active in inducing apoptosis in
        hematopoietic neoplasms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], we were interested in
        whether flavopiridol might be effective against activated
        B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX>.
        Although it is clear that flavopiridol inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDKs</ENAMEX>,
        whether flavopiridol inhibits other cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> is not
        known. Recently, flavopiridol was found to inhibit the
        activity of a transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, a
        complex of cyclins with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK9</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-TEFb</ENAMEX> phosphorylates
        the carboxy-terminal domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> II
        complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], facilitating transcription elongation. It
        was not known, however, whether P-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEFb</ENAMEX> regulates
        transcriptional elongation of all cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or whether
        other factors promote transcriptional elongation on subsets
        of cellular genes.
        Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX>, we found that flavopiridol
        inhibited gene expression broadly in a manner highly
        related to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcription inhibitors</ENAMEX> such as
        actinomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,6-dichloro-1-Î²-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole</NUMEX> (DRB). We
        were therefore able to use flavopiridol to study the
        turnover rate of mRNA on a genomic-scale. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> turnover is
        regulated by a variety of cellular factors acting on
        cis-elements in mRNA molecules. For many labile mRNAs,
        adenylate uridylate-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (AREs) are required for
        their rapid degradation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> different classes of ARE
        have been defined [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. A conserved motif present in two
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUUUA</ENAMEX>, plays an important role in
        transcript stability for many cytokines and early-response
        genes (ERGs) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. However, there is now increasing
        evidence that other motifs may determine the stability of
        transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        By measuring mRNA turnover rates comprehensively, we
        identified unexpected relationships between the function of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and its mRNA stability. In addition, we found that
        genes that were transcriptionally inducible were
        disproportionately represented in the class of genes with
        labile mRNAs, thus revealing a coordinated strategy to
        rapidly modulate the mRNA levels of these genes. This
        understanding of mRNA turnover on a genomic scale provides
        fresh insights into the effectiveness of flavopiridol as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anti-cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        To investigate the effect of flavopiridol treatment on
        activated B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX>, we used cell line <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> as our
        model of activated B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> as its gene-expression
        profile closely resembles the profiles of lymphoma biopsy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with this type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. OCI-Ly3
        were treated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX> with flavopiridol (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) and gene
        expression changes were monitored using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphochip</ENAMEX> DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In comparison to untreated OCI-Ly3
        cells, flavopiridol treatment decreased expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">284</NUMEX>
        out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,032</NUMEX> microarray <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.64%</NUMEX>) by at least
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twofold</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Similarly, profound decreases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels were observed following flavopiridol treatment
        of other lymphoma cell lines (data not shown). The
        magnitude of the flavopiridol effect on gene expression was
        related to the dose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> used (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). We found
        that there was almost no effect on gene expression in cells
        treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> nM flavopiridol for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 and 3 hours</TIMEX> whereas
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nM flavopiridol induced broad changes in gene
        expression, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM flavopiridol was yet more potent in
        decreasing mRNA levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> receiving infusions of
        flavopiridol achieve a biologically active concentration in
        plasma of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. To relate these gene expression
        changes to the biological activity of flavopiridol, we
        assayed the viability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OCI-Ly3 cells</ENAMEX> treated with
        different doses of flavopiridol (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). Flavopiridol
        at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> had no effect on viability even
        after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> treatment. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> nM flavopiridol
        decreased the viability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>. Given
        the similar dose-response effects of flavopiridol on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX> and gene expression, it is likely that the
        global reduction in mRNA levels caused by flavopiridol is a
        major contributor to its cytotoxic action.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flavopiridol</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of CDK
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that have varying activities against the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple CDK</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. As most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding pocket of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDKs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], and all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDKs</ENAMEX> have similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding pockets, it was possible that
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CDK inhibitors</ENAMEX> also inhibit transcription. We
        determined whether the inhibition of transcription is
        specific to flavopiridol by comparing gene expression
        profiles of flavopiridol-treated cells with those of cells
        treated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors roscovitine</ENAMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9-nitropaullone.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roscovitine</ENAMEX> is a purine derivative that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibits</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CDK1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK2 and CDK5</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks cell</ENAMEX>-cycle
        progression both in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late G1/early</TIMEX> S and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9-nitropaullone</TIMEX>, the most potent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a
        novel class of the paullone CDK inhibitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, inhibits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CDK1/cyclin</ENAMEX> B at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> lower concentrations than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flavopiridol</ENAMEX> and roscovitine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24</TIMEX>]. As shown in
        Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1c</TIMEX>, the gene expression changes caused by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">roscovitine</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-nitropaullone were different from those
        of flavopiridol, and only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flavopiridol</ENAMEX> globally reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> levels.
        To determine whether flavopiridol affects transcription
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globally</ENAMEX>, we compared the gene expression profile of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">flavopiridol</ENAMEX> treatment with the gene expression profiles
        induced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells by treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> well-studied
        transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, actinomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB</ENAMEX>.
        Actinomycin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> inhibits transcription initiation broadly by
        intercalating into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB</ENAMEX> inhibits the
        transcription elongation factor P-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEFb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-TEFb</ENAMEX> is a
        complex of cyclins with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CDK9</TIMEX>, and flavopiridol can also
        inhibit this kinase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. However, it was not known
        whether P-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEFb</ENAMEX> regulates transcriptional elongation of all
        cellular genes, nor was it known whether flavopiridol would
        inhibit the same set of genes as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells were
        treated with each inhibitor, and the resultant changes in
        gene expression were found to be virtually
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indistinguishable</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). For the majority of
        well-measured genes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphochip</ENAMEX>, the mRNA abundance
        decreased with first-order kinetics (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and could
        therefore be used to measure mRNA turnover rates (see
        Materials and methods). Genes are grouped according to mRNA
        half-life in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>. The turnover rates of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative mRNAs</ENAMEX> were verified by northern blot
        analysis in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2band</NUMEX> quantitated in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2c</TIMEX>. These
        findings demonstrate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> compounds behave as
        global <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of transcription, and demonstrate that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-TEFb</ENAMEX> regulates the transcriptional elongation of most
        cellular genes. Further, the similar effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flavopiridol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRB</ENAMEX> argue that the predominant effect of
        flavopiridol on gene expression results from its ability to
        inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P-TEFb</ENAMEX>.
        To investigate whether the mRNA degradation rates were
        first-order, we fitted a linear regression model for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for each gene (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods). The
        adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-squared statistic, which is a measure of
        correlation between the observed data values and the
        predicted values from the linear model, shows how well a
        first-order kinetics <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> would describe the mRNA
        degradation rates. Figure 3shows a histogram of the
        adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-squared statistics obtained from fitting a model
        for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,794</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The median adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-squared
        was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.86</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79.7%</NUMEX> of the genes had an adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-squared
        statistic over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>, showing that most of the genes had
        first-order mRNA degradation rates.
        Given the demonstration that flavopiridol is a global
        transcriptional inhibitor, we wished to understand the
        selective activity of flavopiridol against certain cancer
        types 
        in vivo . Clearly, genes with short
        mRNA half-lives would be most rapidly and quantitatively
        inhibited by flavopiridol, and thus we wished to assign the
        genes with short half-lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells to functional
        classes. First, we searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in cellular
        proliferation that have unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>, as decreased
        expression of these genes might provide a mechanism by
        which flavopiridol preferentially targets proliferating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells. Microarray gene expression analysis can
        readily identify a proliferation 'signature' consisting of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of genes that vary in expression between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proliferating</ENAMEX> and quiescent cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 25</ENAMEX>]. Genes can be
        assigned to the proliferation signature on the basis of
        high expression in diverse cell lines and low expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</ENAMEX> (CLL), a malignancy in which
        the leukemic cells are primarily in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G0</TIMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase of the cell
        cycle [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Figure 4apresents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with half-lives of
        less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> for which the average expression in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
        cell lines was fourfold greater than the average expression
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CLL samples</ENAMEX>. This selection criteria identified 
        c-myc , a gene previously known to
        have a short-lived mRNA, and an obviously important target
        of flavopiridol given its role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> phase progression [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. Interestingly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</NUMEX> of these genes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/23</NUMEX>) are
        expressed preferentially in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase and/or encode proteins
        involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-</ENAMEX>phase events. These genes represent important
        targets of flavopiridol action as they encode <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-</ENAMEX>phase
        regulatory kinases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLK</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aurora/IPL1</ENAMEX>-related kinase, and
        ckshs2), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-</ENAMEX>phase checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CHK1</NUMEX>), and chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">segregation proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENP-E</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CENP-F</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4a</NUMEX>). Given
        the relatively short duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase in most cells, the
        short half-lives of these mRNAs may be important to ensure
        that key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-</ENAMEX>phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> are not expressed as the cell
        progresses from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase.
        Another important class of genes that might contribute
        to the efficacy of flavopiridol would include
        anti-apoptotic genes with rapid mRNA turnover (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> Bcl-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that were expressed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3 cells - A1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MCL1</NUMEX> - had mRNA half-lives
        shorter <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">than 3 hours</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> ( 
        c-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IAP1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-IAP2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAIP</ENAMEX> ) had very short
        mRNA half-lives and encode <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that act
        by directly binding to caspases <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 7</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NF</ENAMEX>-Îº
        B target gene 
        A20 , an inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> necrosis
        factor (TNF)-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], is expressed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells and had a very short mRNA half-life. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±
        is expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells, inhibition of A20 expression
        by flavopiridol treatment may contribute to its cytotoxic
        effect on these cells. In accord with these results,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">flavopiridol</ENAMEX> treatment was recently shown to downregulate
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MCL1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bag-1</ENAMEX>, and
        induce apoptosis in B-CLL cells treated with flavopiridol [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>].
        The majority of the genes with labile mRNAs, however,
        did not fall into the cell cycle or apoptosis categories
        but instead included many genes that are known to be
        inducible by cellular signaling. For example, transcription
        factors belonging to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NF-ÎºB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are activated by a
        wide variety of cellular signaling events, and several
        known NF-ÎºB target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ( 
        A1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-IAP1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-IAP2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB alpha, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IÎ</ENAMEX>ºB
        epsilon, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD54</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IL-6, IL-8, TNF</ENAMEX>-Î±, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IRF-4</ENAMEX> ) were found to
        have unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4d</NUMEX>). This observation led us to
        investigate the possibility that the class of genes that
        are transcriptionally induced by cellular signaling events
        is enriched for genes with labile mRNAs. We used Lymphochip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> to profile the changes in gene expression that
        occurred in response to a wide variety of signaling events:
        B-cell lymphoma cell lines stimulated by crosslinking the
        B-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptor</ENAMEX> or by treatment with phorbol ester
        and ionomycin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>), resting peripheral blood T cells
        stimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>, and peripheral blood monocytes
        stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Figure 4dshows genes
        with relatively short mRNA half-lives (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME"><2 hours</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-4
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>) that were also transcriptionally induced at least
        threefold in one of the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> experiments
        described above. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly one third</NUMEX> of the inducible genes
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells were in this rapid mRNA turnover category
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>). By contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.8%</NUMEX> of the genes that were not
        induced by these stimuli had mRNA half-lives of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 4</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
        This analysis of mRNA turnover in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cells
        therefore suggested that transcriptionally inducible genes
        are, as a class, likely to generate labile mRNAs. To test
        this notion, we profiled mRNA turnover rates in peripheral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood mononuclear cells</ENAMEX> (PBMCs) after stimulation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> were stimulated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>, at which time
        flavopiridol was added and mRNA levels were subsequently
        determined by microarray analysis. Genes were assigned to
        the inducible class if their mRNA levels increased more
        than fourfold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5a</TIMEX>, a
        substantial proportion (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX>) of the inducible genes had
        mRNA half-lives shorter than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. By contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 11%</NUMEX>
        of the non-inducible class of genes had mRNA half-lives
        less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70%</NUMEX> of these genes had
        mRNA half-lives <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than 6 hours</TIMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). This
        result confirmed, in an independent cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>, the
        observation that transcriptionally inducible genes
        preferentially encode rapidly degraded mRNAs.
        We next investigated the functional characteristics of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> assigned to each mRNA turnover class (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than one third</NUMEX> of genes regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> were both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducible</ENAMEX> and had mRNA half-lives of less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. By
        contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10%</NUMEX> of the genes encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were in this class. The apoptosis regulators
        included several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> discussed previously
        ( 
        A20, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MCL1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c-IAP2</ENAMEX> ), as well as
        potentially pro-apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as those for Fas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNF</ENAMEX> receptor type II. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PHLDA1</ENAMEX> is the human
        homolog of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TDAG51</TIMEX>, a pleckstrin-homology domain protein
        that may modulate apoptosis by regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fas</ENAMEX> ligand
        expression following stimulation through the T-cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. It is well known that apoptosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes
        is an elaborately orchestrated process following lymphocyte
        activation that allows clonal expansion of the activated T
        cells while eventually eliminating the clone through the
        process of activation-induced cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Thus,
        anti-apoptotic gene products are required early during
        lymphocyte activation, whereas attenuation of the clonal
        burst eventually requires pro-apoptotic signaling through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. This change in apoptotic
        responsiveness may be accomplished rapidly by combining
        transcriptional regulation with rapid mRNA turnover of key
        apoptosis-regulatory genes.
        Transcriptional reprogramming following lymphocyte
        activation involves the coordinate induction of
        transcription factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] and many of these were found to
        have labile mRNAs (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>). Several of these genes are
        known to encode immediate early transcription factors (for
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FosB</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NAB2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ATF-3</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NOT1</TIMEX>) that are induced by a
        wide range of cellular stimuli, and this class of
        transcription factors is well known to have unstable mRNAs
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. Other inducible transcription factors with labile
        mRNAs have more lymphocyte-specific functions, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IRF-4</ENAMEX>, a factor that is required for lymphocyte activation
        but is not required in other lineages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        Not surprisingly, the most inducible class of genes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> encoded cytokines, chemokines and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>). Within this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 25%</NUMEX> of genes had
        mRNA half-lives of less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. As expected, many
        cytokine mRNAs were both rapidly inducible and rapidly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degraded</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5d</NUMEX>). Unexpectedly, the chemokine genes had
        much more stable mRNAs than the cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, even though
        they were strongly induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PI</ENAMEX> treatment (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5d</NUMEX>). The
        mRNAs for the cytokine and chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differed</ENAMEX> in their stability. The inducible chemokine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors CCR1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR5</ENAMEX> had labile mRNAs, whereas most of
        the inducible cytokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î±</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>) had relatively stable mRNAs. The differential
        mRNA stabilities of cytokines, chemokines and their
        receptors reflect their divergent biological functions.
        Cytokines potently induce activation and differentiation of
        target cells in a tightly regulated temporal fashion during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> responses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. To limit inappropriate effects of
        cytokines both temporally and spatially on bystander cells,
        the levels of these factors must be modulated rapidly,
        which can be achieved given their short mRNA half-lives. On
        the other hand, chemokines are chemoattractants that signal
        leukocyte migration by setting up concentration gradients
        that are recognized by chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. The
        inducible chemokines are used in inflammatory responses and
        wound healing to attract the appropriate complement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> cells to the affected tissues. These cellular
        reactions need to be rapidly initiated but are slowly
        resolved, a kinetic profile that can be understood in light
        of the relative stability of chemokine mRNAs.
        Finally, we investigated whether known 
        cis -acting mRNA motifs could account
        for the mRNA turnover rates measured in the present study.
        Adenylate-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">uridylate</NUMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (AREs) mediate rapid
        turnover of some mRNAs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> different classes of ARE have
        been defined, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which include the core motif <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUUUA</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>]. A recent bioinformatics analysis of labile mRNAs with
        AUUUA motifs extended this core motif to the nonamer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAUUUAWW</ENAMEX>, and a database of mRNAs that have matches to this
        motif in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' untranslated regions was created [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
        Using this database, we examined the distribution of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AU</ENAMEX>-rich motifs among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of mRNAs with different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">half-lives</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6shows</TIMEX> that this motif was found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preferentially</ENAMEX> in the most unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> and was observed
        with decreasing frequency in mRNAs with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer half-lives.</TIMEX>
        Nonetheless, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the genes in the long half-life
        category (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">>8 hours</TIMEX>) contained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AREs</ENAMEX>, demonstrating that
        the ARE motif is not completely predictive of rapid mRNA
        turnover. Furthermore, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> with unstable mRNAs
        lacked the ARE consensus motif, suggesting that other 
        cis -elements may be responsible for
        their rapid degradation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The systematic determination of mRNA degradation rates
        described in the present report revealed an underlying
        logic that relates gene function and mRNA stability. The
        largest category of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> found to have unstable mRNAs
        included genes that were inducible by various cellular
        signaling events. The inducibility of many of these genes
        is known to be due to transcriptional activation of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. Thus, the rapid degradation of these mRNAs
        allows their levels to rapidly drop when transcriptional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> is terminated. By categorizing genes using the
        functional properties of their encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we found
        that certain functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were relatively enriched
        for unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, the cytokine genes
        and immediate early transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor genes</ENAMEX>, were
        previously known to have unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of
        apoptosis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, however, was not previously known to
        be enriched for labile mRNAs. However, given the need to
        rapidly modulate apoptosis during development, cellular
        differentiation, and immune responses, this property of the
        apoptotic genes can be readily understood. Another
        unanticipated finding was that many critical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase of the cell cycle had rapidly degraded mRNAs. In
        light of the short duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase, these labile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> may need to be eliminated rapidly to
        allow correct entry into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> phase of the cell cycle.
        The initial impetus of this research was to understand
        the mechanism of action of the anti-cancer drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flavopiridol</ENAMEX>. The regulatory logic of mRNA degradation
        revealed in this study gives us insight into how this
        general transcriptional inhibitor can have selective
        toxicity for tumor cells. In particular, the short
        half-lives of mRNAs encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-</ENAMEX>phase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other key
        cell-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> (for example, c-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myc</ENAMEX>) may contribute
        to the cytotoxicity of flavopiridol for cancer cells but
        may also contribute to the dose-limiting toxicity of
        flavopiridol for gut epithelium, leading to secretory
        diarrhea [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. However, the present results also suggest
        that flavopiridol may be more effective in treating certain
        types of cancer cells that are highly dependent on genes
        with unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> lymphoma cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constitutively</ENAMEX> express <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-apoptotic</ENAMEX> BCL-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1 and MCL1</TIMEX>, which are not expressed at high
        levels in normal lymphocytes. The instability of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A1</TIMEX> and
        MCL1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNAs</ENAMEX> therefore may contribute to the toxicity of
        flavopiridol for these lymphoma cells. Gene expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profiling</ENAMEX> demonstrated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCI</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Ly3</ENAMEX> cell line is an
        excellent model for the activated B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtype</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. Indeed, fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lymphoma biopsies</ENAMEX> from such patients
        revealed high expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1 and MCL1</TIMEX> in most cases [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        These results suggest that activated B-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLBCL</ENAMEX> might be
        a particularly attractive candidate disease for new
        clinical trials of flavopiridol.

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 or 48 h. MTT</TIMEX> was added to the cells 2 h before
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">harvesting</ENAMEX>. Cells were lysed completely in isopropanol
          with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> hydrochloric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. The plate was read with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well spectrometer using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">570</NUMEX>-nm filter. The
          background was subtracted using a dual-wavelength setting
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">570 and 630</NUMEX> nm.
        
        
          Microarray analysis and northern blotting
          Microarray analysis was performed as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was prepared using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizol</ENAMEX> reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibco BRL</ENAMEX>)
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instruction. For each
          sample, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was used for the labeling
          reaction. All primary microarray data are available at
          our website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> micrograms of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were used for northern
          blot analysis. The probes were prepared from PCR
          amplification of the cDNA clones used for printing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lymphochip</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          The raw data from each cDNA array were normalized as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> extracted must fulfill the
          following criteria. Spot size must be ><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼m</NUMEX> and
          expression levels for all flavopiridol studies must be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">></ENAMEX>500 relative fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (RFU) for the Cy3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>0</NUMEX> RFU for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>; PBMC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> studies: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>50</NUMEX> RFU for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>.
          For the half-life studies in Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 4, 5</TIMEX>, the
          array elements (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) were selected for each of the
          indicated time points (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, X h</ENAMEX> for example) on the
          basis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> criteria. First, the mRNA abundance at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>, as measured by the ratio of the array element
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cy5/Cy3</ENAMEX>) must have decreased by at least twofold.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the average of the geometric means for the array
          element at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the later time</TIMEX> points (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Z1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Z2</TIMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Z3</ENAMEX>) must be less than the twofold decrease of that
          element at the indicated time point. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the average
          of the geometric means for previous time points (for
          example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y1 and Y2</TIMEX>) must be greater than the twofold
          decrease of that element at the indicated time point.
          The expression data for array <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> representing
          the same gene were averaged. Hierarchical clustering was
          performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> software and visualized using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tree View</ENAMEX> software [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        
        
          ARE-mRNA database
          The accession numbers of transcripts with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one to five</NUMEX>
          copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUUUA</ENAMEX> were downloaded from the ARE-mRNA
          database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. These transcripts were categorized by
          their half-lives according to the PBMC database.
        
        
          Mathematical analysis of mRNA half-lives
          A first-order kinetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> would imply that the
          log-ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX> to Cy3 would decrease linearly with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. For each gene, we fitted a linear regression model
          of the log-ratios to the time points, where the model
          included a separate intercept and coefficient term for
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>:

          [.] denotes an indicator function for
          the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, taking the values 0 or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, depending
          on whether or not that treatment drug was used for the

          estimated.
          Although each drug was allowed to have a distinct
          first-order degradation rate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were assumed to have identical error distributions
          in their assay variability. The mRNA half-life for each
          drug treatment was computed as the negative of the
          inverse of the coefficient for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>:

          Statistical analysis
          The following test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], was used to evaluate whether
          the proportion of induced genes with half-life less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h is statistically different from the proportion of not
          induced genes with half-life <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 2</NUMEX> h, for both the
