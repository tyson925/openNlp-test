        Large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> viruses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes have
        complex life cycles with several distinct phases that
        involve diverse virus-host interactions. An array of
        regulatory systems mediate activation or repression of
        expression of specific batteries of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are
        required at different phases of the life cycle. Other sets
        of regulatory genes directly interact with components of
        the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and modulate its response to the virus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. Studies on these viral regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have
        revealed a pivotal role of transcription and chromatin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in the control of gene expression and have
        contributed to the basic understanding of these processes
        in various <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 3</ENAMEX>]. Several viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> have conserved domains that are shared with
        cellular transcription factors. The classic
        helix-turn-helix (HTH)-domain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which govern the
        switch between the lysogenic and lytic pathways of
        temperate bacteriophages, and repressors containing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MetJ/Arc</ENAMEX> domain are well-known examples of such regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX> in prokaryotic virus-host <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>]. Large eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX>, such as
        poxviruses, phycodnaviruses, phaeoviruses, asfarviruses,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iridoviruses</ENAMEX> (all of which form the recently identified
        monophyletic clade of nucleo-cytoplasmic large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> viruses
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLDVs</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]), baculoviruses and herpesviruses, also
        encode a number of transcription factors. Some of these
        share domains with regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of their eukaryotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hosts</ENAMEX>, for example the FCS zinc finger and the TFIIS-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc ribbon</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Much less is known of the domain architecture and
        evolutionary history of those viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> whose cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> have not (yet) been
        identified. For example, the baculovirus repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding proteins</ENAMEX> that may
        regulate both viral and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> transcription or chromatin
        structure, but no homologs, cellular or otherwise, have
        been identified for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>]. The
        regulatory proteins of the poxviral variola <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D6R/Shope</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fibroma</ENAMEX> virus N1R <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have been shown to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        probably regulate apoptosis of the host cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. All
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> contain a conserved amino-terminal domain,
        for which no homologs outside this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have as yet been
        reported. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> additionally contain a
        carboxy-terminal RING finger domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], and some of them
        also contain a single-stranded nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding CCCH
        domain between the amino-terminal domain and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RING</ENAMEX>
        finger.
        During the comparative analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> viruses of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLDV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], we observed that the amino-terminal
        domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D6R/N1R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and baculoviral Bro-family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have a wide range of homologs in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> viruses
        and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>. Typically, these domains were
        identified in multidomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that additionally
        contained several previously undetected, evolutionarily
        mobile domains occurring in different contexts. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> suggested the existence of a common,
        previously <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncharacterized</ENAMEX> set of regulatory proteins
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">domains</NUMEX>) encoded by numerous eukaryotic and bacterial DNA
        viruses, as well as some of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genomes.
        To gain a better understanding of the functions and
        evolution of these regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we initiated a
        detailed analysis of their sequences using
        position-specific-score matrix searches, sequence-structure
        threading, secondary-structure prediction and structure
        comparisons. Here we describe the functional predictions
        and evolutionary history of these viral regulatory proteins
        and their cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> that were detected as a result
        of these analyses. The comparison of the domain
        architectures of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> points to a major general
        role for combinatorial shuffling of a small set of domains
        in the evolution in transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> and bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain in diverse
          viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and its potential relationship to APSES
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> domains
          To determine the evolutionary affinities of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D6R/N1R amino-</ENAMEX>terminal regions, we initiated a PSI-BLAST
          search of the non-redundant (NR) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> database
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>), which
          was seeded with the sequence of the corresponding region
          from the variola virus D6R <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This search not only
          recovered homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from almost all poxviral
          proteomes, but also previously undetected homologs from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chilo</ENAMEX> iridescent virus, a variety of
          γ-proteobacterial temperate phages (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KilA</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BPP1</ENAMEX>), and chromosome-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          Neisseria meningitidis, Xylella
          fastidiosa, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella paratyphi</ENAMEX> and 
          Clostridium difficile (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). The presence of this conserved region in the
          amino terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BPP1 KilA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, which is
          involved in killing the host cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], with another
          distinct conserved carboxy-terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>),
          suggests that this region is a mobile domain that is
          present in different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in independent contexts.
          Accordingly, this domain was named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> (terminal)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> shown to contain the
          KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> domain, it occurs at the extreme amino terminus
          accompanied by a wide range of distinct carboxy-terminal
          domains other than the RING finger or CCCH domains that
          are seen in the poxviruses (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2and</TIMEX> see below).
          PSI-BLAST searches seeded with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domains from
          a diverse set of viral and bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> also
          consistently recovered fungal transcription factors that
          are involved in cell-cycle-specific gene expression and
          filamentation, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>values of borderline statistical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">significance</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>). These hits precisely mapped to
          the APSES <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain, which is shared by a range
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>-specific transcription factors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBP1p</ENAMEX>,
          SWI4p, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PHD1p and SOK2p</TIMEX> from 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
          Stunted A from 
          Aspergillus nidulans [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. For
          example, a search initiated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain of 
          Pseudomonas phage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D3</ENAMEX> Orf11
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi:9635595</ENAMEX>) recovered the APSES domain of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MBP1p</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> in iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reciprocal</ENAMEX> searches with the
          profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains, similarly recovered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>
          domain with borderline E-values. As an example, a profile
          seeded with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MBP1p</NUMEX> APSES domain and including all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains in the NR database detects the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> meningitidis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> NMA1544
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi:11290039</ENAMEX>) with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1</NUMEX> in iteration 3.
          Given the availability of the three-dimensional structure
          of the APSES domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MBP1p protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>], we
          investigated this potential relationship using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>
          domain sequences for sequence-structure threading of the
          PDB database with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 3DPSSM</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIPRED</ENAMEX> and combined-fold
          prediction algorithms. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3DPSSM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIPRED</ENAMEX> gave hits
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 0.05</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3DPSSM</TIMEX> and probability of
          matching <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 0.8</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSIPRED</ENAMEX>) that implied a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> certainty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain adopting the same fold
          as the APSES domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1bm8/1bm1</ENAMEX>). Additionally, the
          3DPSSM <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">threading</ENAMEX> also suggested that the LAGLIDADG
          endonuclease domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>value <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80%</NUMEX>
          certainty) shared a common fold with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          Threading with the combined-fold prediction algorithm
          also gave the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">MBP1p</NUMEX> APSES domain as the best hit with a
          very high Z-score (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>), suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> was highly likely to adopt the same fold as the
          APSES domain.
          Secondary-structure prediction using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jpred</ENAMEX> method
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], with a multiple alignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain
          used as the input, pointed to an α + β fold with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          conserved strands and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> conserved helices.
          This predicted secondary structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain,
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-to-tail dyad of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-β</NUMEX>-strand-α-helix unit
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>), is identical to the secondary structure seen
          in the conserved core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains. Structural
          comparisons using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DALI</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], indicated that
          the core fold shared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains is
          more distantly related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> site-specific DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonucleases</ENAMEX> and the amino-terminal domain of the tRNA
          splicing endonucleases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX> domain) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
          Three-dimensional superpositions of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of these
          domains for which structures are available aligned the
          C-α atoms with a root-mean-square deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2Å</NUMEX> or
          less for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 60</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. A search with the
          APSES domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1bm8</ENAMEX>) using the VAST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]
          detected significant structural alignments with both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX> domains ( 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10 -4</NUMEX>). The
          structural similarity between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX> domain and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> nuclease domain has been previously noted [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>], but the connection of both of these with the APSES
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> has not been reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">before</TIMEX> to our knowledge. We
          noticed, however, that, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX> domain is
          related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> endonucleases, the active-site
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are not preserved in the former, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX>
          domain probably functions as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain rather
          than a nuclease. These observations suggest that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TEN domains</ENAMEX>, together with the
          KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> domain, define a novel nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding fold
          with a conserved (β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 α</NUMEX>) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> core (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). Previously, it had
          been proposed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains were related either
          to the winged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTH</ENAMEX> or to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17, 24</TIMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> are not,
          however, recovered in any sensitive sequence-profile or
          structural similarity searches. A direct comparison of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> also showed that the only domains that
          share a similar topology and conformation with the APSES
          domain are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX> domains. This implies
          that the previously proposed relationships for the APSES
          domain are unlikely to represent the true evolutionary
          connections.
          A comparison of the multiple alignment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains showed that several characteristic
          hydrophobic/aromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were conserved between the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>), suggesting that they have
          similar functional properties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains
          principally bind specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences associated with
          regulatory regions of numerous genes expressed in the G1
          to S transition of the cell cycle in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>]. The
          sequence relationship with the APSES domain, taken
          together with the evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding by the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">D6R/</ENAMEX>N1R
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain is a
          previously undetected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain that is
          prevalent in the viral world. This prediction was also
          supported by the evidence from mutations to the conserved
          KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> domain of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">N1R</TIMEX> that affected the localization of
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> virus
          maturation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (virus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
          The phyletic patterns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains
          have interesting implications for the origin of the
          fungal transcription factors. Unlike several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding
          domains conserved throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eukaryotes</TIMEX>, such as the
          homeodomain, the bHLH, bZip, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C2H2 zinc</ENAMEX> finger and the RFX
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains are restricted to fungi [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>].
          Their closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domains, which are
          widespread in diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX> and prophage
          derivatives from bacterial genomes. This suggests that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains probably emerged early in fungal evolution
          from a viral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>-like precursor that was acquired by
          the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. An alternative scenario, that the viral
          KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> domains were acquired from the fungal APSES
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, is also imaginable. This appears less likely,
          however, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> domains show limited sequence
          diversity in the fungi, compared with the much greater
          sequence diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain in a wide range
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX> that had probably already diverged by the
          time fungi emerged (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). Furthermore, the viral
          provenance of the APSES-like domains is analogous to the
          recruitment of the transposon-derived BED-finger domain
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle-specific transcription factors such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BEAF-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DREF</ENAMEX> in the arthropods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Both viruses and
          transposons are likely to derive selective advantages by
          evolving transcription factors that regulate their genes
          in response to the host cell cycle. Hence, from the above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX>, it is not unlikely that the host cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-opt the transcription factors of their genomic
          parasites for their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle-specific gene
          expression.
          The potential higher-order structural relationship
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domains with the LAGLIDADG
          site-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA endonucleases</ENAMEX> and tRNA endonuclease
          amino-terminal domains has interesting implications for
          their evolutionary affinities and origin. A structural
          comparison of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> indicates that the nuclease
          active site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> domains is contained in a
          specific amino-terminal α-helical extension packed
          against the core (β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 α</NUMEX>) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> domain common to all these proteins
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX>-terminal
          domains lack the equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the specific
          active-site extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> nucleases,
          suggesting that the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> do not possess
          nuclease activity. Thus, it appears plausible that these
          domains evolved from an ancestral nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding
          module that, on one hand, gave rise to the nucleases
          through the acquisition of an amino-terminal helical
          extension that provided the active site, and on the other
          hand, diversified into distinct nucleic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domains that are mainly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> endonucleases
          are predominantly encoded by mobile genetic elements [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. Just as the APSES domain appears to be a derivative
          of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain captured by the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TEN domains</ENAMEX> appear to have been derived through the
          ancient cellular capture of an inactive LAGLIDADG-like
          domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. The common ancestor of this fold might have
          emerged in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile genomic</ENAMEX> symbiont or parasite and
          subsequently spread widely across viral and transposon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Conserved domains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro</ENAMEX> proteins
          The baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bro proteins</ENAMEX> are encoded by a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multigene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and represent another class of
          virus-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> whose evolutionary
          affinities are not yet understood. The typical Bro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have been experimentally investigated are
          BroA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BroC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BroD</ENAMEX> from 
          Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis
          virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BmNV</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In addition to baculoviruses, we
          observed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLDV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class members</ENAMEX>, such as poxviruses
          and iridoviruses, also encoded homologs of the Bro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> such as FPV124 from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fowlpox</ENAMEX> virus and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by the entomopoxvirus AMV
          showed similarity only to the carboxy-terminal part of
          the baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bro proteins</ENAMEX>, whereas, on their amino
          terminus, they contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In
          contrast, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">entomopoxvirus proteins</ENAMEX>, such
          as MSV226 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AMV262</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMV</ENAMEX>, showed similarity
          only to the amino-terminal part of the baculovirus Bro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Yet another set of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as
          MSV194 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSV</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ORF117</TIMEX> from the phaeovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESV</ENAMEX>, and
          baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BroE of BmNV</ENAMEX>, combine the
          region homologous to the amino-terminal segment of the
          typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with another distinct domain that
          occurs in a stand-alone form in the phage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T5</ENAMEX> ORF172
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This suggests that the typical Bro proteins
          contain distinct amino- and carboxy-terminal domains
          (Bro-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-C</ENAMEX>, respectively) that are present
          independently of each other and in distinct contexts in a
          variety of other viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. To uncover their entire
          range of diversity, we initiated PSI-BLAST
          sequence-profile searches, seeded separately with the
          sequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro</ENAMEX>-C domains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro</ENAMEX>-C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> was essentially restricted to the eukaryotic
          viruses of the baculovirus and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLDV</ENAMEX> classes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain was more widely
          distributed, occurring in a stand-alone form or combined
          with other domains in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from temperate phages that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infect Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and 
          Myxococcus xanthus , and proteins
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in the genomes of proteobacteria and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P22</NUMEX> antirepressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          which regulates phage transcription [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>], is one of
          the previously characterized bacteriophage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain was observed.
          Studies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BmNV BroA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> have shown that it
          binds <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with high affinity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BmNV</ENAMEX>-infected cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Additionally,
          it has been shown that the DNA-binding determinants of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BroA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> map to the amino-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          that correspond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain defined above [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
          Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain appears to define a distinct
          superfamily of widespread viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Multiple alignment</ENAMEX>-based secondary-structure prediction
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain reveals a core with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-to-tail
          units of a β-hairpin followed by an α-helix (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain adopts an α + β fold; furthermore,
          the pattern of predicted secondary-structure elements was
          similar to that seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain and its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The multiple alignment shows that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domains contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> highly conserved aromatic
          or hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the second</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> conserved strands, a pattern that is reminiscent
          of similarly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and APSES
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). However, sequence profile searches do
          not detect any significant similarity between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domains. The sequence-structure threading with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3D</NUMEX>-PSSM method recovered the APSES domain structure
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1bm8/1bm1</ENAMEX>) as the best hit for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain,
          albeit with statistically insignificant E-values. Thus,
          given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domain is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain, it
          appears plausible that it adopts a fold similar to that
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domain, although sequence analysis and
          threading methods failed to provide strong support for
          this.
        
        
          Extensive lineage-specific expansion and domain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shuffling</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro</ENAMEX> domains
          There are several analogies between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and
          Bro-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> domains in terms of phyletic patterns, intragenomic
          distribution and domain architectures. Both these domains
          are widely prevalent in bacteriophages, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
          large eukaryotic viruses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLDV</ENAMEX> and baculovirus
          classes. Both of them show expansions in particular viral
          genomes, for example KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FPV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> in certain
          baculoviruses, and the entomopoxvirus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSV</ENAMEX>. Phylogenetic
          tree construction for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domains using
          the least-squares and maximum-likelihood methods showed
          that multiple versions of these domains from a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> typically grouped together, to the exclusion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from other genomes (data not shown). Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domains probably have undergone
          lineage-specific expansions through amplification of a
          single ancestral gene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding multiple copies
          of these domains do not necessarily occur in close
          proximity in the corresponding genomes, indicating that
          duplications were accompanied by extensive genome
          rearrangement resulting in dispersion of the paralogous
          genes.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domains show additional
          parallels in the domain architectures of the
          corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Both domains almost always are
          located at the amino termini of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and most
          often are fused to another distinct domain at the
          carboxyl terminus (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). On many occasions, the
          Bro-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domains are fused to the same
          carboxy-terminal domains (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), such as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bro-C</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T5ORF172</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-C</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mx8P63-C</TIMEX> domains.
          Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domains show specific combinations
          with certain domains, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTH</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vsr</ENAMEX>-superfamily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endonuclease</ENAMEX>. These architectures suggest that both the
          KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> modules are, to a large extent,
          functionally equivalent and probably act as the principal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding moiety that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> a specific activity
          purveyed by their carboxy-terminal domains to the target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>. These carboxy-terminal modules may be
          enzymes, such as the nuclease domains, or might mediate
          additional, specific interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Thus, the principal function of these proteins
          appears to be transcriptional regulation of viral or host
          genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, these proteins
          include antirepressors from phages such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BPP22</ENAMEX>, BPVT2
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BP933W</TIMEX>.
          The majority of the domains with which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and
          Bro-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> combine in multidomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by temperate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacteriophages</ENAMEX> and large eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX> (the
          exceptions are a few domains that are common in cellular
          proteomes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCCH</ENAMEX> and RING finger). In order
          to identify the entire repertoire of domains involved in
          these domain-shuffling events, we systematically explored
          all domains that combined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> and compiled a list of domains with which the
          latter combined in other multidomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>). This information is represented as a directed
          graph in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX>, in which each vertex corresponds to a
          particular domain and the edges connect domains that
          combine to form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multidomain proteins</ENAMEX>. The entire network
          consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> domains, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> domains
          show by far the greatest number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 and 7</TIMEX>,
          respectively) compared to other domains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RHA</ENAMEX>,
          φ31ORF238-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MSV199</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX>, while less versatile in
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>, tend to combine with the same domains,
          and in the same orientation, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> (Figure
          2b), which suggests an analogous function, such as DNA
          binding.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We show here that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KilA-N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bro-N</ENAMEX> domains are two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains that are widespread in large DNA
        viruses infecting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes. At least the
        former, and perhaps even the latter, appear to belong to a
        large class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic-acid</ENAMEX>-binding domains that includes
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APSES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAGLIDADG</ENAMEX> endonuclease and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEN</ENAMEX> domains. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungus</ENAMEX>-specific transcription factors containing the APSES
        domain appear to have evolved through capture of a viral
        KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-like precursor early in fungal evolution. KilA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and
        Bro-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> combine with overlapping sets of
        carboxy-terminal domains, which, in turn, combine with
        several additional domains, resulting in an extensive
        network of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> domains that are predominantly specific to
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA viruses</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> domains acquired by these viruses
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genomes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>). These observations
        establish a major role for shuffling within a limited set
        of domains during evolution of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The non-redundant (NR) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> was
        searched using the BLASTP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Profile searches
        were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program with either a
        single sequence or an alignment used as the query, with a
        profile-inclusion expectation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>,
        and were iterated until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>]. If
        whole-length <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were used, the searches were carried
        out using the composition-based statistics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] in order
        to prevent the detection of spurious matches that could
        arise from low-complexity segments in the query or target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In searches carried out with just the globular
        domain of a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, the composition-based
        statistics was not used because this helps in improving the
        sensitivity of searches without a major risk of corruption
