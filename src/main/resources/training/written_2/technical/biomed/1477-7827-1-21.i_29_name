        The rate of reproductive development and the onset of
        fertility are influenced by an array of environmental
        factors that can be broadly grouped as physical,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX>, and social [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Chief among social cues in
        mammals are priming pheromones that can retard or
        accelerate sexual development within constraints of factors
        such as photoperiod and nutritional status of the
        individual. Subsequent to early studies that established
        the pheromonal qualities of male urine to synchronize
        estrous cycles of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , sexual maturation
        in female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was shown to be accelerated by male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pheromones</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and retarded by female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pheromones</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        Pheromonal induction of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus in juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        has been reported in a variety of other mammals including
        prairie voles [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , and opossums [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        The gray short-tailed opossum ( 
        Monodelphis domestica ), a small
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) marsupial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> to scrub forests of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southeastern Brazil</ENAMEX>, provides new opportunities for study
        of olfactory communication and pheromonal activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX> lack an estrous cycle and anestrous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are dependent upon direct contact with a
        non-volatile male pheromone for induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Hormonal control of scentmarking and sexual behavior of
        this species (hereinafter, opossum) has been described in
        some detail [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estrus</ENAMEX> is induced when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        nuzzle scentmarks from the androgen-dependent suprasternal
        (chest) gland [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . Nuzzling delivers nonvolatile
        chemical signals to the vomeronasal organ (VNO) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and
        surgical removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">VNO</ENAMEX> prevents induction of estrus by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scentmarks</ENAMEX> alone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , although cautery ablation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNO</ENAMEX> fails to prevent ovarian activation and ovulation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> that are caged with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult males</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . While
        anestrous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are reliant on male pheromone for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> activation, spontaneous postlactational estrus
        occurs in the absence of direct contact with male pheromone
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproductive</ENAMEX> activation and the onset of estrus are
        monitored by cytology of the urogential sinus (UGS) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX>
        ] , the sexual receptive organ in marsupials that lies
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caudal</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paired lateral vaginal canals</ENAMEX> (LVC) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). UGS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrus</ENAMEX> (estrus, hereinafter) is evident after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-10 days</TIMEX> of
        pheromonal exposure. Estrous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> will not ovulate
        unless paired with a male [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , but copulation is not
        required to stimulate ovulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females caged</ENAMEX> with males
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 17</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copulation</ENAMEX> typically occurs on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the second night</TIMEX>
        of paring [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Litters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 8</NUMEX> young are born after
        a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-day</TIMEX> gestation, and young are weaned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of
        age.
        The onset of puberty in female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opossums</ENAMEX> is strongly
        influenced by pheromonal and, perhaps, other social cues.
        An earlier study found that juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> isolated from
        all adult stimuli from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days of age</TIMEX> grew to adult size
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>) but failed to express <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">180 days</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        . In contrast, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> exposed directly to male
        pheromones by cage switching reached <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus at an
        average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 127 days</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        individually caged (i.e., isolated from male scentmarks)
        and housed in a mixed sex <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> expressed first estrus at
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">162 days</TIMEX>, on average. This suggests that age at first
        estrus varied from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">109 to 162 days</TIMEX>, depending on pheromone
        exposure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body mass</ENAMEX> at first estrus was
        remarkably close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, indicating that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puberty</ENAMEX> in opossums, as in most mammals, is dependent on
        attainment of a threshold body mass. More importantly,
        advancing the age of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus by pheromone exposure was
        accompanied by an apparent acceleration of somatic growth
        such that this critical body mass was reached at a younger
        age.
        In the present study, we compared body (somatic) growth
        and ovarian activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, nuzzling
        contact with male scentmarks (exposed) with that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        individually caged in a mixed sex <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> but isolated from
        direct contact with male scentmarks (unexposed). The study
        tested the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> exposed to male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scentmarks</ENAMEX> will have greater somatic growth and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovaries</ENAMEX> will contain developing antral follicles in greater
        numbers and larger in size than those found in ovaries from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> of the same age exposed only to the ambient social
        stimuli of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. Circulating levels of estradiol and
        mass of reproductive organs were also measured as evidence
        of reproductive activation.

          Incidental transfer of pheromones in male scentmarks to

          This study utilized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> timepoints identified in
          previous studies as key stages in pheromonal induction of
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus in juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>:
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">109 days</TIMEX> - the youngest age recorded for pheromonal
          induction of estrus
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">127 days</TIMEX> - the average age of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus in
          juveniles exposed to male pheromone
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX> - the recognized age for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use in routine
          breeding and litter production, i.e. the age at which
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> will respond to male pheromone with
          expression of estrus
          Unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were isolated from direct contact
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and male scentmarks and randomly selected for

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were given continuous

          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX> provided a basis for evaluating the effects
          of male pheromone on somatic growth and reproductive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> during pheromonal induction of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus in
          exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. Exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were only examined
          through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX> because we expected they would have
          attained sexual maturity and expressed first estrus by
          then [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , making them developmentally comparable to
          unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX>.
          Scentmarks, containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrus</ENAMEX>-inducing pheromone, were
          collected by rubbing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> sides of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-ml</NUMEX> glass vial on the
          suprasternal gland of an unrelated male. The vial was
          then inverted and screwed into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stand</ENAMEX> and placed daily
          in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX>'s cage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Females</ENAMEX> actively nuzzle

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> were collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac puncture</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necropsy</ENAMEX> and the plasma stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20°C</TIMEX>. Final body mass
          and total body length were also recorded at this time.
          Ovaries, uteri, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LVC</ENAMEX> were removed, trimmed of
          connective tissue, weighed, and fixed in phosphate
          buffered formalin. Fixed ovaries were embedded in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paraplast R</ENAMEX>, cut into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> μm serial sections, mounted on
          slides, and stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lillie's Allochrome</ENAMEX> stain.
          All histological sections of both ovaries collected at
          necropsy were examined for antral follicles, which were
          recognized by the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more fluid-filled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cavities</ENAMEX> lined with granulosa cells. Atretic follicles
          were identified by the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> or more pyknotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> in granulosa cells, leukocytes in the antrum, and
          loosening or degeneration of the mural layer of granulosa
          cells. Antral follicles not exhibiting these obvious
          indications of atresia were classified as developing. The
          proportion of total antral follicles per female that was
          atretic was used as an index of atresia (atresia,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hereinafter</ENAMEX>). The diameter of each antral follicle was
          recorded as the average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> perpendicular diameters
          measured at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10X</NUMEX> with an ocular reticle in the section
          containing the oocyte nucleolus or the largest oocyte
          nucleus. Mean diameters of developing and atretic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follicles</ENAMEX> per individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> were the basis for
          comparison between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          Estradiol concentrations in plasma were measured with

          Heterogeneity of subclass error variance was assessed
          using a likelihood ratio test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was

          allows for the direct representation of heterogeneity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> (hence the name <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Generalized Least-Squares - GLS</ENAMEX>)
          and, therefore, does not require transformation of the
          dependent variable to restore homogeneity of variance, as
          is necessary for ordinary least-squares methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> 
          a priori contrasts were used for

        exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> weighed more than unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> at both
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">105 days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). None of the
        unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> expressed estrus during the study, even
        though <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> weighed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 60</NUMEX> g at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Body mass</ENAMEX> and total body length increased with age in
        both exposed and unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, but growth was faster
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> exposed to male pheromone from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>. Exposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">females</ENAMEX> gained more body mass than unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> +

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Growth curves for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> monitored until
        necropsy at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX> revealed more rapid growth in exposed
        than in unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">115 days</TIMEX>, with differences
        in body mass evident (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>) by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">123 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        The number of developing antral follicles per female
        exceeded those that were atretic in all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        in the study. The average diameter of developing and
        atretic follicles within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was similar (data not
        shown). Overall, follicular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">atresia</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>
        and did not differ with age or pheromone exposure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> >
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>). Therefore, data are reported for developing antral
        follicles only. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follicles</ENAMEX> apparently first reach the antral
        stage in unexposed juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>, because
        antral follicles were observed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        females examined at this age. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        atretic follicles and the other had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> developing follicles.
        The average number of developing antral follicles in
        unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.8 ± 1.7</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">105 days</TIMEX> (P
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17.7 ± 2.6</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX> but did not differ
        by pheromone exposure within these age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Mean follicular diameter in unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> increased
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 105 and 130 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>), but overall (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX>), the age-related increase in size was relatively
        small. Pheromone exposure was associated with increased
        follicle size at both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">105 and 130 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Also, the size distribution of follicles in exposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX> was markedly different from that
        observed in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">550 μm</NUMEX> or
        larger. Plasma estradiol concentrations were low (< <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pg/ml</ENAMEX>) in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. Mean concentrations per group
        varied from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.4 ± 2.0 to 11.3 ± 3.4</NUMEX> pg/ml but did not
        differ by age or pheromone exposure. The highest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">21.7 pg/ml</ENAMEX>) was measured in plasma from an
        estrous female with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> large (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">> 650 μm</ENAMEX>), developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follicles</ENAMEX>.
        The effect of male pheromone on sexual maturation was
        most apparent in the increased size of uteri and LVC
        collected from exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. Mean uterine mass was
        higher in exposed than unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX> (P
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LVC</ENAMEX> of exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were larger at
        both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">105 and 130 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 1, 4</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        This study demonstrates that exposure of juvenile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> to pheromone from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, the male
        suprasternal gland, accelerates ovarian follicular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the more interesting
        findings of this study is that the size distribution of
        developing follicles in unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> remained
        relatively stable from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX>, seldom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exceeding 450 μm</ENAMEX> in diameter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The pattern was
        distinctly different in exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX> wherein
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34/71</NUMEX>) of the follicles exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> μm in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diameter</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> were larger than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> μm, similar to the
        largest antral follicles (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.67 mm</NUMEX>) in superovulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opossums</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . This increased size of developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follicles</ENAMEX> in exposed opossums is similar in magnitude to
        that seen in the pre-Graafian follicles of rats between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diestrus</ENAMEX> and proestrus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Prepubertal</ENAMEX> pine voles
        exposed to male urine also showed an increase in the number
        of largest follicles, but with no change in atresia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ]
        , as in our study.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Juvenile females</ENAMEX> in this study were exposed to male
        scentmarks from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 90 days</TIMEX>, but they did not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> first estrus until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX>, much longer than the
        average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> required for pheromonal induction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. In other respects, however, first estrus
        in juveniles is similar to pheromone-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estrus</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Plasma concentrations of estradiol in opossums are
        low (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><15 pg/ml</ENAMEX>) during anestrus and are elevated (><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pg/ml</ENAMEX>) only during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">estrus</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Mean plasma estradiol
        concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 58</NUMEX> pg/ml have been reported in
        estrous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , but a gradual increase in
        circulating estradiol during pheromonal induction of estrus
        in opossums has not been described. Therefore, it is not
        surprising that estradiol concentrations measured in single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> collected at necropsy did not correlate with
        reproductive status in this experiment. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> female
        killed at estrus, however, did have the highest plasma
        estradiol concentration as well as the heaviest
        reproductive organs.
        Evidence of the stimulatory effect of male pheromone on
        sexual maturation of juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> was seen most clearly
        in the large increase in mass of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LVC</ENAMEX> and uteri of
        exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">130 days</TIMEX>, and although not reflected in
        plasma estradiol levels, classic estrogenic effects of male
        pheromone exposure are evident in the increased mass of
        these reproductive organs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juvenile</ENAMEX> and adult prairie voles
        exhibit a similar response to male stimuli. For example, a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> exposure to an adult male stimulated, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, increases in uterine mass that lasted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> or
        more [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Uterine mass also remained elevated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-4 days
        after estrus in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metestrous females</ENAMEX> in this study,
        even though their plasma estradiol concentrations were low
        at the time of necropsy.
        The mean age at estrus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127.7</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.4 days</TIMEX>, although based
        on a small sample (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), is very similar to that recorded
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">126.7 ± 2.5</NUMEX>) in our previous study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        were exposed to multiple potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of male
        pheromone, e.g. urine, feces, and scentmarks, through cage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">switching</ENAMEX>. The increased growth rate in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> suggested
        in our previous experiment was confirmed in the present
        study. Some of the increase in body mass might be due to
        estrogen-stimulated edema, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult females</ENAMEX> experience a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> gain in body mass during induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estrus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        However, an increased growth rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/wk</ENAMEX>) was evident as
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 105 days</TIMEX> in exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> who would not be
        expected to express <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus or the associated changes
        in body composition until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 130 days</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">grams</NUMEX> is confirmed as a critical body mass for
        induction of estrus in juvenile female opossums as
        identified in our previous study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Somatic growth and
        attainment of a threshold body mass or energy reserves are
        known requisites for puberty in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammals</ENAMEX> including the
        tammar wallaby [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] , and several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , but these factors seldom act
        independently of environmental factors such as photoperiod
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] or social cues [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 29</ENAMEX> ] . The opossum is unusual
        in this regard, because social cues in the form of male
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pheromone</ENAMEX> appear to stimulate both somatic growth and
        ovarian activation. Moreover, this growth response marks a
        difference between pheromonal acceleration of puberty in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opossums</ENAMEX> and that which is well-documented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, wherein
        females paired with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> ovulate at a lower body mass
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 20 g</NUMEX>) than that of isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 20 g</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] .
        Our findings provide the critical descriptive groundwork
        for further investigations into the physiological pathways
        and underlying mechanisms involved in pheromonal regulation
        of somatic and sexual maturation in opossums. The fact that
        pheromonal stimulation of both follicular and somatic
        growth was evident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 105 days</TIMEX> makes it difficult
        to say, with any certainty, whether pheromones affect these
        phenomena by independent or interacting pathways. Pheromone
        exposure activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal</ENAMEX> (HPG)
        axis as evidenced in increased plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LH</ENAMEX> in opossums [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">voles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , and ovarian activation and subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid hormone</ENAMEX> production could stimulate somatic growth
        indirectly by effects on growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> and fat deposition,
        or alterations in metabolism and appetite. Alternatively,
        in addition to stimulating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPG</ENAMEX> axis, male pheromones
        could act centrally to alter neuroendocrine control of
        growth and metabolism (e.g. via growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> releasing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hormone</ENAMEX>, thyroid hormone releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corticotrophin</ENAMEX> releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>). Future studies that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for estrogenic effects of ovarian activation, food
        availability, and body growth during the relatively
        protracted period of pheromonal induction of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> estrus
        offer promise for extending our understanding of the role
        of social and environmental signals on body growth and
        sexual maturation.
