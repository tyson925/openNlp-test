        Hospice Patients
        
          Research Questions
          Severe dyspnea, whether acute or chronic, affects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' functional status and quality of life as well
          as other psychosocial aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s life. [ 6
          ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with severe dyspnea who are in hospice care
          most often manifest the associated symptoms and problems
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>, fatigue, and sleeplessness which in turn
          affect functional status and cognitive status, and
          subsequently decrease quality of life. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] Based on
          previous studies, [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 7</NUMEX> ] a specific study aim was to
          explore the congruence of dyspnea ratings by caregivers
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' ratings of dyspnea. Another aim was to
          explore the relation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s dyspnea and related
          variables to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s quality of life as well as the
          effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caregiver</ENAMEX>'s quality of life. The study
          addressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> specific research questions in hospice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with end-stage lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregivers</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Are there significant differences in the intensity
          ratings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' dyspnea between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregivers</ENAMEX>?
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. To what extent do these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-variables, age,
          educational level, dyspnea intensity, symptom distress,
          and functional status, explain variance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          perceived quality of life?
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. To what extent do these caregiver-variables, age,
          educational level, dyspnea intensity, symptom distress,
          and mastery, explain variance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caregiver</ENAMEX>'s
          perceived quality of life.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Conceptual Framework</ENAMEX>
          The conceptual framework for this study was adapted
          from the previous work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCormick</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX>
          who that found mastery was associated with improved
          symptom management which leads to improved functional
          status and perceived quality of life. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] Another
          underlying assumption is that accurate assessment of
          symptoms leads to improved management, an assumption that
          has yet to be tested but will be the focus of a future
          study. In the present study, the perceived mastery level
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was not measured but it was assessed for
          the caregiver.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nurses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> often fail to assess dyspnea
          accurately, as they tend to assess only observable signs
          of dyspnea. Breathlessness, the subjective component of
          dyspnea, is often different from what is directly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observable</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, there have been
          a number of tools available to measure dyspnea in acute
          and chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Studies, which have measured dyspnea
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appropriately</ENAMEX>, generally use a quantitative method of
          self-assessment such as the visual analog scale or a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphic</ENAMEX> rating scale. The graphic rating scale is a
          bipolar scale with "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">0" for "No dyspnea</ENAMEX>" and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">10</ENAMEX>" for
          Worst <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dyspnea Ever</ENAMEX>." In general, a graphic rating scale
          is preferred for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, hospice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and
          those who are apt to be easily fatigued. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>'
          previous experience with the instrument has shown the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphic</ENAMEX> rating scale to be the best choice for caregivers
          in terms of ease of use and accuracy. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6</NUMEX> ]
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyspnea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospice Care</ENAMEX>
          In hospice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, it is not uncommon to find acute
          and chronic dyspnea because most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have one of
          these primary diagnoses: end-stage lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (COPD or
          interstitial fibrosis), lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, or end-stage heart
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] Aggressive treatment of distressing
          symptomatology contributes to overall quality of life and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restores</ENAMEX> to the patient some of the freedom and autonomy
          usurped by the disease process.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyspnea</ENAMEX> is often associated with other common
          symptoms: fatigue, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>, anxiety, and pain. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of symptoms is usually studied together, and
          caregivers are often asked to assess all of them using
          various types of analog or graphic rating scales. In
          planning interventions for dyspnea, it is important to
          assess the degree of distress the dyspnea causes for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and in turn the caregiver. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody</ENAMEX> and other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have found, that the onset of acute dyspnea
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have not experienced dyspnea before, may
          cause severe anxiety in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] In order to improve symptom management
          in hospice care, it is important to study whether
          caregivers are able to use the assessment tools and
          achieve ratings congruent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s ratings.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caregivers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospice Care</ENAMEX>
          Until recently, most research in psychosocial oncology
          and palliative care focused exclusively on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
          However, terminal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> are a major stressor for both
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and the family caregiver, causing a new set
          of challenges for both. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] At the very least, the
          routine of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life is altered and both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> must struggle to adjust and respond to new
          demands. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] Recent research suggests that family
          caregivers experience depression and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>,
          psychosomatic symptoms, restrictions of roles and
          activities, strain in marital relationships, and
          diminished physical health. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] Indeed, research
          suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> experience as much, if not more,
          distress than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] This emotional distress
          may affect role functioning, both within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as
          well as in society including the ability to care for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caregiver</ENAMEX> distress is an important
          concern because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> caregivers are assuming more
          responsibility for care as treatment moves increasingly
          to the outpatient arena. It is increasingly important to
          evaluate quality of life (QOL) of family caregivers
          because of their increased responsibility and
          contribution to the care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. However,
          most studies to date have focused on specific outcomes,
          such as needs, burden, and emotional distress rather than
          on a more comprehensive evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QOL</ENAMEX> outcomes.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Setting and Sample
          A large hospice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SW Florida</ENAMEX> was the site
          for the overall study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>/caregiver dyads that
          had been accrued at the time of this secondary analysis.
          This substudy was focused on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX> dyads (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54 percent</NUMEX>)
          from the sample, which were identified through the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s self-report of dyspnea at the time of
          admission. To be eligible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>) with a diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and an identified
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregiver</ENAMEX> who was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> or adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and
          both had to consent to participate. Both had to have at
          least a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> grade education, be able to read and
          understand <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and pass cognitive screening with the
          Short <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Portable Mini-mental Status Exam</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyspnea Intensity</ENAMEX>
            For <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hospice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe dyspnea and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatigue</ENAMEX>, a bipolar <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyspnea Graphic Rating</ENAMEX>
            Intensity Scale (DGRIS) was used. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] This global
            scale, which assesses only the perceived severity of
            the dyspnea, was used due to ease of administration and
            accuracy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliability</ENAMEX> and validity of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-item
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphic</ENAMEX> rating scales have been supported by a number
            of studies. Scores range from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 10</TIMEX>. Test-retest
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> has ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.89</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.92</NUMEX> and concurrent
            validity with other measures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.88</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.94</NUMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] Although
            this scale was designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> self-report, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX> also was asked to estimate the severity of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s dyspnea, using this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-item scale.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale</ENAMEX> (MSAS)
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] was
            administered to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and caregivers to measure
            both the frequency and distress of common symptoms
            experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, it was used to
            measure distress caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> symptoms commonly seen in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, including shortness of
            breath. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAS</ENAMEX> is a self-report scale that provides
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> about the occurrence of each symptom and the
            distress associated with these symptoms. Distress is
            measured on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> point summated rating scale with scores
            that may range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (no distress) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96</NUMEX> (very much
            distress). Validity was supported by high correlations
            with clinical status and quality of life. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">consistency</ENAMEX> was assessed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cronbach</ENAMEX>'s alpha and
            found to be high, ranging from r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.83</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.88</NUMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX>
            ]
            The MSAS scale was administered to all caregivers.
            It was altered slightly by rewording items to determine
            the degree to which each symptom experienced by the
            patient caused distress for the caregiver. These scores
            also ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 96</TIMEX>. This approach has been used
            previously in studies with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregivers</ENAMEX> who have
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospice Quality of Life Index</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospice Quality of Life</ENAMEX> Index (HQLI) is a
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>-item self-report tool that includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> aspects of
            overall quality of life: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Psychophysiologic Well-being</ENAMEX>;
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Functional Well-being; and Social and Spiritual</ENAMEX>
            Well-being. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] Total scores may range from a low of
            zero to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX>. Evidence of validity and
            reliability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HQLI</ENAMEX> was generated by a recently
            completed study. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] Evidence of validity was
            provided by the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HQLI</ENAMEX> to differentiate
            between hospice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and apparently healthy
            controls using both discriminate analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.00</NUMEX>) and
            comparison of means (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.00</NUMEX>). Previously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HQLI</ENAMEX> has
            been validated for use with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hospice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. The finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HQLI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores correlated</ENAMEX> at the
            expected level (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.00</NUMEX>) with functional
            status scores provides further evidence of validity.
            Finally, factor analysis confirmed the factor structure
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HQLI</ENAMEX>. Reliability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HQLI</ENAMEX> was provided by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of coefficient alphas for both total scale
            scores and subscale scores. Subscale alphas all were
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.84</NUMEX> and the total scale alpha was high for both cancer
            (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.88</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.93</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>,
            the item asking the patient how breathless he or she
            feels (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-10</ENAMEX>) was analyzed separately.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Efficacy</ENAMEX>) was
            assessed by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-item summated rating scale with a

            modified for the study to include content-specific
            stems based on the context of caregiving and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX>'s perceived ability to cope with caregiving
            tasks and manage day-to-day problems. The mastery scale
            has been used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> in a number of dyspnea
            and quality of life studies. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reliability</ENAMEX> of the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palliative Performance Status</ENAMEX> (PPS) Scale
            The purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palliative Performance Scale</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX>) is to assess the physical condition and
            functional status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> receiving palliative care.
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] Scores may range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (dead) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</NUMEX> (normal
            functioning). It is a relatively new tool based on the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky Performance Scale</ENAMEX> and is purported to provide
            a framework for measuring the progressive decline in
            palliative care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The PPS measures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> broad
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of function: intake, level of consciousness, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> is scored from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
            increments. The PPS level for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is
            determined by reading across the table at each <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decrement</ENAMEX> to find the overall best fit. 'Stronger'
            performance factors are noted to be located on the left
            of the instrument 'softer' ones on the right. Judgment
            is required if one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> factors observed in a
            particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> does not fit with the others. The
            usual approach to decide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> is to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> determine
            whether the disease has limited the ability to work or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ambulate</ENAMEX> (left side), and then work one's way across
            the table. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who have a lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> generally are
            more functionally impaired than those with higher
            scores. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prognosis</ENAMEX> is generally related to functional
            status in most palliative care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Those patients
            with higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> may have longer length of stays,
            although all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may not be comparable.
            Progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> can generally be noted with
            declining PPS levels in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Interpretation
            of the instrument may have implications about patient
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acuity</ENAMEX> and need for amount of services.
            The initial validity study assessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at
            <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">213</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to a hospice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
            Validity of this instrument was assessed comparing the
            PPS score with length of survival. The average period
            until death for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who died on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1.88 days</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> on admission, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.62 days</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>,
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6.7 days</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.3</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.87</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> or higher died in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. As part of
            an earlier project we assessed validity and reliability
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX>. The predicted strong positive correlations
            between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KFS</ENAMEX> (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.88</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX>) support
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">construct</ENAMEX> (convergent) validity. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] Although no
            reliability data were reported by the tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>,
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in this substudy found that inter-rater
            reliability was very strong (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.95</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.01</NUMEX>, df
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX>).
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demographic Data</ENAMEX>
            Standard demographic data were collected on dyads to
            allow description of the sample. Patient data included
            age, gender, education level, marital status, religion,
            occupation, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis, and length of time since
            diagnosis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on caregivers were assessed by
            self-report in a semistructured interview: age,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethnicity</ENAMEX>, gender, education, marital status, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          Study Procedures
          This study was approved by the bioethics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> of
          the hospice. Following approval by this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, the
          proposal was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of South Florida</ENAMEX>
          Institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Board</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection of Human</ENAMEX>
          Subjects. Eligible dyads that were potential study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were initially identified by hospice admission
          staff and referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>), a
          trained nursing data collector, at the beginning of each
          day. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> contacted the caregiver to arrange a visit by
          both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Health Aide</ENAMEX> (HHA). During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
          visit, the study was explained, consent of both patient
          and caregiver obtained, the mental status of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX> assessed, and the functional status of the
          patient evaluated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregivers</ENAMEX> who met the
          admission criteria were asked to complete their
          respective questionnaires independently, in separate
          rooms when possible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHA</ENAMEX> collected patient data and
          stayed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to assist as needed. The HHA
          reassured the caregiver that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> would not be
          alone while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> was collecting data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore, the caregiver was better able to concentrate
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">questionnaires</ENAMEX> knowing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHA</ENAMEX> was with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for all demographic variables and study variables
          were analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> using descriptive statistics with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.5</NUMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] Multiple correlation and paired
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-tests were used to analyze significant differences in
          ratings between caregivers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
          between related symptoms and conditions. Stepwise
          multiple regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were used to address research
          questions <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.

          Profile of Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and Caregivers
          Usable data were collected on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX> hospice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>/caregiver-dyads. A profile of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
          included in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The mean age of the hospice patient
          was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70.22 years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61.86</NUMEX> for caregivers. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 30 %</NUMEX> of
          caregivers were adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and the majority was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>. The dyad majority was white, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">African-American</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>. The majority
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were male, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX> of caregivers were
          female. There were no mean differences in cognitive
          status (SPMSQ) scores between caregivers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          The education level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12.1 years</TIMEX> compared
          to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12.8</NUMEX> for caregivers. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX> percent of
          dyad-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had annual incomes of less than
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>. Of the patient sample, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 percent</NUMEX> had lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 percent</NUMEX> colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> prostate, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34%</NUMEX> other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Of the
          caregivers, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> medical problems and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> reported a mental health problem, mostly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dyspnea Ratings and Overall Symptom Distress</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSAS</ENAMEX>)
          Mean dyspnea ratings as reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.52</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD 2.29</NUMEX>) and by the caregivers was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.39</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SD 2.93</NUMEX>).
          To address research question one, a paired, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-test was used to assess if there were significant
          differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregivers-patient</ENAMEX> dyad ratings of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s dyspnea intensity. As shown in the boxplot
          in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, results indicated that the distribution of
          scores and means were almost identical (Mean difference =
          .-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>, t = -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.53</NUMEX>, df <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.59</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paired</ENAMEX>, bivariate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> was used to determine the relationship
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and caregiver ratings of dyspnea. The
          correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and caregiver scores was weak
          but significant (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.000</NUMEX>, df <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 162</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>' mean score on the MSAS symptom distress
          scale (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), which includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> common symptoms
          experienced by hospice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, including dyspnea were
          rated at about the same level. Mean score of caregivers
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25.41</NUMEX>, compared to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25.60</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Factors <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Influencing Patients</ENAMEX>' Quality of
          Life
          To address the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> research question, a stepwise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple regression</ENAMEX> was used to determine if these
          patient-variables, age, educational level, symptom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distress</ENAMEX> (MSAS), dyspnea intensity, and functional status
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPS</ENAMEX>), explained variance in the dependent variable,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s perceived quality of life (HRQL). Variables
          were entered into the model stepwise with quality of life
          as the dependent variable (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). All variables were
          entered into the model except for age, dyspnea intensity,
          and functional status. Regression results indicated that
          symptom distress and education were the only significant
          predictors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s quality of life (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX>, p
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.04</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factors Influencing Caregivers</ENAMEX>' Quality of
          Life
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> research question was examined using
          stepwise multiple regression to determine if the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregiver</ENAMEX>'s perceived levels of mastery, symptom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distress</ENAMEX>, age, educational level, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          dyspnea intensity were significantly related to their
          perceived quality of life. All variables were entered
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with quality of life as the dependent
          variable. Results showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> variables were
          significant predictors of variance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregivers</ENAMEX>'
          quality of life (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX>): mastery, symptom
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distress</ENAMEX>, age, and education (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Dyad ratings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' dyspnea were almost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identical</ENAMEX> (paired mean difference was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.13</NUMEX>). These
        findings support other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> such as those of Sneeuw
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] who found that, with few exceptions,
        mean scores of the proxy raters were equivalent to those of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, varying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.40 and 0.60</NUMEX>, indicating a
        moderate level of agreement at the individual level.
        Disagreement was not dependent on the type of proxy rater,
        or on raters' background characteristics, but was
        influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QOL</ENAMEX> dimension under consideration and the
        clinical status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] Although our
        findings also confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-caregiver dyspnea
        ratings were not significantly different (mean difference
        -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.19</NUMEX>), the correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregiver-patient</ENAMEX> ratings
        were significant but relatively not that strong (r <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX>, p =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.000</NUMEX>, df <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 162</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were checked twice for accuracy,
        reanalyzed, and the results were identical. Why the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> is not stronger in view of the negligible mean
        difference in paired-dyad ratings is puzzling. The results
        indicate that both significant others and health care
        providers can be useful sources of information about cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QOL</ENAMEX>. Measurement of dyspnea needs to be done
        frequently using standardized instruments, such as the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-item, graphic rating scale to assess dyspnea and
        effects of treatments.
        Results of the regression analysis revealed that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s perceived symptom distress and educational level
        are the most important variables that explain variance in
        their quality of life. This finding is similar to a
        previous study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCormick</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX>. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        These results confirm the importance of assessing and
        managing the symptoms to improve or maintain quality of
        life.
      
      
        Conclusions
        From the results, it is clear that caregivers can obtain
        ratings of dyspnea that are congruent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
        perceived symptoms. This is especially important in hospice
        care as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may become so debilitated that they need
        to rely on proxy ratings from their caregivers to assess
        and attend to their symptom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> Caregiver perceived
        quality of life was related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> variables, perceived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mastery</ENAMEX>, symptom distress, age, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of education,
        with mastery being the strongest predictor. Overall symptom
        distress and education were found to be the best predictors
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s quality of life. In the current study,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mastery</ENAMEX> was tested only in the caregivers. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> found mastery to be an important predictor
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s quality of life and recommend it be
        assessed in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and caregiver. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ]
        Future research in the form of clinical trials is needed
        to test interventions to manage the severe dyspnea and
        related symptoms that occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and
        end-stage lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Therapies for dyspnea in the
        hospice setting have been subjected to only minimal
        scientific study, especially for end-stage chronic
        obstructive lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Evidence-based
        clinical guidelines such as those developed for pain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> are needed for dyspnea assessment and improved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of symptoms.
