        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the major cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphatases</ENAMEX> is protein phosphatase type 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PP1</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . An
        abundant enzyme expressed in all cells, complex regulation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> is thought to be essential for proper temporal and
        spatial regulation of PP1 catalytic activity towards
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">substrates</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> different isotypes of
        the catalytic subunit, designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1δ</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1γ1</ENAMEX>,
        are expressed in many different cell types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Studies
        employing many eukaryotic systems all point to a crucial
        role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> activity in controlling cell cycle
        progression, and an absolute requirement of this activity
        for mitotic exit [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] . There is also evidence to
        suggest that phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> and its associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by the cyclin-dependent kinases may regulate PP1
        activity in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ]
        . Hence, current efforts are directed towards
        identification of cell cycle-dependent substrates for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>,
        and how regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> activity towards these substrates
        controls the cell division cycle.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> physiological substrate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> appears to be the
        product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , a demonstrated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor. The cell growth
        and tumor suppressive activity of pRB is regulated by its
        phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. pRB phosphorylation varies as a
        function of cell cycle phase; during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> the hypophosphorylated form
        predominates, while the hyperphosphorylated form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulates</ENAMEX> during S, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> phase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . It is this
        hypophosphorylated form of pRB present during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> and mid
        G 
        1 which functions to modify gene
        expression. This is achieved by complexing with
        transcription factors resulting in repression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] or
        stimulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] of transcription. Under conditions
        favoring proliferation, the phosphorylation of pRB via
        cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-to-late</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> phase results in liberation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E2F</ENAMEX> and
        other pRB-bound transcription factors, which then activate
        the transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">S-phase genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . In late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
        phase, pRB returns to its growth suppressive,
        hypophosphorylated form due to the action of a pRB-directed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase</ENAMEX> belonging to the type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of
        serine/threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatases</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        Of critical importance is the question of the 
        in vivo effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> activity on pRB
        and growth regulation. To date, several techniques have
        been employed in this regard to demonstrate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP1</NUMEX> actions in
        intact cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berndt et</ENAMEX>. al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] used electroporation to
        introduce PP1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> into tissue culture cells having
        noted that previous genetic attempts to accomplish
        overexpression were not readily accomplished. Using this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX>, they showed a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">G1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> that was dependent
        upon the presence of pRB. In another report,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>-injection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> decreased extractability of pRB from
        nuclei, presumably by increasing dephosphorylation and
        increasing association with nuclear proteins thereby
        playing a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G1/S</ENAMEX> transition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro</ENAMEX>-injection of antibodies to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP1</NUMEX> catalytic subunit
        has been shown to block cells in metaphase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Since
        this is the time during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mitosis</TIMEX> when pRB is normally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dephosphorylated</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 24</NUMEX> ] , it is tempting to speculate
        that prevention of pRB dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP1
        activity impedes an orderly progression through mitosis,
        perhaps contributing towards a transformed phenotype.
        Here, using the tetracycline induction system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ,
        we developed an inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> expression system to
        investigate the regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> activity. We view this as
        a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step towards addressing the question of the 
        in vivo effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> activity on pRB
        and growth regulation. Our results support the notion that
        induced PP1α <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> functions identically to endogenous
        PP1α with respect to non-catalytic subunit binding and
        activity towards phosphorylase 
        a and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor pRB.
        Localization of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the nucleus also mirrors
        that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous</ENAMEX> PP1α 
        in vivo . When using this system to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">forcibly overexpress 6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX>, there is a concomitant
        decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">endogenous PP1α</TIMEX> levels, suggesting the
        existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which PP1α
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels remain constant. RT-PCR analyses of isolated
        polysome fractions supports the notion that this putative
        autoregulatory mechanism is exerted, at least in part, at
        the translational level.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LLW02F</NUMEX> cells
          Figure 1shows construct of the tetracycline-inducible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX> used to express <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure
          2A, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr incubation with doxycycline in the medium has
          no appreciable effect on endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1α protein</ENAMEX>
          expression in the untransfected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">UMUC3</NUMEX>)
          or a cell line transfected with the reverse tetracycline
          transactivator plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pUHD172-1neo</ENAMEX> only (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LLWO1</NUMEX>). A time
          course of induction by doxycycline was then carried out
          in stable clone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LLWO2F</TIMEX>. Harvested at various time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, whole-cell lysates were prepared and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were separated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE for western blotting
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to the hemagglutinin tag. As shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with the anticipated molecular
          weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> kDa was detected. A clear differential of
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> (indicated at the left of the
          panel) was observed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.5 hours</TIMEX> after addition of
          doxycycline, which became more pronounced at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX>
          points. The doxycycline-independent increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> is attributed to background expression when
          using this system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . As predicted for a protein
          under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doxycycline-inducible promoter</ENAMEX>,
          the abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> decreases in the absence of
          the inducer over time (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). Subsequent time course
          experiments revealed peak abundance occurring between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr, and remaining constant thereafter for at least
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hr</TIMEX>, at which time the experiment was terminated. As
          such, we have chosen the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hr induction time for all
          subsequent experiments to ensure peak abundance of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">induced 6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX>.
          As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>, a significant reduction in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">abundance</ENAMEX> can be observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 3 and 12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hrs</ENAMEX> following removal of doxycycline. This reduction
          continued through the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hr time</TIMEX> point at which time the
          experiment ended. Taken together, these data confirm the
          dependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tet-O/CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, thus demonstrating inducible
          expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>. As expected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , some low-level
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> in the absence of the inducer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doxycycline</ENAMEX> can also be detected.
        
        
          Biological and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biochemical Characterization</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inducible</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-</ENAMEX>PP1α
          To begin addressing the biological and biochemical
          characterization of inducible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>, we next localized
          this protein 
          in situ using immunohistochemistry.
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, there is a predominant nuclear
          localization of the hemagglutinin epitope (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A)
          compared to the low-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> and nuclear
          background reactivity seen in the uninduced LLWO2F
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B). Thus, not only can
          doxycycline-induced expression of PP1α be detected
          immunohistochemically, but localization of this protein
          appears to be identical to that of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Targeting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP1</NUMEX> to the nucleus is due in part to a
          PP1-associated nuclear targeting subunit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNUTS</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
          ). To further investigate the properties of inducible
          PP1α, we performed coprecipitation studies to determine
          if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNUTS</ENAMEX> can also be found associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX>.
          Towards this goal, a fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNUTS</ENAMEX> was
          tested for the ability to capture induced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>. Lysates
          from induced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">LLWO2F</NUMEX> cells were combined with GST-alone-
          or GST-PNUTS-loaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">glutathione</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sepharose</ENAMEX> beads.
          Following separation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE and western blotting,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to hemagglutinin was used to detect any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibody reactivity</ENAMEX> would
          indicate a link from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GST</ENAMEX> epitope to the hemagglutinin
          epitope via a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNUTS</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP1α</NUMEX> interaction. As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, the hemagglutinin epitope was captured by the
          GST-PNUTS fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, but not the GST-alone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          These data support the idea that induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX> and the
          nuclear targeting PP1-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein PNUTS</ENAMEX> can form a
          complex. These results further support the view that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">induced PP1α</ENAMEX> behaves similarly if not identically to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX>, and provides a possible mechanistic
          explanation for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> to the
          nucleus.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> different approaches were taken to address the
          biochemical activity of inducible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>. First,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocomplexed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> was tested for its ability
          to dephosphorylate phosphorylase 
          a . Phosphorylated on a single
          serine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX>, this substrate is often used to monitor
          the biochemical activity of PP1 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . As shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, greater phosphatase activity is detected in
          immunoprecipitates from induced <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LLWO2F</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysates
          compared to uninduced. This is consistent with the notion
          that inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX> is enzymatically active. Our second
          approach involved testing immunopurified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> for
          its ability to dephosphorylate the growth suppressor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein pRB</ENAMEX>. Having previously reported on the ability of
          immunocomplexed endogenous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> to dephosphorylate pRB [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] , we followed the same experimental approach. Figure
          6shows a significant decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 32P</TIMEX> radiolabel
          intensity for pRB following incubation with the
          anti-hemagglutinin immunoprecipitate compared to the
          normal mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> control immunoprecipitate. In addition,
          okadaic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, a potent inhibitor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] ,
          significantly inhibits pRB dephosphorylation in this
          reaction. Taken together, these data indicate that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducible</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX> is biochemically active.
        
        
          Upregulation of inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> coincides
          with downregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous</ENAMEX> PP1α
          One prediction would be that by increasing expression
          of the catalytic subunit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>, overall PP1-specific
          activity within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> would increase. To address this,
          we tested the phosphatase activity of LLWO2F whole-cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysate</ENAMEX> using phosphorylase 
          a as the substrate. To inhibit any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP2A</ENAMEX> activity, which can also dephosphorylate
          phosphorylase 
          a and thus interfere with PP1
          activity measurements, these assays were carried out in
          the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">okadaic acid</ENAMEX>, which does not inhibit
          PP1 activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Although reproducible, we observed
          only modest increases in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP1</NUMEX>-specific activity found in
          lysates from induced cells compared to the uninduced
          controls (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation for this
          finding is that the overall level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1α</ENAMEX> within the cell
          remains relatively constant regardless of induction.
          Indeed, a time course of induction followed by western
          blotting of whole cell lysates using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to PP1α
          revealed diminution of the endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX> signal after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          hr of induction, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> signal increased
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). To further test this hypothesis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> and western blotting experiments were
          carried out using PP1 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">isoform</NUMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. As
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, induced (approximate
          molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 kDa</NUMEX>) and endogenous (approximate
          molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37 kDa</NUMEX>) PP1α are clearly resolved by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE. As predicted, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are recognized by
          antibody specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX> when performing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> or western blotting.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1α antibody</ENAMEX> followed by
          western blotting using the same anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PP1α</NUMEX> reveals a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reciprocal</ENAMEX> relationship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX> abundance following
          doxycycline induction; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">endogenous PP1α</TIMEX> levels decrease in
          response to increasing levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> (top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>,
          compare left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>). This difference in abundance is
          more striking in the whole-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysate lanes</ENAMEX>; endogenous
          PP1α fails to be detected in lysates prepared from
          induced cells (compare middle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>). Parallel
          experiments performed using the same lysate and antibody
          to hemagglutinin for immunoprecipitation and western
          blotting show the position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> and the fact
          that endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX> is not recognized by this antibody
          (bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Western blotting for additional isoforms
          of PP1 reveals that this reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX> following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">induction</ENAMEX> is isotype-specific; when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> levels
          increase, concomitant with a decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX> levels,
          PP1δ and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1γ1</TIMEX> levels remain relatively unchanged from
          those found in uninduced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lysate</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). Taken
          together, these data suggest that an as yet undescribed
          negative-feedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for
          PP1α which contributes towards maintaining a constant
          level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression and enzyme activity.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-</ENAMEX>PP1α
          To address the possible autoregulatory mechanism(s) of
          PP1α expression and activity, we analyzed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both endogenous PP1α</TIMEX> and induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX>. For
          uninduced cells, only endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1α RNA</ENAMEX> can be found
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with polysomes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>). While
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> can be detected in the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>,
          the majority PP1α <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> detected in the total preparation
          is endogenous (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>). In contrast, it appears that
          for the doxycycline-induced cells (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>), there is
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> associated with polysomes than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1α</ENAMEX>. However, both messages appear to be
          present at the same level in the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> preparation
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> lane). This apparent preference for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-</ENAMEX>PP1α
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> association with polysomes suggest that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoregulation</ENAMEX> takes place, at least in part, at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translational</ENAMEX> level.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, we report on the development of an inducible
        mammalian cell expression system for the catalytic subunit
        of the α-isotype for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> behaves similarly if
        not identically to endogenous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX> with respect to nuclear
        localization, complex formation to a recently described
        PP1-associated nuclear targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and 
        in vitro enzymatic activity towards
        phosphorylase 
        a and the cell growth and tumor
        suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein pRB</ENAMEX>.
        We observed that endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1α protein</ENAMEX> levels decrease
        in response to increasing levels of induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-</ENAMEX>PP1α
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This observation suggests that an as yet
        undescribed negative-feedback or autoregulatory mechanism
        exists for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX> which contributes towards maintaining a
        constant level of this enzyme. Given the difficulty in
        achieving overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1 protein</ENAMEX> and activity in
        mammalian cells, this suggestion provides an attractive
        explanation. This putative mechanism appears to be
        isotype-specific, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1δ</ENAMEX> and
        PP1γ1 remained relatively unchanged in response to induced
        expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>. Precedent for an autoregulatory
        mechanism comes from a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baharians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schonthal</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] , in which they demonstrate endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP2A protein</ENAMEX>
        levels decrease in the presence of increasing amounts of
        forcibly-expressed exogenous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP2A</TIMEX>. Their report also
        provides evidence that this control is exerted at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">translational</ENAMEX> level and does not involve regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing. Using a similar approach
        of analyzing mRNA association with ribosomes as a measure
        of translation efficiency, a similar level of translational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> also appears to exist for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>. If mRNA association
        with ribosomes is truly a measure of translation
        efficiency, one conclusion from these data is that in
        doxycycline-induced cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is more
        efficiently translated than endogenous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX>. This would
        help to explain why we observed a decrease in endogenous
        PP1α <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression in doxycycline-induced cells. Since
        we did not perform rigorous analyses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1α</TIMEX> regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> processing, we cannot rule out the
        possibility that some level of transcriptional control also
        exists. Indeed, the abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous PP1α RNA</ENAMEX> found
        in uninduced cells appears equal to or greater than the
        combined abundance of endogenous and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6His-HA-PP1α</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), supporting the notion that some level of
        translational control may also exist.
        These findings, provided by the development of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducible</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> expression system, will afford new research
        opportunities aimed towards addressing the question of how
        PP1 activity is regulated. This putative autoregulatory
        mechanism for the catalytic subunit may help to explain why
        the overall abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> during the various phases of
        the cell cycle remains relatively constant [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        Historically, regulation of PP1 catalytic activity has
        resulted from associated subunits inhibiting or targeting
        the catalytic subunit towards substrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . While the
        PP1 catalytic subunit is not found alone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, such
        unassociated catalytic subunits have been shown to be
        active, at least 
        in vitro . Although speculative,
        there may be a threshold amount of catalytic subunit 
        in vivo above which associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are limiting. Such a situation may compromise the
        ability of associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to effectively regulate PP1
        catalytic activity. To guard against this scenario, control
        over the amount of PP1 catalytic subunit present via an
        autoregulatory mechanism would be beneficial.
        The data presented here validate a useful system with
        which to manipulate PP1 activity 
        in vivo for the purpose of functional
        studies. Just as is the case for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">PP2A</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , it seems
        clear that efficient overall increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PP1</TIMEX> protein
        abundance may not be achieved due to a putative negative
        feed-back or autoregulatory mechanism. However, induced
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous PP1</ENAMEX> which behaves identically to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX> while remaining physically distinguishable
        can facilitate the use of mutants to address functional
        questions, particularly in the area of cell cycle
        regulation and tumor cell growth suppression. Indeed, the
        use of a constitutively active mutant of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP1</ENAMEX> has already
        been shown to result in pRB-dependent G1 arrest in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Placing this mutant into the
        inducible expression system described here has the
        potential to down-regulate expression of wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP1</ENAMEX>. Doing so in a timed, controlled manner will
        permit 
        in vivo studies addressing PP1
        function during discrete phases of the cell cycle, and will
        be the subject of future endeavors.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Type Culture Collection</ENAMEX>. The cells were maintained in

          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> units/ml
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">penicillin</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ug</ENAMEX>/ml streptomycin. Cells were

          Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was introduced into cultured cells using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipofectamine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ug of plasmid DNA
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ul of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipofectamine</ENAMEX> were combined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ul of
          Opti-mem media (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>) and allowed to stand
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. This mixture was
          diluted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml with Opti-mem and applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in one
          well of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-well tissue culture plates. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          ml of complete medium was added to each well. After
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> the medium was replaced with complete
          medium.
          Transfection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">UMUC3</NUMEX> cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pUHD172-1neo</ENAMEX> was
          followed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hr later</TIMEX> by selection using geneticin.
          Isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were obtained at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800 μg/ml.</ENAMEX> These cells
          were passaged and expanded before transfection with
          pBI-EGFP (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>), which contains the enhanced green
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> coding sequence under control of a

          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> hr transfection (as described above) the medium

          the cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. The
          presence of doxycycline dependent green fluorescence was
          indicative of stable transfection with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pUHD172</NUMEX>-1neo
          encoding the rtTA-nls <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and transient transfection
          with pBi-EGFP. Parallel cultures were then passaged and
