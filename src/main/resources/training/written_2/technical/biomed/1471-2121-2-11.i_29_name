          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of DNA
          helicases
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Bloom syndrome</ENAMEX> (BS) is a rare <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-prone autosomal
          recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability,
          immunodeficiency, infertility and small stature [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
          BS cells have a distinctive genomic instability: a high
          frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> (SCEs) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quadriradial</ENAMEX> formation. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, the gene mutated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX>,
          encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA helicase</ENAMEX> (BLM) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. BLM
          shares the most identity in the helicase domain to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xenopus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>], to a predicted 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> CAB05609 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>],
          and to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster dmBLM [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> can
          partially complement phenotypes of mutations in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> SGS1 gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>].
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> published reports of 
          BLM <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knock-out mice</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> strategy
          used a single deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> and found that the
          homozygous null mutants are embryonic lethals [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]; the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strategy used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> and
          recovered full sized, fertile compound heterozygote <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          with an elevated incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          mouse model was made with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells that have a high
          frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCEs</ENAMEX> before injection and recapitulates the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX> phenotypes more accurately.
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other human genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecQL / RecQl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRN</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RecQ4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RecQ5</ENAMEX> [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>]. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRN</ENAMEX> is the gene mutated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Werner</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, a premature aging disorder; WS cells also show
          features of genomic instability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRN</ENAMEX> encodes an
          exonuclease activity and shares many similar in vitro
          helicase activities with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. Mutations in the 
          RECQ4 gene have been found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmund-Thomson</ENAMEX> syndrome, a rare premature
          aging and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-prone disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Previous work from
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 17, 18, 19</TIMEX>] demonstrated
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> helicase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> in vitro on a variety of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrates</ENAMEX>. Transfection of the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> cDNA (but
          not missense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> lacking helicase activity) into BS
          cells reduces the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCEs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], indicating
          that the DNA helicase activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is essential for
          genomic stability.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is localized in nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and the
          nucleolus
          The BLM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA helicase</ENAMEX> is found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct nuclear
          structures in normal human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ND10</TIMEX> or PML nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bodies</ENAMEX> (NBs) and the nucleolus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> are dynamic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX>-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depots</ENAMEX> of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> disrupted upon
          viral infection and in certain human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">malignancies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. BS cells have NBs of normal morphology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>], and cells lacking PML destabilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> and have a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fold increase in the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCEs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. NBs
          have been implicated in the regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>] although their precise function is still unknown.
          BLM expression is cell-cycle regulated, showing a marked
          increase in S phase and peaking in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G2</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>]. The
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> mRNA and protein expression coincides
          with its appearance in the nucleolus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. This report
          uses a series of inducible cell lines containing deletion
          alleles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> to investigate the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> in nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">localization</ENAMEX> and
          in the maintenance of genomic stability. We find that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain directs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> for packaging in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX>, while
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain is required for efficient nucleolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>. Compared to the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          deletions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> and mutation of the helicase
          domain have a strong negative effect on genomic stability
          whereas deletions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> have less effect.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> has in vitro <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> helicase activity
          Epitope-tagged genes facilitate the analysis of
          transfected cell lines and protein recovery. The green
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) is especially useful as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> and epitope tag due to its ease in detection and
          apparent independent folding that does not interfere with
          the activity of its fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. A GFP-BLM
          expressing recombinant baculovirus was produced in Sf9
          cells. Single virus isolates expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> were
          identified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Sf9 cells
          infected with the purified primary stocks were screened
          by immunofluorescent microscopy to verify accumulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> in the nucleus (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). This screening
          verified full length expression as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> is fused to the
          N-terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and the nuclear localization signal is
          in the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1417</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> BLM
          coding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. GFP-BLM accumulates in the nucleus
          of infected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sf9</NUMEX> cells as large aggregates (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>).
          This observation is consistent with a report of BLM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligomerization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. This property is an obstacle to
          purification as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10%</NUMEX> of the expressed GFP-BLM
          is soluble. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> was purified using ion-exchange and
          metal chelate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin chromatography</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). The
          purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-dependent ATPase activity and
          DNA unwinding activity (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1C& 1D</ENAMEX>) equivalent to
          previous preparations without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> expressed in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. GFP-BLM
          has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> units/ng unwinding activity and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> units/ng
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-dependent ATPase activity as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> units/ng
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> units/ng for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> purified from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. These data
          demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> has the same enzymatic activity
          as normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and GFP-tagged variant alleles can be used
          to discover the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Selection and analysis of transfected cell lines
          expressing normal and mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> alleles under
          doxycycline control
          An SV40-transformed BS cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GM0855B</NUMEX>) was
          transfected with a plasmid containing an expression unit
          for the tetracycline or doxycycline (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX>) responsive
          transcriptional transactivator [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> cell line
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HG2522.1</NUMEX>a) out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> showed good responsiveness (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          fold) and low uninduced background expression levels
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.25%</NUMEX> green cells). A series of deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> of the
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> cDNA (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B3</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] were constructed using
          restriction <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and oligonucleotide adapters (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were made as in frame fusion genes at the
          C-terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> and cloned behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX>-responsive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in plasmid pTRE. HG25221a cells were transfected
          with the normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and stable
          hygromycin-resistant cell lines were selected. Clones
          were picked and screened for nuclear localized green
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescence</ENAMEX> after induction. Cell lines expressing each
          construction were chosen for further study when the
          background level of green cells was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> and the
          percentage of green cells after induction was
          reproducibly elevated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          GFP-BLM expression can be regulated by inducer
          concentration
          The level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> produced with increasing amounts
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX> after a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> induction period was determined
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> was calculated
          relative to the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> present in a normal
          SV40-transformed fibroblast line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GM0637B</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tet</ENAMEX>
          concentrations from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> μg/ml produced levels of
          stable GFP-BLM expression in this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SV40</NUMEX>-transformed BS
          cell line similar to the amount found in the control cell
          line. Based on these data <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 μg/ml</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> were used
          as the standard induction conditions to evaluate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> frequency of the transfected cell
          lines.
        
        
          Stable cell lines containing the mutant proteins
          are inducible with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX> and show altered
          localization
          The cell lines chosen for study contain some
          constitutive expression of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> alleles but show good
          reproducible induction (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>). The localization of the
          normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was analyzed by
          immunofluorescent microscopy (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Antibodies
          against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> and topoisomerase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIα</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] were used as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX>. A human autoimmune serum
          against a nucleolar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen ANA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> was used for nucleolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-localization</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The cell line
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> alone showed diffuse nuclear and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> green fluorescence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). The normal
          GFP-BLM fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> localizes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> and the nucleolus
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>) as previously reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> in normal
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> co-localizes
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4B& 4C</ENAMEX>) as does normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 33, 34</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> is distributed
          throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nucleolus</ENAMEX> except for several central
          regions that appear as holes in the images. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> show little NB localization
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ΔN1 through ΔN3</TIMEX> retain the nucleolar localization
          pattern (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4D</TIMEX>,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔN4</NUMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> shows
          mostly diffuse localization but nucleolar localization is
          still evident (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4H</NUMEX>). In <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> or more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in
          the induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> there is little co-localization
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> or TOPIIIα (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4D</TIMEX>,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These
          results demonstrate that the normal GFP-BLM fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> restores the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> nuclear localization pattern to
          this BS cell line and deletions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> affect
          the packaging of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N2-N4</ENAMEX> regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> are required for NB
          localization
          By visual inspection each induced cell line contains
          cells expressing different levels of the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔN1</NUMEX> expressing cells which exhibit the most intense
          green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fluorescence</ENAMEX> comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> cells out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
          counted) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and show co-localization of
          the GFP signal with α-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> and α-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TopIIIa</ENAMEX>. This small
          number of cells is identical to cells expressing normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4B& 4C</ENAMEX>). The cell lines expressing
          ΔN2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ΔN3 and ΔN4</TIMEX> do not show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> localization (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> out of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> cells). Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ΔN1 protein</ENAMEX> shows partial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-localization with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">N1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is not absolutely
          required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> to be localized there. The other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domains are required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> localization.
        
        
          The helicase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> have
          very different effects compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          mutations
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> GFP-fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with mutations in the
          helicase domain have different localization patterns. The
          K695T <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">missense protein</ENAMEX> localizes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX>, but less
          efficiently than normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, and to the nucleolus with an
          altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphology</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4I</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K695T</NUMEX> fusion protein
          is not evenly distributed throughout the outer nucleolar
          region but shows areas of concentration and larger
          central holes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔH1</NUMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has a diffuse
          localization pattern throughout the nucleus and has a
          distinct altered nucleolar localization (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4J</NUMEX>). This
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> appears in the central holes of the
          nucleolus where the normal fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is not found.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-localization of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H1</NUMEX> fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and α-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> and
          TOPHI11α is seen in most cells, and fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NBs</ENAMEX> are
          present. The GFP-fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with helicase mutations
          are packaged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> and have altered nucleolar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">localization</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> GFP-fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations
          have different localization patterns than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ΔC 1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ΔC2 fusion proteins</ENAMEX> co-localize
          efficiently with α-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> and α-TOPIII (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4K& 4L</ENAMEX>)
          and have little nucleolar localization. In addition the
          C-terminal deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> form numerous small green
          nuclear bodies that do not co-localize with either NB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBs</ENAMEX>). These BBs are found in cells
          expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ΔN3</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">K695T proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure 4H&
          4I). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBs</ENAMEX> may be due to formation of large oligomers
          or aggregates of less soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fusion proteins</ENAMEX>. The
          significance of these aggregates is unknown. These
          observations demonstrate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> localization and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          domain is required for accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleolus</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The mutant fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are made as stable
          full-length proteins
          The differences in localization pattern between the
          normal and mutant alleles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is not due to vastly
          different levels of stable fusion protein expression.
          Western analysis showed that all of the GFP fusion genes
          are inducible and are made as full-length proteins
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion fusion proteins do
          not fail to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> because of reduced fusion protein
          expression in these cell lines. They are expressed as
          stable full length fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at levels close to
          those of the normal GFP-BLM fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I</ENAMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ΔN2 protein</ENAMEX> is relatively over-expressed
          under the induction conditions used, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔN3</NUMEX> and
          ΔN4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are expressed at near normal levels under
          the same induction conditions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion
          alleles have higher levels of constitutive expression
          relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations and have overall
          higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression; one explanation is
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations are deleterious.
        
        
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal mutations have little effect on
          genomic stability as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> frequency
          BS cells have an elevated frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCEs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. This
          increase in homologous recombination leads to an
          increased somatic mutation frequency and genomic
          instability. The SCE frequency was assayed in the
          inducible cell lines (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, Tables 2& 3</ENAMEX>). The
          cell line expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> alone had a nearly identical
          frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCEs</ENAMEX> with and without induction (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">65</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
          exchanges per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> chromosomes). The GFP-BLM cell line had
          an elevated baseline level (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>) but showed
          significant reduction upon addition of inducer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 to 12</NUMEX>
          exchanges). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔN1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ΔN2 and ΔN3</TIMEX> cell lines showed less
          reduction (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17-23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>) and slightly higher baseline
          levels (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47-58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>). These cell lines also have a
          distribution of SCEs slightly elevated relative to normal
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔN4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line has a different
          distribution and shows less correction of the SCE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> show a gradual increase in the range of the SCEs
          as the deletions approach the helicase domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        
        
          The helicase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations have a
          destabilizing effect
          The helicase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations have a greater
          effect on genomic stability than do the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2& 3</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6A</NUMEX>). There is a
          polarity of loss of function seen across the gene from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6A& 6B</ENAMEX>).
          Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations appear to have a
          dominant negative effect, as the frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCEs</ENAMEX> is
          higher with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX> than without. The most dramatic effects
          are seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ΔC1</TIMEX> and to a lesser degree in the ΔC2
          induced cultures, as evidenced by an elevated frequency
          of ring chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6C</NUMEX>). This may
          indicate breakage and rejoining events or tangled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeres</ENAMEX>. The cell line containing the helicase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletion</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ΔH1</TIMEX>, has an elevated basal frequency of SCEs
          and a higher chromosome number than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> control cell
          line (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>) yet does not appear to be as deleterious
          as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">K695T</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal deletions are when comparing
          relative SCE events. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> analysis of this cell line
          was complicated by difficulty in finding chromosome
          spreads and by the small number of metaphases present in
          the cultures. Many of the metaphases could not be
          counted, as the chromosomes did not separate under the
          optimized spreading conditions that worked efficiently
          for the other cell lines. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> assay is therefore
          biased towards resolved or more corrected metaphases and
          it is likely that the induced ΔH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> frequency is
          actually higher than reported here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> assay was
          successful for all cell lines indicating that the
          doubling times are close to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. This indicates that
          the overall cell cycle timing is similar in all of the
          cell lines but does not rule out variations in
          stage-specific progression.
        
        
          The expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations is
          deleterious relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal mutations
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal deletion containing cell lines have a
          higher mean chromosome number than the control and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion cell lines, except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ΔN1</TIMEX> cell
          line which is somewhat elevated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This increase
          in chromosome number suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
          mutations lead to an increase in the aneuploidy of these
          SV40-transformed cells by inhibiting proper chromosome
          separation. The increase in SCE frequency correlates with
          an overall lower level of fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the
          C-terminal mutation cell lines and higher levels of
          protein expression in the cell lines with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deletions</ENAMEX>. These data demonstrate that mutation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> have a greater
          effect on the SCE frequency than does mutation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet-</ENAMEX>on system has strengths and
          weaknesses
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX> inducible expression system has experimental
          weaknesses in that the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX>-responsive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activator</ENAMEX> is not tightly regulated and some cells do not
          produce inducible cell lines. All of the GFP-BLM fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were produced at a low level in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inducer</ENAMEX>. Cell lines with a favored reproductive potential
          grew well and multiple useful stable transfectants were
          obtained (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal BLM</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) as
          compared to those containing deleterious mutant alleles
          (helicase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal deletions). The BS cell line
          used here lacks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and all cell lines obtained
          from transfection of the normal GFP-BLM gene had a
          background level of constitutive expression leading to a
          partially corrected SCE frequency relative to the
          parental line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> itself is not an
          innocuous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The cell lines expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> alone
          grew the most slowly of all of the clones in the
          collection and had a slightly elevated SCE frequency
          relative to the parental cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65-70</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>
          exchanges) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. When co-transfections were performed
          with one plasmid containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX>-responsive GFP-BLM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and another containing the selection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, all of
          the cell lines tested had low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCEs</ENAMEX> without induction (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Only when both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> and
          hygromycin-resistance expression <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were combined on
          the same plasmid were useful inducible clones recovered.
          Despite the time and effort required to screen multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, some with constitutive levels of expression,
          experimentally useful cell lines were obtained that
          allowed investigation of the function of the N-terminus
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX>-inducible system shows better SCE
          correction than constitutive expression
          Our previous study used stable transfected cell lines
          derived from the same SV40-transformed BS cell line used
          here, except that the normal and missense alleles of BLM
          were expressed from a constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> cDNA reduced the SCE frequency from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 to 24</NUMEX>
          exchanges per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> chromosomes. This is partial correction
          as normal cell lines have from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4-10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          chromosomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In addition the cells expressing the
          helicase-defective <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">K695T</NUMEX> allele grew slowly and
          eventually died. These results led us to use an inducible
          expression system. In this study the SCE frequency of the
          induced normal GFP-BLM cell line is closer to correction
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">K695T protein localizes</ENAMEX> in a pattern
          similar to the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> yet increases the SCE
          frequency, suggesting that the dominant negative effect
          of this allele caused the cell lines made in the previous
          study to die. Despite the limitations discussed above,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet-</ENAMEX>on system allowed isolation of inducible cell
          lines which more accurately paralleled normal than did
          lines with a constitutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>, and allowed the
          isolation and evaluation of cell lines expressing
          deleterious alleles.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> appear to be regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depots</ENAMEX> for
          BLM
          All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are expressed
          at a stable level near normal, reduce the SCE frequency
          to near normal, and are not efficiently packed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX>. Cells which lack PML do not form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> and have
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold increase in SCE frequency
          relative to control cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. This is similar to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> data for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal BLM deletions and demonstrate
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NB</ENAMEX> localization is not a requirement for BLM
          function. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> are likely to be storage locations or
          depots that regulate the release or recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>. All
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ΔN4</TIMEX> show
          nucleolar morphologies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> frequencies close to
          normal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ΔN4 protein</ENAMEX> has a lower correction efficiency
          and a different localization pattern than the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletions. This deletion removes a cluster of
          acidic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, similar to acidic activation domains
          known to activate transcription in a variety of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eucaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Clusters of acidic amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that
          function as transcriptional activation domains can also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activate chromosomal DNA replication</ENAMEX> by interacting with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication protein</ENAMEX> A (RPA) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> interacts with
          RPA70 in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPA</ENAMEX> clusters in
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Other studies have demonstrated that acidic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activators</ENAMEX> can relieve nucleosomal repression and that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX> function may be mediated by chromatin
          remodeling systems [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. Deletion of this acidic cluster
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> has an effect on localization and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE</ENAMEX> frequency
          and may target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPA</ENAMEX> bound to single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
          or it may allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> to function with chromatin remodeling
          complexes at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of ectopic invasion events.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletions do not efficiently associate
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX> by immunofluorescent examination. This does
          not rule out binding with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX> in the more diffusely
          stained regions. Studies in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX> function together as an enzymatic complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>]. Alternatively TOPIIIα could regulate BLM activity by
          altering its ability to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substrates</ENAMEX>. In vitro
          binding studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions of BLM
          (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">143-213 &</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1266-1417</TIMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) that
          interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">143-213</ENAMEX>) is
          removed by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔN2</NUMEX> construction. The cells express
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX> in multiple sized spherical bodies but no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-localization with the GFP fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is evident
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4F</NUMEX>). It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX> binds BLM only
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal BLM binding
          domain is of low affinity.
        
        
          The nucleolus is likely to be an important site for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> function
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> do co-localize with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PML</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPIIIα</ENAMEX> in the NBs yet elevate the SCE frequency.
          The helicase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal mutations that fail to
          localize normally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nucleolus</ENAMEX> fail to reduce the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCEs</ENAMEX> and implicate the nucleolus as a functional location
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study on chromosome
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX> documented an
          elevated frequency of recombination events in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">satellite</ENAMEX> stalks of acrocentric chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. In
          this report lymphocyte chromosomes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX> were compared to those from unaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. The
          frequency of exchanges in the BS cells was estimated to
          be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6/1000</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.1/1000</NUMEX> in control cells. In
          addition the cells from one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BS</ENAMEX> had
          acrocentrics with Q-bright satellites. The lymphocytes
          from this individual varied greatly with regard to the
          number of Q-bright satellites and which acrocentric
          chromosomes contained them, documenting a high frequency
          of recombination in the rDNA loci of BS cells. These data
          are consistent with a model in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> functions to
          untangle invasive events in multiple rDNA loci and SCEs
          are used as a bypass mechanism when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is absent.
        
        
          The localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> in the nucleolus is not an
          artifact but rather a function specified by the
          C-terminal domain
          The precise function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> that directs
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> to the nucleolus is still unclear. An NMR structural
          analysis of the HRD domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sgs1p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> domains suggests that this region is a
          single-strand nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> binding domain that functions
          as an accessory DNA binding region with the helicase
          domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. Helicase motifs are conserved in many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The specific function of individual helicases
          may be controlled by a substrate selection mechanism in
          the accessory regions flanking the helicase domain. The
          C-terminus may confer on BLM the ability to recognize and
          bind abnormal DNA structures such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quadraplexes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
          Alternatively the flanking regions may bind to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombination proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPA</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RAD51</TIMEX> at these
          chromosomal sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. The dominant negative nature of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal deletions suggests that these mutant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can be incorporated into normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX> and inhibit function or regulation. The
          numerous BLM <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> formed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal deletion
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may sequester repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that BLM
          has been shown to associate with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
          Many of the cell lines showed modest levels of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of the fusion proteins relative to levels
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> found in a normal SV40-transformed cell line. The
          immunofluorescent images show an apparent greater
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the nucleolus than is
          found in normal cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The stronger signals are
          caused by the expression levels as well as the
          sensitivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene. When <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expressed they can localize non-specifically. The
          advantage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> here is that the parental cell
          line lacks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and therefore the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can
          occupy normal positions without competing with endogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>. The GFP-BLM fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein accumulates</ENAMEX> in the same
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> as determined previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and
          does not appear to cause aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at the
          levels expressed here.
        
        
          BLM most likely functions in recombinational repair
          during DNA replication
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> helicases of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RecQ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are not essential
          for cellular viability but are important to genomic
          stability. Studies in model organisms suggest a role for
          the human orthologs in recombinational repair during DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>. Experimental evidence shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RecQ</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclease RecJ</ENAMEX> act together to restart stalled forks in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. A recent study of
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> Sgs1p gene suggests
          that it removes or prevents ectopic recombination events
          between non-homologous chromosomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. Experiments
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X. laevis BLM</ENAMEX> demonstrates its
          requirement in a reconstituted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> replication system [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>]. The in vitro enzymatic activities documented for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unwinding G4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">quadraplexes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">holliday junctions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-loops
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>], as well as the phenotypes of BS cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]
          are consistent with both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> has been
          localized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> GC-rich repeated regions (nucleolus and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telomeres</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] where the replication machinery is
          likely to need assistance to back up in order to untangle
          stalled forks and resolve inappropriate invasive events
          between repeated sequence elements found on multiple
          chromosomes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> has been found in large protein complex
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BRCA1</ENAMEX> and multiple DNA repair and replication
          factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] that may recognize and repair abnormal DNA
          structures that occur during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>. As both the
          helicase activity and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> are required
          to maintain genomic stability it is likely that the
          C-terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> recognizes abnormal DNA structures and
          the helicase activity unwinds these multi-stranded
          structures to engender efficient repair.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The GFP-BLM fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has helicase activity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> and functions to reduce the SCE frequency in BS
        cells. Deletions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> expressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fusion proteins
        demonstrate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain directs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> into
        nuclear bodies and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain is necessary for
        efficient nucleolar localization. The stable nucleolar
        localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is not due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression but
        rather to a function encoded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>.
        Mutations in the helicase domain and deletions in the
        C-terminal domain have a dominant negative effect on the
        SCE frequency and cause an increase in chromosome
        abnormalities, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletions have relatively
        little effect. These data demonstrate that the helicase
        activity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain directed nucleolar
        localization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is essential to maintain genomic
        stability. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBs</ENAMEX> appear to be storage or regulatory sites
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and are not required for BLM activity.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Expression and purification of GFP-BLM
          The normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> cDNA (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B3</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] was fused to the C
          terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). An <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8x</ENAMEX> polyhistidine epitope
          tag was added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX> with an
          oligonucleotide adapter
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5'AAAACTGCAGCGGCCGCCACCATGCACCAC-CACCACACCACCACCACGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTCACCG3</ENAMEX>').
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing confirmed the construction. A recombinant
          baculovirus expressing the fusion gene behind the
          polyhedrin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> was made in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sf9</NUMEX> cells using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BlueBac</ENAMEX> kit according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>'s
          protocol. Sf9 cells were infected for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX> at a
          multiplicity of infection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOI</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and sorted for green
          cells by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MoFlo, Cytomation</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and ten</NUMEX>
          cells per well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well microtiter plates containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uninfected Sf9</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. These primary viral stocks
          were assayed and amplified by infecting Sf9 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          well plates. The secondary stocks were analyzed by PCR
          and screened for a nuclear-localized GFP signal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
          Viral stocks containing only the recombinant GFP-BLM
          construction were amplified to produce high titer stocks
          for expression. Maximal expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> was found
          to be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 hours</TIMEX> of infection by western analysis with
          α-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Sf9 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sf900-II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>)
          were infected at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MOI of 5-10</ENAMEX> and harvested after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Efficiency of infection was monitored by
          immunofluorescent microscopy (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). The cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pellets</ENAMEX> were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-70°C</TIMEX>.
          Cell lysis was monitored by fluorescent microscopy and
          aliquots of column fractions were assayed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of
          96 well microtiter plates for green fluorescence using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Dynamics Storm Phosphorlmager</ENAMEX>. The frozen cell
          pellets from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> ml spinner flask culture were lysed by

          Q fractions containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> were loaded onto a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ml

          transfected with a plasmid expressing the tetracycline or

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seventeen G418</NUMEX>-resistant clones were screened for
          transfection efficiency and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX>-responsiveness. The

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> (pBi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). One cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HG2551a</NUMEX>) had an

          GFP-BLM alleles.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> alleles used here were cloned as fusions with

          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔC2</NUMEX> construction restores the nuclear localization
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Oligonucleotides were made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>.
          The deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">junctions</ENAMEX> were confirmed by DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequencing</ENAMEX>.
          Cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HG2551a</NUMEX> was transfected [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] with normal
          and mutant GFP-BLM genes cloned behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tet</ENAMEX>-responsive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> in plasmid pTRE (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>). Stable transfected
          cell lines containing these constructions were selected
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methods: co-transfection of these plasmids with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> plasmid containing a hygromycin-resistance gene
          driven by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herpes</ENAMEX> simplex thymidine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> or
          transfection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP-BLM</ENAMEX> allele plasmids that had been
          modified to contain the hygromycin-resistance gene
          expression <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. Few useful cell lines were obtained from
          the first method. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transfected</ENAMEX> clones that were
          resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 μg/ml G418</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">200 μg/</ENAMEX>ml hygromycin did
          not produce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> upon induction. In contrast transfection
          with the modified vector where the two expression units
          are on the same plasmid produced many useful cell lines.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ΔC2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line was from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transfection method
          and all of the others were selected using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.
