        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fabry disease</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-linked</ENAMEX> disorder resulting in
        reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This results in the systemic accumulation of
        D-galatosyl conjugates, particularly globotriosylceramide
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Gb3</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . Although the disorder is heterogeneous,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suffer renal, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
        complications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Enzyme</ENAMEX> replacement therapy has
        recently shown to have an effect on resting cerebral blood
        flow abnormalities and on other organ systems functions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . In the cerebrovascular system there is an increased
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel ectasia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        This may be related to the progressive accumulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">storage</ENAMEX> material in the cerebral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> or possibly, may be
        due to an abnormality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . The
        cerebrovascular complications are distributed predominantly
        in the posterior circulation with a progressive increase
        over time in the posterior distribution of small vessel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> as found on T 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -weighted images or fluid attenuated
        inversion recovery (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FLAIR</ENAMEX>) MR [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 10 11</ENAMEX> ] . It likely that
        such high signal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> on MR images represent ischemic
        small vessel <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, however, there are no
        neuropathological-radiological correlative studies
        confirming this assumption. Since ischemic brain lesions
        are irreversible, and accumulate over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, demonstrating
        a reduction in incidence is likely to require prolonged
        therapy in a relatively large cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> following
        this disease end-point. Previously, in Fabry <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, we
        have reported resting cerebral hyper-perfusion in a
        predominantly vertebro-basilar distribution together with
        abnormalities of vascular nitrotyrosine staining. This was
        reversed by enzyme replacement therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 10</ENAMEX> ] . The
        current study examines the cerebrovascular system in Fabry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in response to functional and pharmacological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>.
        We hypothesized that the cerebral vasculopathy of Fabry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is associated with abnormal cerebrovascular
        responses, and furthermore, that these would normalize with
        repeated intra-vascular infusion of α-galactosidase A [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX>
        ] . We compared the functional cerebrovascular responses in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fabry disease</ENAMEX> to those in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> and sex matched controls
        using both visual stimulation and acetazolamide challenge
        by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15O</TIMEX>]H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and positron emission tomography
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX>) to measure rCBF. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were then re-examined
        following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 6-month</TIMEX> double-blind placebo-controlled trial
        of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Functional activation
        by visual stimulation was chosen to examine the
        vertebro-basilar diathesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fabry disease</ENAMEX>. Acetazolamide,
        on the other hand, was hypothesized to identify areas of
        decreased cerebral perfusion following maximal cerebral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasodilation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease compared to controls. Such an
        abnormality, if present, might then be used to assess the
        therapeutic efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy.
        We define our usage of the term cerebral 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasomotor</ENAMEX> reserve as (ΔCBF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">res</ENAMEX> ) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> response at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 or 30</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> post-acetazolamide challenge minus the resting CBF
        for each subject. We define cerebral 
        vascular reactivity as the functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> response to a stimulus minus the resting CBF (ΔCBF 
        react ) while the maximal response to
        acetazolamide challenge provides an index of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebrovascular</ENAMEX> capacity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> response curve to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetazolamide</ENAMEX> can be considered like a high pass filter
        with an onset time constant to a steady state τ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and an offset time constant of τ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alteration</ENAMEX> and prolongation of τ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> will correspond to 
        prolonged cerebral vascular response
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> . An important concept of a high pass filter is
        that the system response is dependent on both the resistive
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) and capacitative (C) elements. Hence, the steady state
        value as well as time constants τ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and τ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> depend on both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and C components.
        Therefore the value of ΔCBF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">res</ENAMEX> also depends on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC</ENAMEX> component of
        the cerebral vascular system so that if there is an
        increased <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> component then ΔCBF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">res</ENAMEX> will be reduced, a situation seen in
        cerebral vaso-occlusive disease. If on the other hand the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are approximately equal in the comparison
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, similar steady state values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> and ΔCBF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">res</ENAMEX> values will be seen. The magnitude
        of the steady state response by itself gives an index of
        the cerebrovascular capacitative component (C).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          The methodology for this work has been described in
          detail [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-six</NUMEX> male hemizygote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fabry disease</ENAMEX> (age range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19-48</NUMEX>, mean age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.7</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> control subjects (age range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-48 years</TIMEX>,
          mean age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33.4</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9.7 years</TIMEX>) were enrolled in the study.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board of the National Institute</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Neurological Disorders and Stroke</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiation Safety Committee</ENAMEX> approved the study and all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> gave their written and
          informed consent. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> recruited to this study
          had neuropathic pain (main inclusion criterion) no focal
          or global neurological deficits and normal clotting
          function. Radiological evidence consistent with small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vessel disease</ENAMEX> was noted primarily on the FLAIR MRI as
          hyper-intense signal areas in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lesion on FLAIR imaging, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>

          no significant progression of the lesion burden over the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-month</TIMEX> trial period. No significant radiological
          abnormality was found on magnetic resonance angiography
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with no report of dolichoectasia.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, randomized to the placebo study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>,
          withdrew from the study for personal reasons and three

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placebo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) declined the follow-up acetazolamide
          challenge arm of the study at completion of the trial. A
          further <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had suffered a lacunar infarct <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>
          prior to commencement of the present study. The
          double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of ERT
          consisted of intravenous infusions of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">α galactosidase A</ENAMEX> (
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Replagal ™</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERT</ENAMEX> and twelve placebo for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>.
        
        
          PET Procedure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX> was performed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scanditronix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PC2048-</ENAMEX>15B
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomograph</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">tranverse</ENAMEX> resolution of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~6.5 mm</NUMEX>). A radial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arterial</ENAMEX> line was placed in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> for
          measurement of the [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15O</TIMEX>]H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> input function and arterial blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were aligned in the scanner with slices
          parallel to the orbital-meatal line with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
          slice obtained within the posterior fossa. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> was
          restrained with a thermoplastic facemask. Transmission
          scans were obtained with a rotating <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">68Ge/ 68Ga pin</ENAMEX>
          source, and were used to correct emission scans for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attenuation</ENAMEX>.
          Emission scans (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four minutes</TIMEX> duration) were obtained
          after intravenous injection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 mCi</NUMEX> of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15O</TIMEX>]H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and were begun automatically
          following arrival of radioactivity in the brain. Each
          study commenced with a sham scan in order to acclimatize
          the subject to scanning procedure which was followed by
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> resting cerebral blood flow scans during which the
          subject maintained eye closure. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> scans during visual
          stimulation were also performed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> apart. During
          visual activation the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were asked to focus on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> and white pattern reversal screen. The reversal
          frequency was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>. This stimulus frequency is known to
          induce the maximal change in the striate cortex blood
          flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The visual stimulus was commenced ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> before radioactivity reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Following
          the visual activation scans, intravenous acetazolamide
          was injected at a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg body weight and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          further scans were obtained <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 and 30 minutes</TIMEX> later.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
          The time shift between arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and brain data
          was determined by aligning the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scanner</ENAMEX> count rate data
          (sampled at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1 Hz</NUMEX>) to the blood data with the slice count
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> fitted to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tissue compartment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-parameter
          model. The CBF images were constructed from a
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pixel-by-pixel least square</NUMEX> fit for blood flow and
          partition coefficient [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . The MRI T1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">template</ENAMEX> was
          downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal Neurological Institute</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bic</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mni</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mcgill</ENAMEX>.ca/ [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . This served as a
          template for spatially registering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX> data. Prior to
          spatial registration the MRI template and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX> rCBF images
          were resampled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256×256×90</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9375</NUMEX> mm isotropic voxels.
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Pixel-by-pixel</NUMEX> averaging of the replicated visual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation PET</ENAMEX> scans was performed. Spatial registration
          of the PET images and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1</ENAMEX> MRI template was performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SPM99 http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fil</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ion</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/spm/spm99.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ]
          .
          The analysis is divided into a comparison of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baseline Fabry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the
          comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. A
          straight comparison was made between the control group
          and the baseline (time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> visual and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetazolamide</ENAMEX> co-registered PET data using SPM99 allowing
          appropriate multiple comparisons analyses. In order to
          isolate a potential treatment effect following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX>, a
          mixed statistical model was used. This analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> model divides the total variance into fixed and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> effects with the treatment effect attributable to
          the fixed effect. A two-step approach was adopted. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> allowing isolation of the fixed effect by forming
          subtraction images for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> by subtracting the
          pre-trial response from the post-trial response forming a
          contrast image. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> consisted of direct comparison
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX> and non-ERT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> contrast images. In this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, the attributable treatment effects were compared for
          the analysis of the visual activation and acetazolamide
          responses on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-by-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> basis. This gave for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> a difference image representing an
          independent estimate of each subject's response to visual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and acetazolamide after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX> or placebo.
          Statistical parametric maps (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX>{t}) were then calculated
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">spatially</ENAMEX> registered PET images by obtaining a
          set-level statistic of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> after setting the
          voxel threshold at p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX> or less and the cluster
          extent at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1024</TIMEX> or greater. The cluster extent threshold
          represents ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 cm</NUMEX> 3of brain tissue. The set-level
          statistic represents the statistical significance of the
          compared data volumes. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values given in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Results</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> are the set-level statistic.
          In order to characterize the visual activation
          response further, a specific region of interest (ROI) was
          used that included <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brodmann</ENAMEX> areas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18 and 19</TIMEX> as
          determined from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Talairach-Tournoux</ENAMEX> electronic brain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">atlas</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The visual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROI</ENAMEX> was derived from T1 MRI
          template which was then used to mask the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPM</ENAMEX> registered
          CBF images prior to calculation of the visual CBF
          responses. The mean visual cortex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> and global CBF
          values were calculated on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a pixel-by-pixel</NUMEX> basis after
          setting a CBF threshold value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">min/100 g</NUMEX> of
          tissue below which the pixels were excluded from
          calculation. This CBF level represents the lower limit of
          CNS tissue viability. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROI</ENAMEX> consisted of both gray and
          white matter areas associated with the visual cortex and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> areas.

          Mean absolute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> in the visual cortex was
          significantly greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> during visual
          stimulation compared to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002</NUMEX>).
          The visual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> reactivity (ΔCBF 
          react ) following visual stimulation
          was calculated in each subject by subtracting the visual
          cortex resting cerebral blood flow from the mean visual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation CBF</ENAMEX>. No significant difference was found in
          the visual area ΔCBF

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minutes</TIMEX> post-acetazolamide in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acetazolamide Challenge Studies</ENAMEX>
          There was a significantly increased blood flow in the
          Fabry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> during visual stimulation compared to
          controls (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). The increased rCBF was
          found predominantly in the posterior circulation area and
          visual cortex but some voxels increases in rCBF were
          found in the anterior circulation. No rCBF voxels were
          found to be significantly greater in the control group
          compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (data not shown). Restriction
          of the rCBF analysis to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Talairach</ENAMEX>-defined visual cortex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROI</ENAMEX> showed no significant difference in visual reactivity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(Δ</ENAMEX>CBF

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          Following acetazolamide at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 20-minute</TIMEX> time point,
          the rCBF in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was significantly elevated
          in a more central and anterior distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.041</NUMEX>),
          while the distribution of the higher rCBF voxels in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was more posterior (data not shown, p =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.002</NUMEX>). At the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> time point the significantly
          elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rCBF</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had disappeared while
          the significantly elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rCBF</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persisted</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>) indicating a prolonged
          cerebral vascular response time. No difference in
          regional ΔCBF 
          res between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> and control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> was found indicating normal regional cerebral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> reserve in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX> resulted in a significantly lower absolute rCBF
          during visual stimulation in the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compared
          to the placebo (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) while no
          significantly decreased areas of rCBF were found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placebo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. A reduction in rCBF was also found when
          the analysis was restricted to the visual cortex (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>) with no areas of significantly decreased rCBF in
          the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX> led to decreased rCBF after
          acetazolamide infusion at both time points (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time</TIMEX> = <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>,
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). No significant decrease in rCBF was found at a
          comparable cluster extent and voxel threshold in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placebo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our data indicate the presence of an abnormal functional
        response to visual stimulation both in global and regional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease. This however was not due to
        an alteration in vascular reactivity. Previously, we
        demonstrated that the resting rCBF in Fabry <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is
        elevated compared to controls particularly in the posterior
        circulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In view of the normal visual area
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivity</ENAMEX> in Fabry <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, these findings indicate that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> response to visual activation is largely
        explained by the elevated resting rCBF. However, the more
        generalized cerebrovascular response noted in both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carotid</ENAMEX> and vertebro-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">basilar</NUMEX> circulation suggests stimulus
        spread in Fabry <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, possibly due to a decreased
        response threshold in non-visual cortex vasculature.
        Following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX>, this resting rCBF abnormality was reversed [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] .
        The cerebral visual stimulation paradigm used in the
        current study is known to induce maximal cerebral blood
        flow [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] and is therefore a useful stimulus for the
        study of neuro-vascular coupling. Visual stimulation was
        chosen in particular because of the known predilection of
        the cerebrovascular abnormalities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease for the
        posterior circulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 10</ENAMEX> ] . The lack of an increase or
        decrease in visual rCBF reactivity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease
        suggests normal neuro-vascular coupling mechanism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ]
        .
        Acetazolamide-induced maximal cerebral vasodilatory
        response is often used to assess cerebrovascular reserve [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . The greatest difference between our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
        controls occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 30-minute</TIMEX> time point rather than
        at the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> time point of the acetazolamide challenge.
        This finding is consistent with a prolongation of the
        cerebral vascular response time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fabry disease</ENAMEX>. ERT
        significantly decreased the prolonged cerebral vascular
        response time. The vasodilator effect of acetazolamide on
        the cerebral vasculature has been characterized by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcranial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doppler</ENAMEX> (TCD) studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . At a
        dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg the effect of acetazolamide is thought to
        be supramaximal with maximal cerebral vasodilation induced
        within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 20 minutes</TIMEX>. By <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCD</ENAMEX> a maximal dose-response was
        found to occur with an acetazolamide infusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 15</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> with maximal vasoreactivity occurring between
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 and 30 minutes</TIMEX> post acetazolamide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Using [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15O</TIMEX>]H
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX>, a further study of rCBF
        following <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 g</NUMEX> of acetazolamide demonstrated the peak
        response to occur at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> while the plateau phase
        occurred during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the twenty to thirty minute</TIMEX> time period
        post acetazolamide [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The measurements in the current
        study obtained at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty and thirty minutes</TIMEX> post
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetazolamide</ENAMEX> injection therefore, probably corresponds to
        the plateau phase of reported acetazolamide responses.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBF</ENAMEX> response to supra-maximal acetazolamide
        challenge consists of a phase of increasing CBF followed by
        a plateau phase with a terminal recovery phase. This can be
        considered in terms of cerebrovascular resistance and
        capacity, analogous to a high pass filter where high
        frequency components of the system response are removed.
        The importance of this analogy is that the plateau response
        is dependent on both the system's resistive and
        capacitative components. In the present study it was seen
        that the vasomotor reserve in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease was within
        normal limits despite the elevated resting rCBF. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerebrovascular</ENAMEX> capacity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease was also within
        normal limits, suggesting absence of clinically significant
        vaso-occlusive disease in the cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabry</ENAMEX> patients
        examined. This finding is supported by the absence of
        abnormalities on magnetic resonance angiography in the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Reduced ΔCBF 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">res</ENAMEX> would be expected when the resistive
        component is increased reducing the amplitude of the
        acetazolamide induced plateau response.
        The hyperemic cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetazolamide</ENAMEX> is not inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide</ENAMEX> synthase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N G-monomethyl-L</ENAMEX>-arginine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-NMMA)
        suggesting that NO does not mediate vasoreactivity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX>
        ] . The mechanism of acetazolamide vasodilation, beyond
        smooth muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">intracellular</ENAMEX> and extracellular acidosis due
        carbonic anhydrase inhibition, is unclear. Abnormalities of
        the peripheral vasculature responses to acetylcholine have
        been previously described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease together with
        nitric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxide pathway dysregulation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 9</NUMEX> ] suggesting
        participation of non-NO regulation of vascular tone. A
        similar vascular hyper-responsiveness has been noted in
        caveolin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knock-out mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] raising the possibility
        that the accumulation of Gb 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> results in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-activity of uncoupled
        endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide synthase</ENAMEX> within endothelial cell
        caveolae generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">superoxide</ENAMEX> and other reactive oxygen
        species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The latter may have a vasodilatatory
        effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Predominance of vascular abnormalities in
        the vertebro-basilar system in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease suggests
        fundamental biologic differences between the anterior and
        the posterior circulation. Such difference might, for
        example, result from the neural crest origin of pericytes
        and vascular smooth muscle in the anterior circulation as
        opposed to paraxial mesoderm in the vertebro-basilar or
        posterior circulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusion
        The current study indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX> normalized
        acetazolamide-induced prolonged cerebral vascular response
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fabry</ENAMEX> disease. This finding suggests that the
        underlying abnormality is present at the luminal side of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBB</ENAMEX>) complex and is due to an
        abnormality of the cerebral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> since it is unlikely
        that α-galactosidase A crosses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBB</ENAMEX> to any appreciable
        extent. Further, the treatment effect appeared to be
        uniform across all cerebral vascular distributions.
