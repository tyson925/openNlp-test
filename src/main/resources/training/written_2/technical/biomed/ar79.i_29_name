          Introduction
          In cancer the gelatinases [matrix metalloproteinase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX>)-2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>] have been shown to be associated with
          tissue invasion and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastatic disease</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory arthritis</ENAMEX> the gelatinases are expressed in
          the synovial membrane, and have been implicated in
          synovial tissue invasion into adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and
          bone. It is hypothesized that an imbalance between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of the gelatinases results in
          higher levels of activity, enhanced local proteolysis,
          and bone erosion.
        
        
          Objectives
          To determine whether the expression and activity
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with early erosion formation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          synovitis of recent onset.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and method
          A subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was selected from a larger
          early synovitis cohort on the basis of tissue
          availability for the study of synovial tissue and serum
          gelatinase expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with peripheral joint
          synovitis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 1 years</TIMEX>' duration were evaluated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clinically</ENAMEX> and serologically on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> visits over a period
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. At the initial visit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> underwent a
          synovial tissue biopsy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> swollen joint, and patients
          had radiographic evaluation of hands and feet initially
          and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> levels were determined, and synovial
          tissue was examined by immunohistology for the expression
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, and their molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>.
          Gelatinolytic activity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> was quantified
          using a sensitive, tissue-based gel zymography technique.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> underwent closed synovial biopsy
          and their synovial tissues were similarly analyzed.
        
        
          Results
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> fulfilled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
          College of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rheumatology</ENAMEX> criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>) being rheumatoid factor positive. Of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> had a spondylarthropathy
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> had undifferentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>. Radiographically,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had erosions at multiple sites by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, whereas none of the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had developed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">erosive disease</ENAMEX> of this extent. In the tissue, latent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> was widely expressed in the synovial lining layer
          and in areas of stromal proliferation in the sublining
          layer and stroma, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> was expressed more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sparsely</ENAMEX> and focally. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> were all
          detected in similar areas of the lining layer on
          consecutive histologic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. Tissue expression of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, the activator for pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, was significantly
          higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> than in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.4 Â± 5</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>
          Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cells/high-power field; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>). In contrast, the
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX>, an inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, was lower in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> than in the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 Â± 12</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 Â± 9</NUMEX>
          cells/high-power field; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). Synovial tissue
          expressions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> were virtually
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> in normal synovial tissue samples. The
          synovial tissue samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with erosive disease
          had significantly higher levels of active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> than did
          those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without erosions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Tissue
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, however, did not correlate
          with the serum levels of these enzymes.
          With the exception of serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, which was not
          elevated over normal, serum levels of all of the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIMPs</ENAMEX> were elevated to varying degrees, and were
          not predictive of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">erosive disease</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, MMP-1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>, both of which were associated
          with the presence of erosions, were positively correlated
          with each other ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.42</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Discussion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> are thought to play an important role
          in the evolution of joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">erosions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammatory arthritis</ENAMEX>. Most studies have concentrated on
          the contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> to the synovitis, because
          synovial fluid and serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> levels are markedly
          increased in inflammatory arthropathies. Previously
          reported serum levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> have varied widely. In the
          present sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with synovitis of recent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">onset</ENAMEX>, serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> levels were elevated in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 21%</NUMEX>.
          Moreover, these elevations were not specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, the
          tissue expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> was focal, and the levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> activity were not well correlated with early
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erosions</ENAMEX>. Although serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> levels were not of
          prognostic value, high synovial tissue levels of MMP-2
          activity were significantly correlated with the presence
          of early erosions. This may reflect augmented activation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> by the relatively high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX> and low
          levels of TIMP-2 seen in these tissues. We were able to
          localize the components of this trimolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> to
          the synovial lining layer in consecutive tissue sections,
          a finding that is consistent with their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colocalization</ENAMEX>.
          In conclusion, we have provided evidence that active
          MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are detectable in the inflamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synovium</ENAMEX> and may be involved in the development of early
          bony erosions. These results suggest that strategies to
          inhibit the activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> may have the potential
          for retarding or preventing early erosions in patients
          with inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Introduction
        Radiographic erosions are characteristic of a number of
        chronic inflammatory arthropathies, and are associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">articular</ENAMEX> destruction leading to functional loss and
        disability [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. The prevention or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erosions</ENAMEX> is a major objective for early therapeutic
        interventions in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with new onset <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathologic</ENAMEX> processes that underlie the
        development of erosions are incompletely understood, a
        considerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence has suggested that a pannus
        of cells that originate in chronically inflamed,
        proliferative synovial tissue becomes locally invasive, and
        enzymatically degrades the matrix of the articular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and periarticular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Although a number of enzymes have been shown to be
        involved in erosion formation, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> metalloproteinase (MMP) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are thought to play a
        central role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">articular bone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagenases</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>] and stromelysins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] have been the
        best studied, and marked elevations in serum and synovial
        levels have been found in rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. A
        number of studies have shown that the serum and synovial
        levels of both gelatinases <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-9</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13</TIMEX>] are similarly elevated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>. Although both of
        these MMPs are expressed at the junction between synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pannus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], further evidence of
        their direct role in erosion formation is lacking. In
        addition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this subfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> are involved in
        the invasiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>], and thus may also
        play a similar role in the invasion of synovial pannus.
        The regulation of MMP activity is complex, and occurs at
        multiple levels [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>]. In most cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secreted</ENAMEX> as proenzymes and then undergo extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Few studies have evaluated the levels of active
        MMPs 
        in situ . Gel zymography has proved
        to be a sensitive and effective method of detecting the
        activity of gelatinases in small tissue samples [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. In
        the present study we evaluated the levels of active MMP-2
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> in small synovial biopsy samples obtained from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with synovitis of recent onset. We also examined
        the synovial expression of the gelatinases by
        immunohistology, as well as their serum levels in order to
        determine whether these indices may predict erosions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and method
        
          Patient population
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that formed a subset of a
          larger early synovitis cohort, recruited into an ongoing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> protocol (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX>-AR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0194</NUMEX>),
          were selected for analysis on the basis of having stored
          optimum cooling temperature (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCT</ENAMEX>) compound samples
          available for analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had peripheral joint
          synovitis with duration longer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> but less than
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. After the initial evaluation they were
          followed prospectively for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. Of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> fulfilled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of Rheumatology</ENAMEX>
          criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> fulfilled the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Spondylarthropathy Study Group</ENAMEX> criteria for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spondylarthropathies</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> could not be
          classified and were diagnosed with undifferentiated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>.
          Serum aliquots obtained at the initial visit were used
          for the analysis of serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> and tissue inhibitor of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloproteinase</ENAMEX> (TIMP) levels. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> underwent a
          closed needle biopsy of synovial tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] from an
          inflamed joint, typically a knee. Tender and swollen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">joint</ENAMEX> counts were obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> joint areas; hips were
          excluded. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterioposterior</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral radiographs</ENAMEX> of the
          hands and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> were obtained at the initial visit and at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-year</TIMEX> follow-up visit. Radiographs were read by
          experienced radiologists, who were unaware of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s diagnosis or test results, and were scored for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erosions</ENAMEX>. Erosions were defined as unequivocal loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortical</ENAMEX> and subcortical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> different
          joints of either the hands or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          who underwent a clinical evaluation and analysis of serum
          MMP levels, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> had synovial tissue biopsies with
          detectable lining layer and large enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to
          determine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIMP</ENAMEX> expression by gel zymography and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX>.
          Healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) were recruited under the
          same protocol and a synovial knee biopsy was performed
          once signed informed consent was obtained. These tissues
          were also assayed by gel zymography and stained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemically</ENAMEX>.

          Gel zymography
          Gel zymography on synovial tissue samples was
          performed according to a protocol developed by Kleiner 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Unfixed cryosections
          of synovial tissue, obtained from closed needle biopsies
          as described above, were scraped off the slide with a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>-gauge needle, transferred into a microfuge tube, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vortexed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HT-1080</ENAMEX> fibrosarcoma cell line was
          used as a positive control for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-9</ENAMEX> activity.
          Of each sample suspension, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 Î</NUMEX>¼l were loaded onto a

          anhydrous CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.02%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brijdetergent</ENAMEX>. The gels
          were subsequently stained with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> Comassie blue
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-250</ENAMEX>), destained with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> acetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>,
          and incubated in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> glycerol. They were
          dried between cellophane sheets. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Areas</ENAMEX> of gelatinase
          activity appeared as nonstaining bands on the gels.
          The zymography gels were scanned and analyzed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health Image</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> software.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> pixel density for each gelatinolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was
          recorded and reported in volume units of pixel intensity

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, determined by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> quantitation kit
          according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions, and
          reported as gelatinase activity in nanograms per
          milligrams of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Gelatinolytic bands at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92, 72</TIMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> kDA represent latent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, latent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, and active

          Immunohistochemistry
          Immunohistochemistry was performed according to
          standard techniques [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCT</ENAMEX>-embedded synovial tissue
          was cryosectioned into <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8-Î¼m</NUMEX> thick sections and acetone
          fixed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> slides. After hydration and blocking of
          endogenous peroxidase activity, tissues were blocked with
          a dilution of human and goat serum. Sections were
          incubated with primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at the following
          concentrations: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 : 75</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 : 75</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          : <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 : 30</TIMEX>). Negative controls using
          either mouse immunoglobulin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> or no primary antibody
          were performed with each experiment. Slides were washed
          and incubated with goat antimouse biotinylated antibody
          at a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 : 750</ENAMEX> dilution followed by incubation with
          streptavidine horseradish peroxidase. Slides were
          developed with a substrate chromogen solution until a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brown</ENAMEX> reaction product was observed, then counterstained
          with hematoxylin and coverslipped.
        
        
          Histologic evaluation of the synovial tissue
          Synovial tissues suitable for analysis were
          histologically evaluated for the presence and degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX>. All tissues were analyzed in a blinded
          manner by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>. Proliferation of the
          lining layer, inflammatory cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">infiltration</ENAMEX> of the
          sublining layer, lymphocytic aggregates, and stromal
          proliferation were scored semiquantitatively from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 to 3</NUMEX>
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> high-power fields (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPFs</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 Ã—</ENAMEX>) for each
          category. Scores were added and divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to derive
          a tissue composite index. Tissue scores for MMP
          expression were obtained by counting the number of
          positive cells in the lining layer and sublining layer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> HPF underneath the lining layer) in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">representative HPFs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400Ã—</ENAMEX>) and expressed as positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cells/HPF</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Statistical methods
          Differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient groups</ENAMEX> were analyzed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ï‡ 2</ENAMEX>, analysis of variance, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> tests.

          Patient clinical features
          The clinical features of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied are
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> were older, had more

          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> had erosions at multiple sites
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>, whereas none of the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
          developed definite erosions. Patient characteristics in

          expression in synovial tissue
          Expressions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> in
          representative locations in the synovial tissue specimens
          are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Of note, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">detect MMP-2</ENAMEX> recognized only the latent zymogen form.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> was widely expressed in the synovial lining layer
          and in areas of stromal proliferation in the sublining
          and stromal layer. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> expression was more focal and
          was observed sparsely in the lining layer and in the
          endothelium of single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> were detected primarily in the
          lining layer on consecutive tissue sections.
        
        
          Comparisons of tissue levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, and TIMP-2
          MMP expression was assayed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> tissues and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>

          evidence of an arthropathy or traumatic injury (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          Tissue composite indices of inflammation were similar in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> tissues. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
          erosions at multiple sites, as compared with none of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Synovial tissue expressions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> were virtually undetectable in all
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-9</ENAMEX> expression was observed in an
          isolated area of one normal synovial tissue sample.
          Tissue expression for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, the activator for
          pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, was significantly higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> than in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.4 Â± 5</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cells/HPF; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.009</NUMEX>). In contrast, the
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX>, an inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, was lower in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> than in the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 Â± 12</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 Â± 9</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Activated</ENAMEX> and latent
          MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> activities, as measured by gel zymography, tended
          to be higher overall in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> than in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but results were not statistically
          different.
        
        
          Radiographic erosions are associated with higher
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> activity in the synovial tissue
          The results of synovial tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and MMP-9
          expressions were compared among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with erosive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without erosions, and normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">erosive disease</ENAMEX> had significantly
          higher synovial levels of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.9 Â± 8.1</NUMEX> versus
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18.9 Â± 9.4 ng</NUMEX>/mg; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>) and active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.5</NUMEX> Â±

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>) than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erosions</ENAMEX>. Similarly, mean MMP-9 activity was higher in
          tissue samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">erosive disease</ENAMEX>, but
          wide variations in tissue expression resulted in poor
          discrimination between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. As expected, synovium of

        Discussion
        Joint destruction is one of the hallmarks of erosive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthropathies</ENAMEX> and leads to significant morbidity and
        disability. Newer imaging studies have concluded that
        erosion formation can occur very early in the disease [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>]. Detailed pathologic studies, although generally
        performed on destroyed joints obtained at the time of
        arthroplasty, have suggested that these erosions result
        from direct invasion of synovial tissue into the adjacent
        articular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>. It has been postulated that
        the locally invasive cells that form the aggressive pannus
        have acquired a transformed phenotype, and analogies to
        invasive cancer cells have been made [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Several
        metalloproteinases that are capable of the proteolytic
        degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> are thought to play a
        major role in the dissolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and cartilage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>, allowing the invasive cells to migrate into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stroma</ENAMEX> across cell boundaries. Although the relative
        contribution of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> to this process remains unclear,
        the gelatinases, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, appear to play a
        prominent role in tissue invasion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, most studies have concentrated on the
        contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> to the underlying mechanism of joint
        destruction. In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> levels tend to be
        higher in inflammatory arthropathies than in traumatic,
        osteoarthritic, and tissue repair processes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 27</TIMEX>].
        Furthermore, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> differ in tissue distribution
        and transcriptional regulation. These observations suggest
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> may contribute differentially to the
        pathophysiologic processes that lead to joint
        destruction.
        In the joint, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> is expressed in macrophages in the
        synovial lining layer, in vascular endothelial cells,
        leukocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoclasts. It is also
        expressed on cultured fibroblasts and on activated
        fibroblasts 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 28</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> is inducible
        by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-Î±
        and interleukin-1 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 29</TIMEX>], and the post-transcriptional
        regulation 
        in vivo remains incompletely
        understood. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> is secreted in an inactive zymogen form
        and can be activated 
        in vitro by the plasmin cascade and
        through other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31, 32, 33</TIMEX>]. In its inactive form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> is complexed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. The regulation of MMPs
        by inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> and vascular structures have previously
        suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> may be associated with the synovial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> and neovascularization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>].
        In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, in the inactive zymogen
        form, is constitutively expressed by many cell types,
        including fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and is
        involved in many aspects of normal tissue remodeling and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>]. Its unique regulatory requirements
        at the cell surface have suggested a special role for MMP-2
        in tissue invasion. The transcriptional and
        post-translational activation of this enzyme is tightly
        regulated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-2</ENAMEX> differs from several other members
        of the metalloproteinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in that its transcription
        is not induced in response to the proinflammatory cytokines
        tumor necrosis factor-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interleukin-1</ENAMEX>, and seems
        primarily regulated post-translationally. As is
        characteristic of most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> is produced as a
        proenzyme, and requires activation by enzymatic cleavage.
        Evidence from several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> has suggested that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> in its active form is bound in a trimolecular complex
        at the cell surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40, 41, 42</TIMEX>]. Pro-MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> complexed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">binds</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> binding site on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane-bound</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX> receptor, and through a
        conformational change the catalytic domain becomes exposed
        forming the active enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Upon dissociation from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX> receptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> binds the catalytic site and
        suppresses the activity. Thus, the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> is
        regulated locally by a delicate balance between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX>. Studies have localized
        this trimolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> to the invadopodia of malignant
        cells at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of tissue invasion into stroma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43, 44</TIMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> levels and high tissue expression levels of active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> are predictors of disease severity and shortened
        survival in several malignancies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>].
        In view of the analogies between erosion formation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX> and tumor invasion in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, we hypothesized
        that activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> might play an
        important role in the early stages of invasion of synovial
        pannus into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>. Synovial tissue specimens
        obtained from a cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with early synovitis
        were examined for the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> and components of
        the MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-associated trimolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. A highly
        sensitive zymographic technique was used to evaluate tissue
        levels of active and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">latent MMP-2</ENAMEX>. Our immunohistologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX> are all
        localized to the synovial lining layer. Previous reports
        have found colocalization of these molecules in areas of
        tissue remodeling, loosening of prosthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45, 46</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>], and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage-pannus</ENAMEX> junction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Although
        the results of these experiments do not prove that the
        expression of these molecules occurs on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, they
        are consistent with the view that the synovial lining layer
        is a site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">activation</ENAMEX>.
        Because of the blind nature of the biopsy technique used
        in the present study, we did not specifically sample areas
        of synovium directly adjacent to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. We
        did, however, ensure that all of the needle biopsy samples
        examined immunohistologically and zymographically had clear
        evidence of a well-defined synovial lining layer, were of
        adequate size, and were thus appropriate for comparative
        evaluation. The selection of biopsy material with
        detectable lining layer and sufficiently large size for
        analysis may have biased our results toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        more proliferative synovial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, and possibly more
        severe disease. This selection bias would have occurred in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, however, and is therefore
        unlikely to account for the differences seen in MMP-2
        activity between the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We compared the
        synovium of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> with that of patients
        with other forms of early synovitis, and with that of
        normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> samples tended to have the
        highest expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP-14</ENAMEX>, but they
        exhibited low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TIMP-2</ENAMEX> expression. More
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, we showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with radiographic
        erosions, all of whom had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, had the highest levels of
        active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> by gel zymography. We therefore propose that
        the augmented levels of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> detected in the
        synovia of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with early erosive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> may relate, at
        least in part, to an imbalance between activation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        and inhibition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIMP</ENAMEX>-2.
        Immunohistologically, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> expression was clearly
        higher in inflamed synovium than in normal synovium, where
        it was virtually undetectable. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> activity
        levels tended to be higher in the synovial samples of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with radiographic erosions than those of patients
        without erosions, but the measured values varied widely in
        the specimens examined. The focal expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX> in
        these synovial tissues, combined with the small number of
        samples examined, might have contributed to the wide tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variations</ENAMEX> observed.
        Overall, the present observations suggest an association
        between the presence of active synovial gelatinases and the
        early development of erosive articular damage. Although the
        evidence is indirect, these data are consistent with the
        hypothesis that high levels of activated synovial
        gelatinases reflect augmented synovial invasiveness; these
        observations are similar to those made in the context of
        invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Although there continues to be
        controversy regarding the origins of the invasive cells at
        the junction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage/bone</ENAMEX> and pannus, considerable
        evidence has accumulated that the lining cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        synovium exhibit a 'transformed' phenotype that is typical
        of invasive cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 48</TIMEX>].
        We attempted to evaluate the more readily available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> levels of active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> as predictors of joint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erosions</ENAMEX>. Overall, only the serum levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> were
        significantly associated with erosions and with CRP levels.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persistent CRP</ENAMEX> elevation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> has been shown to
        be associated with the progression of radiographic erosions
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>], but a previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> study failed to associate MMP-1
        levels with erosions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. In general, serum levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> have tended to vary widely in the reported studies [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 11, 12, 51</TIMEX>], and appear not to be of prognostic value.
        Furthermore, degranulation of platelets and neutrophils may
        contribute to the elevation of serum levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and
        MMP-9 seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and may be an explanation for
        the high baseline level in the serum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52, 53</TIMEX>]. In
        contrast, this is not the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX>, because no blood
        cell carries a preformed secretory granule of this enzyme
        and this may explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-1</ENAMEX> levels relate more closely
        to radiographic erosions. The measurement of serum MMP
        levels in the context of controlled therapy trials has not
        been well explored.
        In the present study we provided evidence that active
        MMP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are expressed in the synovium and may be
        involved in the development of bony erosions. Therapeutic
        strategies to inhibit a broad spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-2</ENAMEX> and possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP-9</ENAMEX>, may therefore present a more
        powerful approach to retard or prevent early erosions in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an inflammatory arthropathy.
