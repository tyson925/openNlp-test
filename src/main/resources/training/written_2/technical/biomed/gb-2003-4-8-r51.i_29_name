        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX>-sequence-based comparative analysis to infer
        biological function is important and familiar to most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>. Sequence-profile methods such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>-BLAST [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        ] or HMMER [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] are often used to detect distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX>,
        and resources such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prosite</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , BLOCKS [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and PFAM
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] are representative resources resulting from protein
        classification based on sequence patterns. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protein</ENAMEX>
        structure also plays a crucial role in a full understanding
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> function as it is more conserved than sequence
        and hence exposes relationships not possible from sequence
        alone. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> sequence
        identity, and yet possess a similar fold and possibly
        related function.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the early insights gained from comparative
        genomics was domain accretion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . From prokaryotes to
        eukaryotes, the number of domains increases. But in higher
        eukaryotes, different combinations of domains are often
        observed in the same and different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. From a
        structural point of view domains are discreet compact
        folding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] classifies <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> into either a
        homeomorphic superfamily (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> in the same order) or a homology domain superfamily
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from different homeomorphic superfamilies sharing
        a common ancestral domain). This modular nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        necessitates a new approach to proteome annotation - a
        structural-domain-based approach.
        There already exist a number of automated or
        semi-automated complete genome annotation systems. For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GeneQuiz</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDANT</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pipelines
        that are comprehensive and highly automated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Similarly, there are several sites that provide protein
        structure annotations for various genomes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superfamily</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        ] uses a set of hidden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (HHM) profiles based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. MatDB, based on PEDANT analysis
        of 
        Arabidopsis thaliana , provides
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annotations</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> domain position specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">scoring matrix</ENAMEX> (PSSM) profiles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for</ENAMEX>
        Biotechnology Information (NCBI) maintains a Conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domain Database</ENAMEX> (CDD) that uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFAM</ENAMEX> and SMART [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domain PSSMs</ENAMEX> to detect possible structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX>. The
        3D-Genomics database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> from
        3D-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Gene3D uses the CATH domain classification
        to annotate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and genomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        We have developed an automated integrative genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> (iGAP) initially to annotate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins of</ENAMEX> 
        A. thaliana and later all proteomes
        based on a comprehensive fold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In
        addition to the domains from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX>, we have included domains
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parsed</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domain parser</ENAMEX> (PDP) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">full-length Protein Data Bank</ENAMEX> (PDB) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> not
        classified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX>, but associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> using
        combinatorial extension (CE), a structural-similarity
        search <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . The result is a comprehensive
        fold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (FOLDLIB) from which comparative and fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> models of three-dimensional structure are
        derived. As a step beyond PSI-BLAST or PFAM profiles, we
        have used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123D</NUMEX>+ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , which not only performs
        target-template profile-profile alignment, but also uses
        secondary structure and contact capacity potential
        information for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fold recognition. Further, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> provides a graded reliability index of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">functional prediction reliability</ENAMEX> ranging from A to E based
        on extensive benchmarking of selectivity versus sensitivity
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.N</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.N.S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.E.B.</ENAMEX>, unpublished work). Here we
        describe iGAP and the initial results on the analysis of 
        A. thaliana , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> proteome
        processed, using a combination of web interface and SQL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">queries</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Comparisons are made to other
        annotation schemes used to process 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and to other proteomes
        processed with iGAP. The iGAP is systematically being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> proteomes, completely or
        partially sequenced and publicly available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ,
        to develop a comparative proteomic resource.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        Automated annotation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pipelines</ENAMEX> are crucial to organize
        the deluge of genomic information. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1compares</ENAMEX> features
        of iGAP with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneQuiz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDANT</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> established
        genome annotation methodologies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">GeneQuiz</ENAMEX> focuses on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> and function assignment through sequence similarity
        search; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEDANT</ENAMEX> is a comprehensive analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> with
        emphasis on gene prediction, secondary and tertiary
        structure assignment; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iGAP</ENAMEX> puts much more emphasis on fold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>, threading and, to be released in the near
        future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX> modeling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2compares</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of 
        A. thaliana (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAT</ENAMEX>) database to
        established databases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein annotations</ENAMEX>. They differ
        in both coverage and focus. Again, each of the resources
        has clear strengths in a number of areas, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAT</ENAMEX> stands
        out in terms of the amount of structural information it
        provides. Whereas other resources are limited to what is
        present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> or SCOP, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAT</ENAMEX> provides additional domains
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDP</ENAMEX>, and genetic domains from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Astral</ENAMEX>. Moreover, an
        important feature of iGAP is the benchmarking used to
        establish the reliability measures. Such quality assurance
        is critical to the future development of these resources if
        they are to be used in a meaningful way by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">experimentalists</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3aindicates</ENAMEX> the coverage of the 
        Arabidopsis proteome provided by each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX> and associated resource. It is clear that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro</ENAMEX> and iGAP represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches that provide
        very high coverage of the 
        Arabidopsis proteome, based on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structural information respectively. A
        combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterProScan</ENAMEX> and iGAP is under active
        development to integrate sequence- and structure-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotation</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 14%</NUMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis Information Resource</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX>) GO annotation is based on nonelectronic annotation.
        This makes an even stronger argument for the integration of
        sequence- and structure-based annotation, to reduce the
        possibility of error propagation in electronic annotation.
        Table 3bhighlights some specific examples of results
        achieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAT</ENAMEX> over other means. Whether these results are
        meaningful depends on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s perspective. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>,
        a few additional predictions with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> certainty could be a
        distraction. To another, they might, in connection with
        additional experimental evidence, prove valuable. A future
        challenge to those of us providing such resources is to
        minimize the pain and maximize the gain for the different
        types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. Again quality assurance and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> interface
        design will prove important. While we have made efforts to
        classify the reliability of our predictions, they are still
        predictions and should be used, where possible, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> experimental proof.
        With regard to iGAP specifically, we first looked at the
        overall coverage of the 
        Arabidopsis proteome using iGAP
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). We were able to assign <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 70%</NUMEX> of the 
        Arabidopsis proteome to folds which
        had a reliability index C (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> confidence) or better. This
        compares to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX> of 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the NCBI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonredundant</ENAMEX> (NR) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> database having an assigned
        function. While fold assignment does not necessarily
        translate into functional assignment, it provides a useful
        indicator.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAT</ENAMEX> provides annotations not reported by other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX>. Some examples are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. For
        example, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">AP2</NUMEX>-domain is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding transcription
        factor that controls flower and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> . The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the
        AP2 domain is found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1gcc</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Standard
        BLAST using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1gcc</NUMEX> sequence provides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> hits at 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.1</NUMEX> (a very weak threshold).
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PAT</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</NUMEX> hits of A or B reliability (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>
        confidence) plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of reliability <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90% < 99%</NUMEX>
        confidence). Another putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GI</ENAMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15228210</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">locus id At3g47660</ENAMEX>) has a previously undetected domain at
        the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> which resembles the structure of the
        pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from phospholipase C delta
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1mai</ENAMEX>) (C prediction). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PH</ENAMEX> domains are commonly found in
        signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domains</ENAMEX> found in
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (also documented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro</ENAMEX> domains)
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FYVE/PHD</ENAMEX> zinc finger and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an RCC1</TIMEX> like domain (a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of chromosome condensation), with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> and B
        reliabilities respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> also reported a sugar
        transporter signature for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prosite</ENAMEX>. While
        the exact function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> remains to be determined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX>, the new finding of a putative PH domain
        could offer clues to its potential mechanism for signaling
        and intracellular targeting.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we surveyed a set of 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have known
        protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (confidence level A, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4a</ENAMEX>). For most
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAT</ENAMEX> identifies a number of additional 
        Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> predicted to
        contain the same domain. For example, the
        ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which is important in protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>, identifies 6 unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'C</ENAMEX>' or above confidence, which contain similar domains. In
        contrast, no additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were found to have
        TBP-like (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TATA binding protein</ENAMEX>-like) domains.
        Recent structures not found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOLDLIB</ENAMEX> or SCOP (release
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.55</NUMEX>) were examined to see how well they were predicted by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iGAP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4b</ENAMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> structures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1gp4 and 1gp6</TIMEX> (putative
        leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, NCBI NR database <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 October</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> release), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">123D</TIMEX> was able to correctly predict the fold
        to be similar to 1hig (clavaminate synthase-like SCOP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST only gave a number of
        low-probability (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reliability</ENAMEX>) predictions.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> entry 1e6b (putative glutathione- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S -transferase</ENAMEX>, NCBI NR database <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2001</TIMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with an amino-terminal
        thioredoxin-like domain and a contiguous glutathione- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> -transferase carboxy-terminal
        domain. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">123D</ENAMEX> correctly recognized the
        template structure 1fw1 (glutathione transferase
        z/maleylacetoacetate isomerase). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST and 123D
        predicted the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to be thioredoxin-like with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> index of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> However, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST made two
        additional predictions, both correct. The 'pseudo SCOP
        entry by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAT</ENAMEX>' is a novel domain parsed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDP</ENAMEX>, which at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> was not in SCOP release <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.55</NUMEX>. (It is classified as a
        separate domain in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SCOP 1.59</NUMEX>.) This was recognized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST. Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST also recognized the
        amino-terminal thioredoxin-like domain with correct
        boundaries.
        Finally, the SCOP classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structures
        by fold (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4a</NUMEX>) and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>) provides a
        convenient way to catalog the relative occurrences of
        structures in 
        A. thaliana . With respect to folds,
        the membrane all-alpha fold, alpha-alpha superhelix and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX>-like (PK-like) fold ranked highest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIM</ENAMEX>
        barrel and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossman</ENAMEX> folds, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-bladed beta-propeller
        folds are also among the top folds. PK-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> highest occurrence at the superfamily level
        (data not shown). Not surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serine/threonine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX> and tyrosine kinases are among the most abundant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The PAT database was initially developed as a joint
        development of academia and industry to serve the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and plant proteomics
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> through the provision of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and functional
        assignment to all identified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the 
        Arabidopsis genome. The underlying
        technology, specifically iGAP and the associated
        reliability criteria, is well suited for application to
        other proteomes and this processing is ongoing to provide a
        comparative proteomics resource. With more of a focus on
        comparative proteomics, the resource is being expanded in
        an effort we refer to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia of Life</ENAMEX> (EOL).
        Details on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EOL</ENAMEX> can be found at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .

            SCOP domain sequences filtered at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> identity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
            ] are downloaded from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astral</ENAMEX> database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . PDB
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> are clustered at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> identity and parsed with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] to provide additional domains, including

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> processed. The sequences
            from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDP</ENAMEX> are then clustered at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>

            generated for use by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">123D</TIMEX> using PSI-BLAST with a
            default E-value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1e-6</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> iterations.
          
          
            The pipeline
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step of the pipeline uses a set of filter
            programs to determine the low-complexity regions as
            well as transmembrane regions, signal-peptide
            sequences, and coiled coils in a particular proteome.
            The programs used include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] for low-complexity
            region, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COILS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] for coiled coils, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMHMM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] for
            transmembrane region, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSORT</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] for subcellular
            location and signalP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] for signal peptides.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step determines sequence similarity hits
            by pairwise sequence comparison using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">W.</ENAMEX>
            Gish, personal communication). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WU</ENAMEX>-BLAST is used because
            it is fast and performed best in our benchmark studies.
            The default E-value used is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1e-5</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> step
            generates PSI-BLAST profiles for each input protein
            sequence against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOLDLIB</ENAMEX> sequences. The default
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-value used is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1e-6</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> iterations for profile
            generation. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> step, the program 123D is
            used to provide additional mapping to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOLDLIB</ENAMEX> using
            fold recognition [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . 123D has been used
            successfully in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CASP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] competitions.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliability</ENAMEX> index
            The reliability of a prediction is calculated on the
            basis of a novel benchmarking procedure against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX>
            and will be described elsewhere. The index is expressed
            as percent certainty that a particular prediction is
            correct: A = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> certainty, B = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> certainty, C =
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> certainty, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> certainty, and E = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
            certainty.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> browser
            The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> classifications provides a
            hierarchical view of the data from a structure
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> may start with the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-alpha class and drill down through fold,
            superfamily, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and domain level. Alternatively,
            the structure classification can be searched for terms
            such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossman</ENAMEX> fold" present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> annotation.
