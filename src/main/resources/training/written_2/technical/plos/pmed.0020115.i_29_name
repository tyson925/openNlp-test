        slowly died of type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1922</TIMEX>, the prognosis was changed
        dramatically when a teenager with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recorded
        recipient of an injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>. Although this preparation was far from perfect, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Banting</ENAMEX> said in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel</ENAMEX> lecture of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureates</ENAMEX> did not have to wait
        so long as they do now for recognition), “There was a marked reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood sugar</ENAMEX> and
        the urine was rendered sugar free.” Suddenly <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> was a potentially curable disease.
        But <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>'s very success brought trouble, as demand far exceeded the supply.
        Now recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is available in plentiful supply, but the control of type 1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> remains far from perfect, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have looked towards an ideal of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transplanting insulin</ENAMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> instead. The best protocol for this, also pioneered
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edmonton</ENAMEX> protocol, uses ß-cells isolated from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cadavers</ENAMEX> and has shown
        some remarkable results with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 84%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-free after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> still producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>. However, the isolation of
        ß-cells is laborious and limited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> availability.
        The next logical step, then, is to look for renewable sources of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-producing
        cells. The emerging science of human stem cell research makes this step possible, and in a
        paper in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> Seung <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> suggest
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> should look beyond just pancreatic precursors and embryonic stem cells to
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-type precursors for ideas about ß-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell replacement</ENAMEX>.
        The rationale for the approach in this study comes from observations that although the
        pancreatic islet cells are the principal source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, in some invertebrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, such as 
        Drosophila , most circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is produced by brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intriguingly</ENAMEX>, the gene encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is also transcribed by some vertebrate
        neurons—although it is not clear whether they then produce or secrete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin protein</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> took human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neural progenitor cells</ENAMEX> derived from brain, and exposed
        them to a series of signals that are known to drive pancreatic islet development. They were
        able to produce clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-producing cells that were responsive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX>. After transplantation into immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, circulating human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and
        C-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptide</ENAMEX> derived from the proinsulin precursor were detected when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>.
        Of course, results in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> do not mean that such treatments would automatically work in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and before any such therapies become available there are many hurdles to overcome.
        Some of the most important include the long-term stability and safety of the cells
        (although the cells remained differentiated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and did not form tumors, such a
        risk would need to be very thoroughly investigated because of the chronic nature of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>), and how to scale up such a process to produce the much larger numbers of cells
        needed for human treatment. Nonetheless, work like this study from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> might point
        to where the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> treatment lies.
