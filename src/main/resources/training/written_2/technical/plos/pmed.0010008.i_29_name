        Chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke causes progressive lung destruction in susceptible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, resulting in chronic obstructive pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (COPD) and emphysema, two
        well-described clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">syndromes</ENAMEX> with poorly understood pathogenesis [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>]. A role for T
        helper cells in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">obstructive lung disease</ENAMEX> has been established with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T helper 2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th2</NUMEX>) cells are strongly linked to both human and experimental
        disease [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5,6,7</NUMEX>]. A potential role for T cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> has also been suggested in several
        recent studies that show CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cells are increased in the lungs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who smoke [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9,10,11</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>
        cells cause tissue injury through their secreted products such as cytokines; in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
        overexpression of interleukin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IL</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>, a T cell cytokine that is strongly implicated in the
        pathogenesis of experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, resulted in increased production of proteases and
        enlargement of airspaces reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Further, airway limitation, another
        characteristic of human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>, is clinically linked to an accelerated rate of loss of lung
        function in smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. It has been suggested, therefore, that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and COPD
        may involve the same type of recruited inflammatory cells, differing only in their location
        within the lung [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        Chemokines, their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> adhesion molecules regulate migration of immune
        cells into inflamed tissue [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,16,17,18</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T helper 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th1</NUMEX>) cells have been shown to secrete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">interleukin 2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon gamma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Œ≥</ENAMEX>), and express a distinct repertoire of chemokine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR3</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,20,21</NUMEX>]. In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th2</NUMEX> cells that are biased to
        produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">IL-4</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-5</ENAMEX> express mainly CCR4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR3</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,23,24,25</NUMEX>]. Immunofluorescent
        analysis of airway mucosal biopsies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> showed that most T cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-express <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4 and CCR4</TIMEX>, but, in contrast, T cells in airways of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and
        pulmonary sarcoidosis produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IFN-Œ≥</ENAMEX> and express high levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR3</TIMEX>, while lacking CCR4
        expression [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. In addition to T cells, a wide variety of other inflammatory cells have
        been shown to express distinct chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that are critical for their homing,
        suggesting a universal mechanism for regulating immune responses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interferon</ENAMEX>-inducible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> (IP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>), monokine induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon gamma</ENAMEX> (MIG), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon-inducible T</ENAMEX>
        cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> known ligands for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CXCR3</ENAMEX> produced by normal and
        injured epithelial cells and T cells that are required for homing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Th1 cells</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,28,29</NUMEX>].
        In addition to regulation of chemotaxis and homing, other functions have been ascribed to
        chemokines, including modulation of T cell fate by direct effects on differentiating T
        cells, and regulation of proteolysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood monocytes</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,30</NUMEX>].
        In this study we determined the dominant T helper phenotype in lung samples from
        ex-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with moderate to severe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and emphysema and control individuals
        with no evidence of smoking-related lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor expression
        on isolated peripheral lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> from ex-smokers with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">COPD</ENAMEX>/emphysema indicated that
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8 T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helper cells</ENAMEX> are strongly polarized to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th1</NUMEX> phenotype compared to T
        cells isolated from lung tissue of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        non-smoking-related obstructive lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The same cells spontaneously secreted more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥ and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CXCR3 receptor</ENAMEX> ligands MIG and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and emphysema <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> without emphysema. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> and MIG, but not IFN-Œ≥, upregulated macrophage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloelastase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix metalloproteinase</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX>]-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) from isolated lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macrophages</ENAMEX>.
        Together, our findings reveal the strong association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>/emphysema- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX>-driven
        adaptive immunity, suggesting a link to lung destruction mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥, MIG, and
        IP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-eight</NUMEX> non-atopic ex-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) undergoing medically
          necessary lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">resection</ENAMEX> were serially entered into the study: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and no evidence of emphysema (control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eighteen individuals</ENAMEX> (diseased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>) with moderate to severe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and evidence of emphysema as determined by pulmonary
          function tests, high-resolution computed tomography (CT), or conventional CT scan. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were ex-smokers who had quit smoking for a mean (SD) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) y and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) y
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>/emphysema and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> was diagnosed according to the
          criteria recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health/World Health Organization</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workshop</ENAMEX> summary [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> in the control and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">COPD</ENAMEX>/emphysema <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had similar
          (mean [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>] of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], respectively) ‚Äúpack-year‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Äù smoking histories</ENAMEX>, where
          smoking one pack of cigarettes per day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> is defined as one pack<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year</TIMEX>.
          All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were recruited from the surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael E. DeBakey</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Affairs Medical Center</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodist Hospital</ENAMEX>, and were undergoing lung
          resection for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Study protocols were approved
          by the institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> for human studies, and informed consent was obtained
          from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> had no history of allergy or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and had not
          received oral/systemic corticosteroids during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last 6 mo. At the time</TIMEX> of study, all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had been free of acute symptoms suggestive of upper or lower respiratory
          tract infection for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk preceding the study.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CT</ENAMEX>-Based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evaluation</ENAMEX> for Emphysema
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High-resolution CT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in emphysema <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) or conventional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> analysis was used to detect emphysema, characterized by the presence of areas of low
          attenuation contrasted with surrounding normal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,33</NUMEX>]. CT scans were
          used by a radiologist to separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> on the basis of the presence or the
          absence of any objective evidence for centrilobular, panacinar, or paraseptal emphysema
          with a detection limit of greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-mm</ENAMEX> low attenuation density [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung Lymphocytes</ENAMEX>
          Lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> were isolated by modifying established protocols, using a combination
          of mechanical fragmentation, enzyme digestion, and centrifugation procedures described
          previously [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,36,37</NUMEX>]. Viable lymphocytes were separated from whole lung inflammatory
          cells (macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils) using an immunomagnetic positive
          separation technique (autoMACS, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>).
          Briefly, lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukocytes</ENAMEX> were labeled with paramagnetic bead-conjugated anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-CD19</TIMEX>,
          and -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD56</NUMEX> to positively select <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>, B, and NK cells, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s
          instructions. Each of the harvested cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> was used directly for in vitro

          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCL7</NUMEX>), and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CCL17</NUMEX>) [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40,41]‚Äîand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR3</ENAMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for eotaxin and related chemokines. Flow cytometry revealed very low expression
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR3 and CCR4</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì3%</NUMEX>) in control (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) and emphysema (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and did not discriminate between these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A and 1B</TIMEX>; data not shown). These findings were in sharp contrast to the enhanced
          expression of both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5 and CXCR3</TIMEX>, as shown in representative histograms (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>).
          These Th1-specific chemokine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were expressed prominently on lung lymphocytes
          from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, but their expression was significantly enhanced in the setting of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1A‚Äì1C</ENAMEX>). Further, both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD8 T</ENAMEX> cells expressed CCR5 at the same
          level (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>). In contrast, we found highly variable expression (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì30%</NUMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR4</TIMEX>,
          CXCR3, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR5</ENAMEX> on peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, and
          this variation did not correlate with the presence of disease in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). Furthermore, we compared the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocyte</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5 and CXCR3</TIMEX> profiles among the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with emphysema alone (lung volume reduction surgery for emphysema;
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with emphysema and accompanying <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (lung resection
          for treatment of small peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>), and found that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> cannot be
          distinguished based on these indices (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1D</TIMEX>; data not shown).
          Although human lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macrophages</ENAMEX> are not known to express <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR3</TIMEX>, we suspected based on
          the immunohistochemical localization of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptor</ENAMEX> that CD14
          + cells in the lungs of ex-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with emphysema accounted
          for much of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> CXCR3
          + immunoreactivity (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>; data not shown). To confirm this, we
          determined the percent of total lung cells expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD14 and CD11b‚Äîwhich</TIMEX> are both
          markers of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">monocytes/macrophages‚Äîand CXCR3.</ENAMEX> We found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 40%</NUMEX> of CD14
          + cells from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with emphysema but not control participants
          were also positive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR3</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In addition, there was a significant negative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between CXCR3</TIMEX> expression on lung T cells and the percent of predicted forced
          expiratory volume in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> s (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FEV1</NUMEX>), based on an 
          R
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> goodness-of-fit statistic of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.27</NUMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0089</NUMEX>, 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">‚àí0.52</NUMEX>). Together, these data indicate that a strong type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> bias is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">characteristic of the T</ENAMEX> cells isolated from the peripheral lung of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with COPD
          and emphysema and that this immune phenotype correlates with the lung destruction that is
          characteristic of this disease. Further, we have shown for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, to our
          knowledge, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CXCR3</ENAMEX> expression, a marker of Th1 inflammation, extends to lung monocytes
          and macrophages.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, and MIG But Not IL-4 Are Expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung Lymphocytes</ENAMEX>
          We sought additional functional data to confirm the apparent Th1 bias of peripheral
          lung inflammatory cells isolated from ex-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Freshly isolated lung
          lymphocytes that were not otherwise manipulated secreted high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥, MIG, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, with significantly greater secretion of both cytokines from lymphocytes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with emphysema (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3A‚Äì3C</ENAMEX>). Interestingly, we could not detect
          appreciable amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-TAC</ENAMEX>, another known ligand for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR3</TIMEX>, in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> or those with emphysema (data not shown). Similar results were
          obtained using intracytoplasmic cytokine staining of the same cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>), in which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>/ionomycin stimulation strongly induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-Œ≥</ENAMEX> production from CD69
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ /</ENAMEX>CD8
          + lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX>. Surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">staining</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> was not feasible with
          this protocol; however, the percentage of CD8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚àí /IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥
          + cells was approximately equal to that of CD8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ /IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥
          + cells (median [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], respectively). Because total
          numbers of CD4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> and CD8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cells were approximately equivalent, this suggests that non-CD8
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ /IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥
          + cells are largely CD4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> , and therefore Th1 cells. Finally, the typical Th2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytokine</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>,
          was not detected in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or
          intracytoplasmic cytokine staining (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3E</TIMEX>; data not shown), confirming the marked Th1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> of the immune response that underlies smoking-related lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inflammation</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> and MIG But Not <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-Œ≥ Directly Upregulate MMP12</ENAMEX> through CXCR3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emphysema</ENAMEX> and irreversible airway limitation that is characteristic of chronic tobacco
          smoking are related to the destruction of elastin and the resulting loss of lung elastic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recoil</ENAMEX>. Therefore, to be relevant to the pathogenesis of airway obstruction, type 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inflammation</ENAMEX> must be shown to promote lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">elastolysis</ENAMEX>. Because loss of elastin is
          regulated by proteinases [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], we next determined if expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>, in particular
          the elastases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP9 and MMP12</TIMEX>, was regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IP-10</ENAMEX>, MIG, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Œ≥, the principal
          cytokines detected in emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>. Indeed, isolated peripheral lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macrophages</ENAMEX>,
          but not isolated blood monocytes, secreted MMP12 in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> and MIG, but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IFN-Œ≥</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A</TIMEX>; data not shown). These findings reflect a specific receptor‚Äìligand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> because in the presence of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CXCR3</NUMEX> function-blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> failed
          to induce MMP12 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies revealed that lung
          macrophages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with emphysema, but not control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, specifically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">express MMP12</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4C and 4D</TIMEX>). Together, these findings indicate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th1</TIMEX>, but not
          Th2, cytokines and related chemokines are required for establishing the pro-elastolytic
          lung environment that underlies human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this investigation, we characterized T cells and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macrophages</ENAMEX> isolated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysematous</ENAMEX> and non-emphysematous human lungs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> principal findings emerge from our
        study. First, rather than being functionally diverse, as suggested by the heterogeneous
        nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, lung T cells of ex-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with emphysema are relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneous</ENAMEX> and characterized by a marked Th1 bias. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Th1 chemokines</ENAMEX>,
        MIG and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, are linked to a pro-elastolytic lung environment because these cytokines
        upregulate the elastase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP12</TIMEX>, which is associated with emphysema. Finally, we found no
        significant expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Th2 chemokine receptors</ENAMEX>, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR3 and CCR4</TIMEX>, or IL-4
        production in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX>. Together, our findings demonstrate the role of the adaptive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and suggest a primary role for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Th1 cells</ENAMEX> in controlling the main
        smoking-related physiologic and structural changes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>.
        Upregulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CCR5 and CXCR3</TIMEX> on T cells and accumulation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the lung
        periphery suggest that aberrant, unremitting pulmonary recruitment of these activated T
        cells is unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with smoking-related lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, despite cessation of exposure
        to the inciting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, tobacco smoke. We showed that ex-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> without
        obstructive lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or emphysema have comparatively little Th1-biased inflammation in
        their lungs; thus, our findings reflect the inflammatory changes that are unique to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> microenvironment. Additionally, lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> lifelong
        non-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with severe obstructive lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> due to cystic fibrosis or
        bronchiolitis obliterans did not show a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Th1</NUMEX> inflammatory bias of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Grumelli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>
        Kheradmand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. B. Corry</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). This information confirmed our finding that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">predominant Th1</ENAMEX> bias in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>/emphysema reflects the microenvironment unique to the lungs of
        ex-smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who smoke is currently not
        known, but in order to study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>/emphysema in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> without other confounding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who might have had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> were excluded, and thus our findings are
        restricted to non-asthmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with emphysema.
        Our use of T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor expression analysis to determine recruitment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lung T</ENAMEX> cells is not without precedent. Analysis by immunohistochemistry of airway mucosa of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">atopic asthma</ENAMEX> after antigen challenge revealed that large numbers of CCR4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> and CCR8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cells express <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR4</ENAMEX> expression was prominent in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
        severe atopic dermatitis, which decreased upon abatement of disease activity [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,43</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunostaining of T</ENAMEX> cells in synovial fluid from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>
        showed that virtually all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells associated with inflamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> expressed CXCR3
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR5</ENAMEX>, representing significant enrichment compared to blood T cells from the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, previous studies of smoker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and normal lung
        function showed the presence of CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ /</ENAMEX>CXCR3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cells in the airway epithelium and submucosa [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. We extend these
        findings by showing CXCR3 expression on lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macrophages</ENAMEX> and CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cells in emphysema <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the functional interplay between
        Th1-related chemokines and elastolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to detailing surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor expression, we have functionally
        confirmed the marked Th1 bias of peripheral lung T cells, demonstrating that either at rest
        or following stimulation, these cells secrete IFN-Œ≥ and not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IL-4</TIMEX>. Our findings therefore
        confirm the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine</ENAMEX> receptor expression patterns in the initial assessment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell effector phenotype.
        Destruction of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> in emphysema is thought to occur through excessive
        proteolysis mediated by the elastin-degrading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">enzymes MMP2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP9</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP12</ENAMEX> from the MMP
        family, and by neutrophil elastase from the serine proteinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45,46</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytokines</ENAMEX> and
        chemokines are substrates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>, but they also regulate expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> under
        pathological conditions [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47,48</NUMEX>]. We have shown here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX> and MIG, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chemokines that
        are secreted from lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with emphysema, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">upregulate</ENAMEX> specifically
        MMP12 and thus favor a proteolytic microenvironment that facilitates lung destruction.
        Strengthening the association between lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macrophages</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10/MIG-dependent</ENAMEX> MMP12
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> is the fact that we have demonstrated that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> macrophages, like T cells,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">express CXCR3</ENAMEX> and that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP12</TIMEX> secretion in response to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10/MIG</ENAMEX> stimulation. In addition to defining the predominant immune phenotype of
        emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, these additional findings implicate the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (macrophage),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MMP12</NUMEX>), and effector cytokines (IFN-Œ≥, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IP-10</ENAMEX>, and MIG) as likely underlying
        smoking-induced lung destruction. We have further shown that these enzymes may be regulated
        by proximal immune events driven by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX> cells or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX>-associated cytokines. A question of
        major importance for future study is, therefore, the nature of the antigens and adjuvant
        factors that ultimately drive this inflammatory response.
        Although this was an entirely human study, our findings show remarkable parallels with
        studies performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. MMP12 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> has been shown to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, implying that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP12</TIMEX> may be the key
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteinase</ENAMEX> in the development of emphysema in this species [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49,50</NUMEX>]. Studies from both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> therefore firmly suggest the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMP12</ENAMEX> in the pathogenesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, in addition to solubilizing elastin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MMP12</ENAMEX> is the MMP most
        efficient at degrading <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Œ±1</NUMEX>-antitrypsin, the primary physiological inhibitor of human
        leukocyte elastase [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51,52</NUMEX>]. Thus, chemokine-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">upregulation</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MMP12</TIMEX> may orchestrate
        lung matrix degradation both directly and indirectly through inactivation of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Œ±1-antitrypsin.</TIMEX> The therapy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and emphysema is currently limited to pharmacologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchodilation</ENAMEX> to relieve dyspnea, antibiotics for intercurrent respiratory tract
        infection, and vaccination against prominent respiratory pathogens. Aside from efforts to
        prevent smoking or encourage cessation, there exist no measures that prevent development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> or treat the specific causes of airway obstruction. By providing insight into the
        immunopathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>, our findings provide genuine hope that future therapies capable
        of preventing or halting smoking-related lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> may be possible.
