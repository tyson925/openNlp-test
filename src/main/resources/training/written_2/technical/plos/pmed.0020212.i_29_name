        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provocative</ENAMEX> as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX>. There has been progress on several fronts, but
        particularly regarding the molecular genetics of this complex disorder of mind and brain.
        At the same time, a number of critically important and unresolved issues remain that
        qualify the ultimate clinical and scientific validity of the results. However, the recent
        progress in this historically difficult area of inquiry does not seem to be widely
        appreciated. The purpose of this article is to provide a high-level review of progress, its
        limitations, and the implications for clinical research and clinical practice.
        The public health importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is clear. The median lifetime prevalence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7‚Äì0.8%</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], with onset typically ranging from adolescence to early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX> and a course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> typified by exacerbations, remissions, and substantial
        residual symptoms and functional impairment [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morbidity</ENAMEX> is substantial, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> ranks <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> in global burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is
        often comorbid with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> dependence (principally <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, nicotine, cannabis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>)
        and important medical conditions (obesity, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Mortality due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natural</ENAMEX> and unnatural causes is considerable, and the projected lifespan for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 15 years</TIMEX> less than the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. The personal,
        familial, and societal costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> are enormous.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etiological Clues</ENAMEX>
        A substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of epidemiological research has established a set of risk factors for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. A subset of this work is summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Of a large set of pre- and
        antenatal risk factors [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], having a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-degree relative with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is associated
        with an odds ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost ten</NUMEX>. The general impact of some of the risk factors in Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> remains uncertain, and, additionally, migrant status, urban residence, cannabis use, and
        biological sex are supported as risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. Although the attributable
        risk of some of these risk factors may be greater (e.g., place and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> of birth) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>],
        the size of the odds ratio for family history suggests that searching for the familial
        determinants of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is rational for etiological research.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unpacking the Family History Risk Factor</ENAMEX>
        Studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, adoptees, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> have been widely used to attempt to understand
        the relative contributions of genetic and environmental effects upon risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúold genetics‚</ENAMEX>Äù approaches use phenotypic resemblance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> as
        an indirect means by which to infer the roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and environment. There are many
        important assumptions and methodological issues with these studies [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]; however, genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> have yielded a remarkably consistent set of
        findings, as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>].
        To summarize this literature briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is familial, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúruns‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
        Both adoption and twin studies indicate that the familiality of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is due mainly
        to genetic effects. Twin studies suggest the relevance of small but significant shared
        environmental influences that are likely prenatal in origin. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is best
        viewed as a complex trait resulting from both genetic and environmental etiological
        influences. These results are only broadly informative, as they provide no information
        about the location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or the identity of the environmental factors that
        predispose or protect against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. Searching for genetic influences that mediate
        vulnerability to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is rational, given the larger overall effect size and lesser
        error of measurement in comparison to typical assessments of environmental effects. Note
        that high heritability is no guarantee of success in efforts to identify candidate
        genes.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomewide Linkage Studies of Schizophrenia</ENAMEX>
        Modern genotyping technologies and statistical analyses have enabled the discovery of
        genetic loci related to the etiology of many complex traits [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> 2 diabetes
        mellitus, obesity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdiscovery science‚</ENAMEX>Äù approaches have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>, and are summarized in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> samples shown here
        included from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">294</NUMEX> multiplex pedigrees (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glossary</ENAMEX>) (median <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34</NUMEX>) containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">669</NUMEX> (median <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">101</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> affected with a narrow definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. There were
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">310 to 950</TIMEX> (median <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">392</NUMEX>) genetic markers in the first-stage genome scans.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúHard‚Äù replication‚Äîimplication</ENAMEX> of the same markers, alleles, and haplotypes in the
        majority of samples‚Äîis elusive. It is evident from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> that these studies are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inconsistent</ENAMEX>, and no genomic region was implicated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> samples. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis et al. meta</ENAMEX>-analysis [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] included most of the studies in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and found that one
        region on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chromosome 2</ENAMEX> was stringently significant and several additional regions neared
        significance. Our focus on first-stage genome scans does not adequately capture the
        evidence supporting replication for certain regions (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6p</TIMEX>) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13‚Äì18</NUMEX>]. However, there
        appears to be ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Äúsoft‚Äù replication</ENAMEX> across studies.
        It is unlikely that all of these linkage findings are true. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> suggested by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis et al. meta</ENAMEX>-analysis implicate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> of all known genes). For
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the percentages of all known genes implicated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3,</ENAMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> linkage studies were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>, respectively. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> summation
        suggests that linkage analysis is an imprecise tool‚Äîimplausibly large numbers of genes are
        implicated and few genes are consistently identified in more than a small subset of
        studies.
        There are several potential reasons why clear-cut or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúhard‚Äù replication</ENAMEX> was not found.
        With respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that conducted these enormously effortful studies, it is possible
        that no study possessed sufficient statistical power to detect the subtle genetic effects
        suspected for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. For example, it would require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,900 pedigrees</NUMEX> to have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>
        power to detect a locus accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of variance in liability to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> at Œ± =
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>. These calculations make highly optimistic assumptions, and less favorable
        assumptions can lead to sample size requirements above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50,000 sibling</NUMEX> pairs. For
        comparison, the total number of pedigrees in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 2,000</NUMEX>.
        In addition, it is possible that etiological heterogeneity (different combinations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> and environmental causes between samples) and technical differences (different
        ascertainment, assessment, genotyping, and statistical analysis between samples)
        contributed; however, their impact is uncertain, whereas insufficient power is clear. If
        correct, the implication is that Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> contains a mix of true and false positive
        findings.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association Studies of Schizophrenia</ENAMEX>
        Schizophrenia‚Äîlike most other complex traits in biomedicine‚Äîhas had a large number of
        genetic case-control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Although research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> is changing,
        interpretation of many studies is hindered by small sample sizes and a tendency to genotype
        a single genetic marker of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> that might be available in a gene. For example, a
        widely studied functional genetic marker in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">rs4680</NUMEX>) is probably not associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>], but
        nearby genetic markers assessed in a minority of studies may be [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        However, as discussed in the next section, a number of methodologically adequate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> appear to support the role of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes
        in the etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. Similar to the linkage study data, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúhard‚Äù replication</ENAMEX>
        remains elusive.
      
      
        Synthesis
        Despite the limitations of the accumulated linkage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies, there are
        good suggestions that these studies have identified plausible candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> summarizes the evidence in support of a set of possible candidate
        genes for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. Reports supporting the role of many of these genes have appeared
        in top-tier international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> known for rigorous peer review. The evidence for several
        genes is encouraging but currently insufficient to declare any a clear-cut cause of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>.
        The accumulated data provide particular support for 
        DISC1 , 
        DTNBP1 , 
        NRG1 , and 
        RGS4 . Each of these genes has received support from multiple lines of
        evidence with imperfect consistency: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The case for each of these as a candidate gene for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is supported by linkage studies; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) The preponderance of association study
        findings provides further support; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) mRNA from each gene is expressed in the prefrontal
        cortex as well as in other areas of the brain; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) Additional neurobiological data link
        the functions of these genes to biological processes thought to be related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>. For example, 
        DISC1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modulates</ENAMEX> neurite outgrowth, there is an extensive literature on
        the involvement of 
        NRG1 in the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>, and 
        RGS4 may modulate intracellular signaling for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Moreover, 
        DTNBP1 and 
        RGS4 have been reported to be differentially expressed in postmortem
        brain samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>.
        This encouraging summation of work in progress masks a critical issue‚Äîthe lack or
        consistent replication for the same markers and haplotypes across studies. The literature
        supports the contention that genetic variation in these genes is associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>, but it lacks impressive consistency in the precise genetic regions and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> implicated. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies of other complex human genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> have produced unambiguous, consistent, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">clear-cut (‚Äúhard‚Äù</ENAMEX>) replication. For
        example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Type</ENAMEX> 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>, the bulk of both the linkage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> data
        implicate the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HLA</ENAMEX> region and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type 2 diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX>, there are a number of findings
        in the literature where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> evidence appears to be consistent and compelling (
        CAPN10 , 
        KCNJ11 , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PPARG )‚Äîthe</ENAMEX> data indicate that the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker allele</ENAMEX> is significantly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> and has an effect size of similar direction and magnitude [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] (the linkage data
        are less congruent, probably due to power considerations); and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) for age-related macular
        degeneration, at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> studies show highly significant association with the same 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y402H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23‚Äì27</NUMEX>] in a region strongly implicated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple linkage</ENAMEX> studies. For these findings, the data are highly compelling and consistent
        and provide a solid foundation for the next generation of studies to investigate the
        mechanisms of the gene‚Äìphenotype connection. Power/type 2 error appears to be a major
        factor‚Äîif the genetic effect is sufficiently large (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Type</ENAMEX> 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX> or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFH</ENAMEX> in age-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macular degeneration)‚Äîor</ENAMEX>, if the sample size is large,
        then there appears to be a greater chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúhard‚Äù replication</ENAMEX>.
        At present, the data for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> are confusing, and there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broad
        possibilities. The first possibility is that the current findings for some of the best
        current genes are true. This implies that the genetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> are different from
        other complex traits in the existence of very high degrees of etiological heterogeneity:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is hyper-complex, and we need to invoke more complicated genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> than
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biomedical disorders</ENAMEX>. The alternative possibility is that the current findings are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">clouded by Type 1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> 2 error. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is similar to other complex traits: it is
        possible that there are kernels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>, but it is highly likely that there is a lot of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chaff</ENAMEX>. At present, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and more parsimonious possibility has not been rigorously
        excluded. The impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> 1/Type 2 error is likely, and it is not clear why
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> should be inherently more complex. At present, we cannot resolve these
        possibilities.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health Implications</ENAMEX>
        The public health importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is clear, and the rationale for the search
        for genetic causes is strong. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Schizophrenia</ENAMEX> research has never been easy: the current epoch
        of investigation into the genetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> provides a set of tantalizing clues,
        but definitive answers are not yet fully established. Findings from the accumulated
        literature appear to be more than chance yet sufficiently variable as to render ‚Äúhard‚Äù
        replication elusive. The currently murky view of this literature may result from the
        competing filters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Type 1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> 2 error. The current literature could be a mix of true
        and false positive findings; however, it would be a momentous advance for the field if even
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> were a true positive result.
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of work is not yet ready for wholesale translation into clinical practice.
        However, it is not premature to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that this work is advancing and that it
        holds promise for new insights into etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year</TIMEX> horizon. On a larger scale, the treatment of the mentally ill mirrors the
        humanity of a society; in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, the return image is not flattering. If a specific
        genetic variation were proven to be causal to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>, this poor reflection might
        improve [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
