        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umwelt</ENAMEX> to describe the subjective world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The world that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> perceive is not an objective, veridical representation of the physical world, he
        argued, but is instead a product of the particular sense organs that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has
        acquired in its evolutionary history [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have sensory abilities that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
        don't, such as a magnetic compass sense in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] or sensitivity to electric fields in
        fish [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. But even within sensory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modalities</ENAMEX> shared by many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, such as vision,
        hearing, and olfaction, there are strong differences between species. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>,
        but not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, can see UV light [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>] and smell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bats</ENAMEX> can hear
        ultrasound [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. But what exactly is the structure of the perceptual worlds proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uexk√ºll</ENAMEX>? Can we draw them on paper in the form of maps, allowing us to visualize a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">particular animal</ENAMEX>'s subjective view of the world? Will such maps allow us to predict the
        similarity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stimuli (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> colors or two scents) by inspecting the distance
        between the loci they produce in a perceptual space? Does understanding the metrics of such
        maps help us predict how stimulus mixtures will be perceived?
        Even though perceptual sensations may strike us as ethereal, they must be based on
        patterns of activity in neuronal hardware‚Äîthus, we need to look into the brains of animals
        to see how the neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circuitry</ENAMEX> processes the information from the sense organs. The
        study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerrieri et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] on odor space in honeybees in this issue is an excellent
        example of how behavioral studies can be paired with neurobiological data to access the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">perceptual</ENAMEX> space of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. Here, we contrast the complexity of scent perception with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> examples of simpler perceptual worlds, vertebrate frequency perception and bee color
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Perception of Pitch</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auditory System</ENAMEX>
        Sound is a mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vibration</ENAMEX> whose most defining characteristic is neatly arranged
        along <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one dimension‚Äîfrequency</NUMEX> (of waves with alternating high and low pressure). The
        mechanical structure of our inner ear tidily maps the frequency of sound onto different
        positions of the basilar membrane in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail</ENAMEX>-shaped cochlea [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The width and
        flexibility of this membrane increases with distance from the oval window (the point of
        entry of sound). The result is that, when the frequency of sound is high, it will produce a
        peak of vibration near the oval window (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>); if the frequency is low, the peak of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vibration</ENAMEX> will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer</NUMEX> the far (apical) end of the cochlea [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. In this sense, the
        cochlea processes sound similarly to how a prism acts on white light [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]: it decomposes
        mixtures of sound frequencies into their components, and maps them onto different spatial
        positions within the cochlea. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of mechanoreceptors distributed along the
        basilar membrane need not be tuned to different frequencies, as in color vision, where each
        receptor type responds most strongly in a particular wavelength range. It is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanoreceptors</ENAMEX>' position in the cochlea that determines which sound frequency will
        maximally stimulate them [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,12</NUMEX>]. This structure is maintained on a higher processing
        level: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the auditory cranial nerve send the information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> to
        the brain in parallel, i.e., in a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> approximation, each receptor cell has its own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neuronal ‚Äúcable‚Äù</ENAMEX> to the cochlear nuclei, and beyond, to the auditory cortex, where we find
        a complete topographical map of the audible frequency spectrum (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>), mirroring the
        mapping of frequencies in the cochlea [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,13,14</NUMEX>]. The perception of pitch, then, is
        arranged along <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dimension, as on a piano keyboard. Because of the parallel processing of
        receptor information from the cochlea, we can hear mixtures of different frequencies, and
        analyze their components accurately, unless mixtures are very complex. We can identify the
        tones that a chord is made up of [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. There are, of course, cases where mixtures have
        unique properties, e.g., in the case of the intensities of harmonic overtones (integer
        multiples of the fundamental frequency) that distinguish a C tone produced by a guitar from
        that of a flute‚Äîbut we can still identify the fundamental, whose perceived pitch is not
        altered by the overtones. We would never perceive a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">400 Hz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">800 Hz</ENAMEX> as an
        intermediate frequency (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Perception</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bees</ENAMEX>
        While these observations are seemingly trivial in the world of sound, the perception of
        mixtures in color vision is fundamentally different. If we mix yellow with red light, we
        will see orange‚Äînot only will we not be able to tell that the orange light has been
        produced by mixing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lights, but we will also be unable to distinguish the mixture from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">monochromatic</ENAMEX> orange light [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Similar mixture phenomena are well established in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>;
        for example, orange light (with a wavelength of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">590 nm</NUMEX>) can be mixed with blue light (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">440</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>) to produce a mixture that is indistinguishable from monochromatic bluegreen light (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">490</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,18</NUMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the perception of hues is arranged in a circular
        fashion around achromatic white or gray [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. In this circular arrangement, complementary
        colors (i.e., those opposite on a circle) can be additively mixed to generate a neutral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulus</ENAMEX>, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV</ENAMEX> light (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">350 nm</NUMEX>) mixed in the appropriate ratio with bluegreen light (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">490</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>) will be perceived as white by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. In the auditory system, mixing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
        frequencies to produce the perception of white noise is inconceivable! Finally, the
        circular arrangement of hues also implies that it is possible to mix <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ends of the
        perceptible spectrum to produce a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> that is not contained in the spectrum: for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, mixing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">violet</ENAMEX> with red light will produce purple, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> that has no
        equivalent in the visual spectrum; a similar unique percept can be produced by facing bees
        with a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> and green light [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,17</NUMEX>].
        We (and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>) can only ever see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> color in a point; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> color mixtures
        are perceived as intermediates of their generative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, and it is not possible to
        identify the physical components of a mixture (e.g., the perception of white can be
        generated mixing any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complementary colors). In contrast, we can hear several
        frequencies at once, and identify the components of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least</NUMEX> simple stimulus mixtures such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triads</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In color vision, but not in hearing, multiple combinations of physical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimuli</ENAMEX> will generate identical sensations. The reasons for these fundamental differences
        between the visual and the auditory sensory modalities can be attributed in a
        straightforward way to the structure of the sense organs as well as post-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> neural
        circuits.
        In color vision, there aren't <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> each responsible for receiving
        a narrow range of wavelengths (as there are in the auditory system, with its technique of
        frequency analysis). Instead, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> color receptor types,
        each sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). Human color <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are
        typically termed blue, green, and red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, while those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> are most sensitive to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX>, blue, and green light [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,20</NUMEX>]. A single receptor cannot analyze the wavelength of the
        light it receives: it simply acts as a quantum counter, but the information about the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">wavelength</ENAMEX> identity of the quantum is lost on absorption. Any single photoreceptor might
        respond equally to a medium intensity light in the wavelength range of its peak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, and to a strong intensity light at the periphery of its sensitive range‚Äîhence
        it cannot disentangle wavelength from intensity [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        This means that the visual system has to compare the signals from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors differing</ENAMEX> in
        spectral sensitivity. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> as well as in vertebrates, it does this by means of color
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent neurons</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,21,22</NUMEX>]. The minimum equipment for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> color
        receptor types is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of opponent neuron, receiving antagonistic inputs from the two
        types of cells. Using such an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> mechanism, the visual system can ‚Äútell‚Äù whether
        there is a stronger signal from the short wavelength <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> or the long wavelength
        receptor‚Äîhence it can extract information about stimulus spectral quality. Theoretically,
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> with n color receptor types needs 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n &minus</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> chromatic opponent mechanisms [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Indeed, behavioral
        experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> have shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> color opponent mechanisms are necessary to
        explain color discrimination data [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,24</NUMEX>]. It is not clear which ones these
        are‚Äîphysiologists have found at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> different types of color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> neurons in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bee optic lobes</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,18,21</NUMEX>], and modeling has shown that almost any combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> neuron types is adequate for color coding [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        Nevertheless, the two-dimensional color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> space whose axes correspond to
        excitation patterns of color opponent mechanisms (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) has proven extremely useful:
        distances in such a color space correlate well with behavioral color discrimination data.
        The color <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> space allows us to predict hue (by assessing angular position) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> (by measuring distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>), and it can be used to predict the
        perception of color mixtures, which fall between the loci of the colors used to generate
        the mixture [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Because information about the actual receptor signals is discarded in the
        very periphery of the sensory system, perception is only based on derived (color opponency)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>, which measure differences in receptor signals rather than absolute signals.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Olfactory Perceptual Space</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bees</ENAMEX>
        Making sense of scents is a considerably messier affair. Odors are hardly presentable on
        a physical continuum (like the wavelength of light); they are multidimensional entities
        that can vary from small gaseous molecules to long-chained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hydrocarbons</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,26</NUMEX>]. Organic
        compounds vary in carbon chain length and functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, i.e., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of atoms that
        give substances their characteristic properties (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alkanes</ENAMEX>). At any moment, the air around an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> may contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airborne</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, which fluctuate with wind, humidity, and multiple other factors
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>].
        On the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> level, the olfactory system shows a complexity that is unparalleled in
        any color vision system: the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> discovered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel laureates L. Buck</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Axel</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor proteins</ENAMEX> in mammals, each of which only binds a
        narrow range of airborne molecules [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,28</NUMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is expressed per
        receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, so that there are indeed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">odor</ENAMEX> receptor cell types in
        the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">olfactory</ENAMEX> epithelium [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, the diversity of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is
        lower, but still impressive: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> flies appear to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">odorant</ENAMEX> receptor genes
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. In honeybees, the number of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be accessible pending the publication of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">honeybee genome</ENAMEX>; so far, screens by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Robertson</ENAMEX> (pers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comm</ENAMEX>.) indicate a number
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">>130</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 60,000</NUMEX> olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> (of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX> different types) are
        distributed along the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honeybee antennae</ENAMEX> ([<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). How can the brain extract
        biologically useful information from such multidimensional sensory input?
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> neuronal center of olfactory information processing, the antennal lobe (or its
        mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">analogue</ENAMEX>, the olfactory bulb) achieves order in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. First, axons from like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> (i.e., those that express the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor protein</ENAMEX> and therefore bind the
        same odorants) project to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few glomeruli</NUMEX>, i.e., globular, anatomically distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> within the antennal lobe [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">glomeruli</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX>, and corresponds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> to the number of putative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor types
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">honeybee</ENAMEX>'s antennal lobe contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160 glomeruli</NUMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Individual chemicals
        reliably activate sets of identified glomeruli [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. These micro-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">relays</NUMEX> sum up the input
        from same chemoreceptors, tremendously increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and thus
        facilitating reliable odorant detection [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and perhaps more remarkable, feature of the antennal lobe is that glomeruli
        coding for similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> are located close together, while those that code for
        distinct scents are spatially segregated [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,32,33,34</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> length, for example,
        is neatly represented in this glomerular map [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. How the brain achieves such ‚Äúchemical
        mapping‚Äù is something of a miracle: how would the developing brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúknow‚Äù</ENAMEX> which axons
        belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that respond to chemically similar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, so that these can be
        wired to neighboring glomeruli? In mammals, it was recently found that the receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind odor molecules are also expressed in the axon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> of the receptor
        cells [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. If we assume that similar receptor molecules bind similar odorants, then the
        developing nervous system could use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> molecule similarity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX>'
        axon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> to wire up the neural map in the antennal lobe.
        But does this neuronal activity map indeed correspond to the olfactory perceptual space?
        Theoretically, a perceptual space might have as many dimensions as there are distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor types‚</ENAMEX>Äîor it might have as many axes as there are glomeruli with distinct response
        profiles. Is it possible that olfactory space in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, then, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several dozen</NUMEX> dimensions?
        To evaluate the structure of olfactory perceptual space, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerrieri et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] trained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">honeybees</ENAMEX> to memorize a wide variety of odors, and then tested how well <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> could
        distinguish these odors from others. They then asked: how many axes must the olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">perceptual</ENAMEX> space have, so that distances between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">odors</ENAMEX> can be used to predict how similar
        they will appear to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>? They found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multidimensional</ENAMEX> receptor space might be
        collapsed onto very few perceptual axes: much of the similarity judgments between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">odors</ENAMEX> can
        be explained by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensional space (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). The most important axis spreads out
        scents according to carbon chain length, whereas the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> axes separate the odors
        according to functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, i.e., they separate primary and secondary alcohols,
        aldehydes, and ketones. Distances between odor loci in this three-dimensional space
        correlate well with the discriminability of the odors to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>. They also correspond to the
        similarity of activation patterns of the glomerular map [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], although the actual
        mechanisms that evaluate this similarity remain to be identified. There are a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complications</ENAMEX>, however, that indicate that the olfactory perceptual space is unlikely to
        submit to the relatively simple rules of perception of color and pitch.
        Take mixtures of different stimuli, for example. If odor perception followed rules
        similar to those of color perception, and if it relied exclusively on derived parameters
        (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> chain length), then mixtures would be perceived as intermediates of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. A mixture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules differing only in carbon chain length would be
        perceived as indistinguishable from a single odorant with an intermediate carbon chain
        length. This remains to be tested, but we conjecture that this is unlikely to be the case.
        On the other hand, are odor mixtures simply perceived as a compound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> with distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> (like a triad in vertebrate pitch perception), or are mixtures unique entities
        that are perceived as fundamentally different from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwhite‚Äù</ENAMEX> in color
        perception)? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honeybees</ENAMEX> appear to employ a combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>: they can perceive the
        components of a mixture (and generalize to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> when faced with them
        individually), but also attach unique properties to the mixture [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,35</NUMEX>]. A further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complication</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerrieri et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] found intriguing asymmetries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>'
        assessments of odor similarities: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> respond as if they find odor A more similar to
        trained odor B than they find B to trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">odor</ENAMEX> A. It will be difficult to represent these
        complex phenomena in a simple map.
        These phenomena indicate that odor perception cannot be as easily visualized in a
        low-dimensionality space as other sensory modalities. However, for psychophysicists, just
        as for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> navigating novel territory, even a rough guidance map is better than no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">map</ENAMEX>, and so this olfactory space is undoubtedly a useful tool to predict the bee-subjective
        similarity of scents. While the antennal lobe clearly structures the sensory input so as to
        extract derived chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>, the information about the input from individual
        receptor types might not be discounted in the periphery of the nervous system, as in visual
        perception, but relayed on to higher processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushroom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">protocerebrum</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36,37</NUMEX>]. If both modulated and unmodulated sensory information is
        available to the neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> that ultimately ‚Äúdecide‚Äù on odor similarity, and
        especially if different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> attend differently to different kinds of input‚Äîe.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>,
        because experience modifies interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glomeruli</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]‚Äîthen the derivation of a
        static perception space that can be applied to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> may be quite
        challenging.
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Philosophers</ENAMEX> have correctly pointed out that we cannot actually imagine what it is like
        to perceive the world through other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>' sense organs [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. But studies such as those
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guerrieri et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] show elegantly how to attach scales and numbers to the inner worlds
        proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Uexk√</ENAMEX>ºll <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century ago</TIMEX>. Mapping these worlds quantitatively will allow us to
        compare them between related species operating in different environments, to see how the
        architecture of perceptual spaces is adapted to mirror biologically useful information from
        the real world in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most exciting future directions is to
        explore the extent to which such perceptual worlds are not just species-specific, but in
        fact individual-specific. In the honeybee, learning alters the response patterns of the
        glomerular map [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. If the antennal lobe has a dual function in creating the primary
        dimensions of olfactory perception and storing olfactory memories, then one prediction is
        that individual experience will alter perception. Similar phenomena have been predicted in
        other sensory modalities [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,41</NUMEX>], but remain to be shown directly by exposing different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to different environments during development.
