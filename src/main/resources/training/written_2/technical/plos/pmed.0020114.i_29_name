        Around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of these deaths occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, mostly in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the greatest
        challenges facing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> in the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>; resistance to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloroquine</ENAMEX> (CQ), the cheapest and most widely used antimalarial, is common throughout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>, and resistance to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-developed and least
        expensive alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX>, is also increasing in eastern and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. These
        trends have forced many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to change their treatment policies and use more expensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> combinations that will hopefully slow the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
        One avenue of research is to identify combinations that minimize gametocyte emergence in
        treated cases and prevent selective transmission of parasites resistant to any of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">partner drugs</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PLoS Medicine Colin Sutherland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> leading
        combination therapies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uncomplicated malaria</ENAMEX>. One regimen was an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">artemisinin</ENAMEX>-based combination consisting of artemether and lumefantrine (co-artemether,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> names <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CoArtem</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riamet</ENAMEX>). The other was a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPâ</ENAMEX>€”currently under
        consideration in several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, largely due to its low cost. In this
        randomized, controlled trial, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">497</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with acute uncomplicated falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> were
        given either a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> doses of co-artemether (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ/SP</ENAMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">406</NUMEX> received co-artemether), and their blood was tested for infectivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX> after treatment. During follow up at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> found that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> treated with co-artemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes in
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPâ</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€”7</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.9%</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48.8%</NUMEX>.
        Altogether, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-dose regimen of co-artemether was highly effective at reducing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX> and duration of gametocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>. The numbers of gametocytes and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infectiousness</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 7</TIMEX> were also reduced compared to a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. Other studies have already shown the potential of co-artemether
        combination therapy to both cure <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and reduce gametocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>, acknowledged the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. However, this study is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to demonstrate the treatment's potential to
        markedly reduce the infectiousness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, and has done so in a
        sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> setting with highly seasonal transmission and where asymptomatic
        infections are common.
        Do the results mean co-artemether should be introduced as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line treatment for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are hesitant and suggest there might be compliance issues
        with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-dose regimen. The requirement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oily food</ENAMEX> for adequate absorption might also
        lead to inadequate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> levels in the blood of many treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest that co-artemether as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line treatment is not likely to reduce
        overall transmission of 
        Plasmodium falciparum within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> but rather would
        reduce selective transmission of resistant parasites in treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Hence,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co-artemether</ENAMEX> could have a public health benefit by reducing the impact of drug
        resistance.
