        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twins</ENAMEX> have long provided a unique opportunity to study how health is shaped from
        conception to death by biological and social factors [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú5</NUMEX>]. At issue are
        the contributions, singly and combined, of genetic inheritance, in utero postzygotic events
        before and after twinning, and familial plus societal contexts, including the ways in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX> are treated by family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, each other, and society at large
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú7</NUMEX>].
        To explore these issues, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major trend in twin research has focused on comparing
        health status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> raised separately since birth or early childhood
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú7</NUMEX>]. Far fewer studies have investigated how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> raised together,
        but who differ in their postadolescent socioeconomic position, compare on adult health
        status [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4</NUMEX>]. Yet such research could potentially inform current debates over the
        contribution of lifecourse socioeconomic conditions to adult health
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú11</NUMEX>], given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>' shared genetic inheritance and early life
        socioeconomic plus biological exposures. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Twins</ENAMEX> afford an important opportunity to examine
        the additional impact of adult experiences on adult health in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> matched on early
        life experiences.
        In particular, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important unresolved issue in the burgeoning literature on lifecourse
        analysis of health concerns how well early life social circumstances are measured, since
        this these data are essential for distinguishing between the influence of early life and
        adult conditions on adult health status [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9</NUMEX>]. At issue are the often limited data on
        childhood socioeconomic conditions [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9</NUMEX>], plus the possibility of systematic error, by
        adult socioeconomic position, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> recollect their early childhood circumstances
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú14</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited</ENAMEX> data, recall bias, and poor measurement together hinder
        obtaining accurate effect estimates, due to confounding by unmeasured factors. This concern
        is especially salient for studies investigating the social patterning of health, precisely
        because living and working conditions influence health through myriad discrete yet
        entangled pathways [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,15</NUMEX>].
        Further complicating analysis of the impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic
        position on health are choices regarding the socioeconomic measure(s) employed
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú18</NUMEX>]. As discussed in several comprehensive review articles
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú18</NUMEX>], considerable evidence exists demonstrating that different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">socioeconomic measures√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùe.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>, education, occupation, income, wealth,
        housing tenure, etc.√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùare not simply
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√¢‚Ç¨≈ìexchangeable√¢‚Ç¨</ENAMEX> with each other and instead often yield
        different estimates of the magnitude of the socioeconomic gradient and affect health by
        independent as well as correlated pathways. For example, while education has often been
        valued as a socioeconomic measure precisely because, once achieved, it is not subject to
        reverse causation (e.g., poorer health leading to lower income), it also has been shown to
        be insensitive to subsequent changes in adult socioeconomic position (e.g., income
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>) that also can affect adult health status [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú22</NUMEX>]. An important
        implication is that studies concerned with the joint impact of childhood and adult
        socioeconomic position on health must take into account how their choice of socioeconomic
        measures may influence their results.
        Of note, studies of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, and especially monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, can usefully address
        problems of capturing early life circumstances and assessing the contribution of childhood
        and adult conditions on adult health. This is because monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> raised together
        through childhood (a) are tightly matched on both genetic endowment and the socioeconomic
        circumstances characterizing their gestation and early life and childhood household
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú6</NUMEX>], and (b) are the same biological sex, so they are likely
        to be accorded the same gender expectations and not have differential treatment or access
        to household resources because of their gender [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,15</NUMEX>]. Thus, even without any measurement
        of childhood conditions, a comparison of adult monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> who are concordant versus
        those who are discordant on adult socioeconomic position allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ascertainment</ENAMEX> of the extent
        to which socioeconomic position after childhood affects adult health, above and beyond the
        impact of childhood socioeconomic position. Twin analyses employing diverse socioeconomic
        measures capturing circumstances earlier versus later in adult life could also potentially
        yield insight into the impact of cumulative socioeconomic position on health, with
        interpretation of results for monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, including patterns of within-pair
        variability, aided by comparison to results to same-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dizygotic twins</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, our objective, framed by ecosocial theory and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with the lifelong
        embodiment of social conditions [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,23</NUMEX>], was to compare health status among a cohort of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monozygotic</ENAMEX> and dizygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women twins</ENAMEX> with shared upbringing (at least until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">concordant</ENAMEX> versus discordant adult socioeconomic position. Outcomes included biological
        markers, anthropometric and health outcomes, and health behaviors. We employed data on both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult occupational class</ENAMEX> and educational level, hypothesizing that the former might capture
        relevant aspects of socioeconomic position occurring after completion of educational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attainment</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>
          The study twin pairs were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Examination II</ENAMEX>, conducted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1989√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1990</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination</ENAMEX> I cohort included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">434</NUMEX> twin pairs recruited in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1978√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1979</NUMEX> from a twin registry established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> resided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX> at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and were born in or prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> (mean
          age, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41 y</NUMEX>; range, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">18√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú85 y</ENAMEX>). Zygosity for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was determined by
          analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> polymorphic loci, such that the probability of misclassification as
          monozygous was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.001</NUMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1989√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú1990</ENAMEX>), original cohort <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were sent a
          self-administered questionnaire on their health and sociodemographic characteristics plus
          an invitation to return for a physical exam [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Cohort retention was high: Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3%</NUMEX>) did not respond, of whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> were deceased. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">796</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, only
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.9%</NUMEX>) did not return for a physical exam. After additionally excluding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> women
          whose twin was a nonrespondent, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> cohort included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">352</NUMEX> twin pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monozygotic</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> dizygotic), representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81.1%</NUMEX> of the original cohort. Enrollment and
          study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiser Permanente Medical Care</ENAMEX>
          Program, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern California Region</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>; analyses for this
          investigation were additionally approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard School of Public Health Human</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subjects Committee</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socioeconomic Data</ENAMEX>
          Childhood and adult socioeconomic position were measured at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> using a
          self-administered questionnaire. We employed a modified version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erik Olin Wright</ENAMEX>'s
          occupational <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class schema</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,16,25√¢‚Ç¨‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äú27</ENAMEX>], analogous to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>'s newly established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification</ENAMEX> system
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NS-SEC</ENAMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Distinctions</ENAMEX>, in order of dominance, were between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> classified as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√¢‚Ç¨≈ìnonworking class√¢‚Ç¨</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWC</ENAMEX>; own a business and employ others,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-employed</ENAMEX>, or supervisory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>), √¢‚Ç¨≈ìworking class√¢‚Ç¨
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WC</ENAMEX>; nonsupervisory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>), or not in the paid labor force
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,16,25√¢‚Ç¨‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äú27</ENAMEX>].
          We defined √¢‚Ç¨≈ìchildhood household social class√¢‚Ç¨ as the
          occupational class position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> identified as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-of-household when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respondent</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX>; we also ascertained the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> who lived together
          until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least age 14</TIMEX>. We measured adult household social class using a validated,
          gender-appropriate approach, equal to the most dominant class position, taking into
          account the usual individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> position of the respondent and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> or other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head-</ENAMEX>of-household, if any [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,25,26</NUMEX>]. Using a gender-neutral approach to measuring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household class</ENAMEX> is increasingly recognized as a more valid means of assessing household
          socioeconomic position than one which automatically assigns it to either (a) the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respondent</ENAMEX>, whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, or (b) the occupation of the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the
          household (if one is present), given the rise of dual wage-earner households
          [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú18,27√¢‚Ç¨‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äú32</ENAMEX>]. For example, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK NS-SEC</ENAMEX>
          measure explicitly rejects the prior conventional practice of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmales
          taking precedence over females√¢‚Ç¨ when selecting the
          √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhousehold reference person√¢‚Ç¨ for assignment of household
          class, and instead chooses based upon √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> responsible for
          owning or renting or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation,√¢‚Ç¨
          regardless of gender [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. We also obtained data on the educational level attained by
          each twin and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. No data were available, however, on childhood or adult
          household income, wealth, or debt, or on the educational level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>.
          Because the twin pairs were matched, by definition, on socioeconomic position in utero
          through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX>, we categorized twin pairs in relation to adult socioeconomic position.
          For adult household social class, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of pairs were possible: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> concordant
          (both WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WC</ENAMEX> or NWC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWC</ENAMEX>) and one discordant (WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWC</ENAMEX>). For education, the pairs were
          defined in relation to being concordant or discordant for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 4</NUMEX> y versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> y or
          more of college.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Outcome Data</ENAMEX>
          The selected health outcomes were chosen because of their well-documented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
          with socioeconomic position and because risk could plausibly be affected by both early
          life and adult circumstances [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9,25</NUMEX>]. Self-report data were analyzed for self-rated
          health (dichotomized as excellent/good versus fair/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> use. A validated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interviewer</ENAMEX>-administered questionnaire was used to obtain data on physical activity (kcal
          per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> per y); this instrument assessed the typical amount of time spent in activities of
          varying intensity at home, at work, and during recreation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on anthropometric and biological characteristics were obtained by physical
          examination and laboratory analysis [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Height was recorded to the nearest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> cm,
          weight was measured to the nearest <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 kg</NUMEX>, and these data were used to calculate body
          mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>/m
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>' minimum waist girth was measured using a steel tape
          at the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">indentation</ENAMEX> or at a level midway between the iliac crests and the lower
          edge of the rib <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> if no natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">indentation</ENAMEX> was present; hip girth was measured at the
          level of the greatest protrusion of the buttocks. These measurements were recorded to the
          nearest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> cm, and the averages of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures (different by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 1</NUMEX> cm) were
          used to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). After <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> rested for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> sphygmomanometer was used to take two measures each of systolic and diastolic
          blood pressure (seated, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>); averages of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures were used for data
          analysis. High blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> or higher,
          or diastolic blood pressure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> or higher, or taking antihypertensive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>.
          Blood for lipid and lipoprotein measurement was obtained after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had fasted
          overnight. It was collected into tubes containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid</ENAMEX> (EDTA).
          Total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (LDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> were
          measured by standard methods [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Glucose level (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/dl</ENAMEX> [amount √É‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äî 0.0555</NUMEX> =
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mmol/l</ENAMEX>]; measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h post-load) was determined using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> oxidase method [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>];
          analyses using data on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels excluded the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> twin pairs for whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX> had values <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 mg/dl</ENAMEX> or higher.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
          First, to establish the analytic cohort, we identified twin pairs for whom we could
          determine both that they had lived together until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least age 14</TIMEX> and their joint
          socioeconomic trajectory (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">308</NUMEX> pairs). This analytic cohort excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> twin pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> missing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on duration lived together; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reporting separation prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> where one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">twin</ENAMEX> said below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14 and the other age 14</TIMEX> or above; plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> pairs for whom the joint
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household class</ENAMEX> was either missing, inconsistent, or not in the labor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we ascertained the retained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>' sociodemographic and health
          characteristics. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, for continuous outcomes, we calculated (a) the mean matched
          difference for twin pairs discordant on adult socioeconomic position, setting the twin
          with the most socioeconomic resources as the baseline, so as to determine both the
          magnitude and direction of differences in the outcomes among these pairs, and (b) the
          mean matched absolute difference for twin pairs in each socioeconomic stratum, to
          ascertain the variability of outcomes among the twin pairs both discordant and concordant
          on adult socioeconomic position. Additionally, for the categorical outcomes, we
          calculated the kappa statistic and associated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. We do not report data on the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> WC:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WC</ENAMEX> twin pairs, because small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> rendered the parameter estimates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uninterpretable</ENAMEX>. All analyses were done in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Results
        As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tables 1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the sociodemographic and health characteristics of the full
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">352</NUMEX> pairs) and the analytic cohort (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">308</NUMEX> pairs) were quite similar, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40%</NUMEX> having grown up in
        working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class households</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had less than a 4-y
        college education. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Examination</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> of the twin pairs in the analytic cohort were
        discordant for adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household occupational class</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> were discordant for individual
        college attainment.
        Results pertain to both the direction and magnitude of the difference in health status
        among the twin pairs, in relation to both different measures of adult socioeconomic
        position and zygosity. First, regarding the magnitude of health disparities among
        monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> discordant on adult socioeconomic position, for the analyses using data
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult occupational class</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), the WC twin had significantly higher systolic
        blood pressure (mean matched difference = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.54</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.10√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú8.97</TIMEX>), diastolic blood pressure (mean matched difference = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.80</NUMEX> mm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.44√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú7.17</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> than her NWC twin (mean
        matched difference = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.82</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl [amount √É‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äî 0.0259</NUMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/l]; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.07√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú14.57</TIMEX>). Additionally, among the monozygotic twin pairs, a greater
        proportion of twin pairs discordant on occupational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> were discordant for self-reported
        health compared to twin pairs concordant on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occupational class</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.5%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.9%</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0178</NUMEX>). Poorer health was also more likely to be reported by the
        working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> twin; among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 monozygotic</NUMEX> pairs discordant on class, the proportion of
        pairs in which the WC twin reported fair or poor health while her NWC twin reported
        excellent or good health (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.6%</NUMEX>) was almost twice that of the converse (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.3%</NUMEX>, i.e., pairs
        in which the WC twin reported good or excellent health and the NWC twin reported fair or
        poor health).
        By contrast, corresponding analyses using data on educational level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 5</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
        revealed little difference in patterns of health among monozygotic twin pairs discordant on
        educational attainment. Dizgyotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> discordant on adult socioeconomic position, whether
        categorized by occupational class or educational level, likewise did not notably differ on
        their adult health status (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 3√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú6</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, regarding the variability in health outcomes among twin pairs in relation to
        their adult socioeconomic position, the mean matched absolute difference was similar among
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monozygotic twins</ENAMEX> who were discordant and concordant on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occupational class</ENAMEX>, and also
        was similar among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dizygotic twins</ENAMEX> discordant and concordant on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occupational class</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tables 3</ENAMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Within occupational class strata, however, for all the continuous outcomes other
        than diastolic blood pressure, the magnitude of variability typically was greater for the
        dizygotic than the monozygotic twin pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Similar results were obtained
        for analyses based on educational level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 5</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), with some important exceptions.
        Specifically, for several outcomes among the monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, especially average systolic
        and diastolic blood pressure, post-load <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, and physical exercise, variability was
        greatest among twin pairs in which both had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 4 y</NUMEX> of college, intermediate among
        discordant pairs, and least among those where both had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 y</NUMEX> of college or more.
      
      
        Discussion
        Our study provides novel evidence suggesting that correlations in health outcomes among
        adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> twin pairs who lived together through childhood vary by their subsequent
        socioeconomic position, with results sensitive to choice of socioeconomic measure. Although
        small numbers limit precision of estimates, cardiovascular factors differed more among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> who were discordant on adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation class</ENAMEX> than twin pairs concordant on being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, and, within twin pairs discordant on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occupational class</ENAMEX>, the working-class
        twin typically fared worse than the professional twin. These patterns were much weaker or
        not evident for analyses using data on educational attainment. Together, these results,
        combined with our prior research showing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> who experienced cumulative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX> had the worst health [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], lend additional support to the hypothesis that
        cumulative experiences across the lifecourse, including those after adolescence and after
        completion of educational attainment, and not just early life experiences, shape adult
        health [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9</NUMEX>].
        Additionally, the greater magnitude of variability in outcomes among dizygotic compared
        to monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> within the same socioeconomic strata is what would be expected, given
        the tighter matching on genetic endowment among the monozygotic twins
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú5</NUMEX>]. However, the suggestive finding of greater magnitude of
        variability, within both the monozygotic and dizygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, among pairs with the least
        education compared to the most education, especially for the cardiovascular-related
        results, has not to our knowledge previously been reported. Given that low educational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attainment</ENAMEX> is highly correlated with low socioeconomic resources during childhood
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú18</NUMEX>], our results lend tentative support to the hypothesis that
        increased variability of physiological traits such as blood pressure may be positively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with greater early-life and cumulative exposure to economic deprivation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. A
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of research suggests that chronic exposure to social stressors associated with
        socioeconomic deprivation may result in repeated activation√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùand
        ultimately harmful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dysregulation√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùof</ENAMEX> physiological systems that respond
        to stress, thereby increasing risk of elevated blood pressure, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance, and
        visceral fat deposition and thus risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX>, obesity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú39</NUMEX>].
        Study limitations include (a) the relatively small number of twin pairs (albeit similar
        to other twin studies [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,11</NUMEX>]); (b) lack of data on detailed occupational class position
        over time and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at obtaining a college degree, plus prior or current data on income,
        poverty, wealth, and debt; (c) lack of data on gestational age, birth weight, birth order,
        and whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> had shared or separate chorions and amniotic sacs [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,7,11,40</NUMEX>]; (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>)
        lack of data on differences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>' childhood experiences and exposures (e.g.,
        differential treatment accorded to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>- versus <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, and to monozygotic
        versus dizygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]); and (e) lack of data on male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>; in addition, the small
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women twins</ENAMEX> who were concordant on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> working class position limits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalizability</ENAMEX> (but not internal validity) of results. Most studies assessing the impact
        of childhood socioeconomic position on health, however, have relied on occupational and
        sometimes educational data [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9,26,41√¢‚Ç¨‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äú46</ENAMEX>], reflecting difficulties in
        obtaining income data across the lifecourse [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú18</NUMEX>].
        By contrast, strengths of our study include: (a) biological confirmation of zygosity;
        (b) identical gestational age; (c) identical biological sex, relevant to gender
        expectations and gendered exposures (more similar for same- versus opposite-sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,6</NUMEX>]); (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) data on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> until which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> lived together; (e) use of a validated and
        gender-appropriate household occupational class measure, plus data on education; and (f)
        measurement of anthropometric and physiologic characteristics, not just self-reported
        health. Moreover, by focusing on postadolescence divergence of socioeconomic position, the
        study avoided concerns affecting comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> raised separately versus together,
        e.g., difficulties in assessing similarities versus differences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of origin
        versus adoptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú6</NUMEX>]. A recent analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>'
        earnings in relation to educational level additionally underscores the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of using
        twin analyses to gauge the impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic conditions, at the
        individual and the household level, on adult economic and health-related outcomes (e.g.,
        smoking) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>].
        Overall, results of this study are in accord with other research suggesting that
        cumulative exposures related to socioeconomic position, not only genetic inheritance and
        early life experiences, shape adult health
        [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú11,26,41√</NUMEX>¢‚Ç¨‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äú46,48</NUMEX>]. As with our findings, these
        studies typically have documented the strongest joint impacts for outcomes pertaining to
        cardiovascular health [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú11,26,41√</NUMEX>¢‚Ç¨‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äú46,48</NUMEX>]. Unlike
        prior research, however, the present study newly employed a same-gender twin design,
        affording comparatively tight matching on life circumstances through early adolescence,
        with monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> additionally matched on genetic inheritance, thereby circumventing
        important concerns raised about likely unmeasured <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">confounders</ENAMEX> affecting results of prior
        studies dependent upon adult recall of√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùand limited data
        on√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùchildhood socioeconomic position. Even so, generalizability of
        results to nontwins could be hampered if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> differ systematically from nontwins on
        factors influencing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between socioeconomic position and adult health, as
        perhaps related to maternal and zygotic characteristics relevant to risk of monozygotic or
        dizygotic twinning or to exposures contingent upon being a twin in utero (e.g.,
        down-regulation of growth) [<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,4√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú7,49√¢‚Ç¨‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äú52</ENAMEX>].
        In summary, creative use of social and biological twin data concerning both social and
        biological aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">twinship</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú3,6</NUMEX>] has the potential to inform
        current debates about the impact of lifecourse socioeconomic position on health. Suggesting
        such investigations could have public health import, prior research has estimated that a
        reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> in the average diastolic blood pressure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùi.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the difference we observed in the comparison of
        working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> to nonworking class monozygotic twins√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwould translate to a
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> decrease in hypertension, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> reduction in coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> reduction
        in risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and transient ischemic attacks [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. Given the longstanding fascination
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú3,6</NUMEX>], if additional and larger twin studies of
        economically diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men twins</ENAMEX> confirmed the relevance of cumulative and
        intergenerational lifetime socioeconomic resources for health, and were also able to
        include a wider array of socioeconomic measures (e.g., income, wealth, debt, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>) and data on gestational age and birth weight, the evidence would likely have
        high policy salience, plus importantly enhance understanding of how embodiment of societal
        conditions shapes population patterns of health, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and well-being [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,23,54</NUMEX>].
