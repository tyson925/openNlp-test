        ‚Äúestablished treatment‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúproven therapy,‚Äù we urge caution in using such a litmus test to
        decide whether the use of placebo is or is not acceptable. Such terms beg to be defined
        carefully. Should nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs be considered ‚Äúproven‚Äù for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arthritis</ENAMEX>, despite their problems with assay sensitivity [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>]? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> states that
        there is no established treatment for adenomatous polyps. However, there is evidence from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies and clinical trials supporting the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> and other
        nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for this condition [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4‚Äì10</NUMEX>]. Armed with such
        evidence‚Äîwhether it qualifies <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúproven therapy‚Äù</ENAMEX> is open to subjective
        interpretation‚Äîmany placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>, we maintain, would argue for an active-controlled
        design as a more ethical alternative to the placebo-controlled design actually used in
        APPROVe [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> focuses on the question of defending the use of placebo in the APPROVe study.
        This focus reflects the prevailing bias, which is to choose when it is acceptable to use
        placebo rather than to choose when it is acceptable to omit placebo. This bias is evident
        in the current version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Helsinki</ENAMEX>, with wording such as, ‚ÄúExtreme care
        must be taken in making use of placebo-controlled trials.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Thus</ENAMEX>, the use of placebo is
        typically presumed ‚Äúguilty until proven innocent,‚Äù while active-controlled designs are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presumed ‚Äúinnocent</ENAMEX> until proven guilty.‚Äù The declaration is silent on the possibility that
        omitting placebo can lead to problems, too, as we have now witnessed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vioxx</ENAMEX>.
        So perhaps the more important question should be whether it was defensible to exclude
        placebo in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIGOR</ENAMEX> study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> acknowledges that placebo would have provided a
        better assessment of the safety signal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIGOR</ENAMEX> study. Indeed, because placebo was not
        used, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> were able to plausibly conclude that the difference between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> was due to naproxen causing benefit rather than to Vioxx causing harm [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. (The
        plausibility of this conclusion has since been questioned [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,14</NUMEX>].) This misleading safety
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> only delayed the withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vioxx</ENAMEX>. Its design was superficially ethical, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> was not advanced, and the public health was ill-served.
        One might protest that these comments are made with the benefit of hindsight. It is true
        that the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> at large did not become aware of this safety issue until
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2004</TIMEX>, when the results of the placebo-controlled APPROVe study were made public
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vioxx</ENAMEX> was withdrawn. However, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Graham</ENAMEX>'s testimony to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States Senate</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] and a report on internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> documents [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], there was good reason for
        concern about a possible safety signal before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vioxx</ENAMEX> was approved and recruitment
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIGOR</ENAMEX> began [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIGOR</ENAMEX> study had included a placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, the truth about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vioxx</ENAMEX> could have been
        learned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2001</TIMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2004</TIMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. That is over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">180 weeks</TIMEX> during
        which the now infamous ‚Äútwo to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jetliners‚Äù</ENAMEX> were allowed to continue ‚Äúdropping
        from the sky every week‚Äù [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Using the midpoints of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>'s range estimates, this works
        out to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94,500</NUMEX> excess <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33,000</NUMEX> deaths, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        alone.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIGOR</ENAMEX> study said, ‚ÄúWe could not include a placebo group‚Äù [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Was
        the idea of including a placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> suggested but rejected as ‚Äúunethical,‚Äù even though
        rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> could have been used? Or did they take the path of least resistance in
        the interest of rapid institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> approval and ease of patient recruiting?
        Whatever the reason, the decision to omit placebo led to ambiguity and inaction.
        In clinical trials, whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks at efficacy (please see our opening argument in
        this debate [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]) or safety, omitting placebo often muddies the scientific waters and
        places the public health at increased risk. Good science and good ethics cannot be divorced
        from one another. We believe these considerations should factor into discussions on the
        ethics of clinical trial design. Before we experience another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vioxx</ENAMEX>, we hope that a future
        version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Helsinki</ENAMEX> will add, ‚ÄúExtreme care must be taken when omitting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">placebo</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
