        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> equipped with little more than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fortitude</ENAMEX> struggled against a landscape seemingly
        designed to thwart their intentions. A menacing sea ice figures prominently in these
        improbable survival stories. Daunting to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early-20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">explorersâ€”trapping</ENAMEX> (and
        ultimately crushing) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Shackleton</ENAMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endurance</ENAMEX> and derailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Scott</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX> 
        Discovery expeditionâ€”the seasonal pack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is the lifeblood of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antarctica</ENAMEX>'s marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecosystem</ENAMEX>.
        But as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> temperatures continue to climb in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX>, the once-forbidding
        winter sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is starting to deteriorate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> pack is forming later and retreating
        earlierâ€”and it's having a serious impact on the abundance of krill, the backbone of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX> food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
        â€œSea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is the engine that drives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antarctic</ENAMEX> ecosystems,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Fraser</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal investigator</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palmer Long Term Ecological Research</ENAMEX> program (LTER) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polar Oceans Research Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>. â€œMany of the key <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that govern
        ecosystem dynamics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX> have life histories that depend on the availability of
        winter sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. The most important species in most sectors of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> is krill.â€
        A major food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Antarctic fish</ENAMEX>, penguins, pelagic seabirds, seals, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">krill</ENAMEX> (
        Euphausia superba ) look like shrimp, but weigh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just a gram</NUMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and measure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six centimeters</NUMEX> long (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œwhale food</ENAMEX>,â€ krill
        aggregate in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-swarms</ENAMEX> that can reach a density of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30,000 individuals per square meter</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">attracting whales</ENAMEX>, which can eat <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three tons</NUMEX> of krill in a single feeding, and fisheries,
        which net on average <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000 metric tons</NUMEX> per year.
        The waters off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctic Peninsula</ENAMEX> favor high krill concentrations. â€œOnce you get
        into extreme environments such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Ocean</ENAMEX>, diversity will decrease but the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will increase because the production can be very high,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>
        Gallager, a marine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Woods Hole</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>).
        Production is particularly high along the sea ice edge, he says, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thinner</ENAMEX>, which allows more sunlight to penetrate, and because ocean mixing processes along
        the continental shelf cause an upwelling of nutrient-rich deep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Increased nutrients
        support increased primary production along the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> edge. â€œIf <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> forms too late,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says
        Gallager, â€œyou don't get this higher production, which impacts zooplankton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> like
        the larval krill that graze the under<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-ice</ENAMEX> surface, feeding on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice algae</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> edge is an
        absolutely critical habitat, a nursery, for larval krill.â€
        But this krill hotspot is showing some of the most dramatic changes in sea ice extent.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser</ENAMEX> says the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctic Peninsula</ENAMEX> has registered the â€œlargest increase in
        temperatures on the planetâ€â€”on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 degrees Celsiusâ€”over</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 50 years</TIMEX>. This
        warming trend, he says, has been particularly pronounced during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">winterâ€”â€œcrunch timeâ</ENAMEX>€
        for many key <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Antarctic species</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œThere</ENAMEX> was a time when almost every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> experienced very heavy sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Fraser</ENAMEX> says,
        â€œreaching out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drake Passage</ENAMEX>.â€ Where once heavy sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> would form on average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        out of every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>, he says, now it forms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just one or two years</TIMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>).
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a typical year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> starts to form in the coldest regions along the southern coast in
        late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March/early April</TIMEX> (austral fall), then works its way up the coast. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late ice years</TIMEX>
        are becoming more common, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> forming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three weeks later</TIMEX>. â€œThese patterns are
        completely different from patterns that existed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as 30 to 40 or 50 years ago</TIMEX>,â€
        says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX>. â€œThe whole system is becoming unhinged as a result of this enormous
        warming.â€
      
      
        Retreating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea Ice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krill</ENAMEX> Declines
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2004</TIMEX>, the most comprehensive study to date of krill distribution and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Ocean</ENAMEX> reported a catastrophic drop in krill numbers. Angus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkinson</ENAMEX>, a marine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Antarctic Survey</ENAMEX>, led the study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWe</ENAMEX> pulled
        together all the net samples we could lay our hands on that had been obtained in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Ocean</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 80 years</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Atkinson</ENAMEX> says, analyzing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 12,000</NUMEX> krill summer
        net hauls taken from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1926â€“1939</NUMEX> and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1976â€“2003</NUMEX>.
        â€œThe <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Ocean</ENAMEX> is an enormous area, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> of krill stocks were in this
        comparatively narrow sector between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctic Peninsula</ENAMEX>,â€ he says. His
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> found a positive correlation between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> sea ice cover and the abundance of krill
        the following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. There's evidence of a general decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> sea ice extent and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkinson</ENAMEX> says, and of a general decline in krill populationsâ€”down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> over the
        past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> yearsâ€”over the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southwest Atlantic</ENAMEX> sector.
        Though krill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> showed big fluctuations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX>, their average
        numbers were higher over a longer period, explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volker Siegel</ENAMEX>, a krill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Fisheries Research Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, who worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkinson</ENAMEX>. â€œWhere
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> you might have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 krill per square meter</NUMEX> on averageâ€”with fluctuations
        between, say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 and 300â</NUMEX>€”nowadays you might see <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 per square meter</NUMEX>, which goes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square meter</NUMEX>.â€
        Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkinson</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> can say for sure what's causing the decline, but both say
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sea ice</ENAMEX> is clearly playing some role. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Krill</ENAMEX> live <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five to six years</TIMEX>. During
        the breeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December to March</TIMEX>, embryos are released in the upper water
        column, and the larvae hatch at depths ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 meters to 1,500 meters</NUMEX>, unlike many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other invertebrate larvae, which hatch at the surface. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Larvae</ENAMEX> then have to swim up
        through the water column to reach the sea surface. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, krill larvae don't have
        enough body fat to carry them through food shortages. â€œThey'll starve if they have to rely
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>-column food distributions, and that's where the sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> comes in,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkinson</ENAMEX>.
        â€œThe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> may also shelter them from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX>, but one way or another, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> is
        good for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">krill</ENAMEX>.â€
        â€œWe've got to find out what's causing these changes and then we can start to predict
        what's going to happen with future scenarios of climate change,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Atkinson</ENAMEX> says. â€œThe other
        thing we've got to do is look at alternative things which might be affecting krill. We
        might find there are other things declining as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, such as their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, or
        there might be a change in the fertilization of the waters.â€
        Accompanying the drop in krill abundance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkinson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> found an increase in
        salps, transparent jelly-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> that typically inhabit warmer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> than krill.
        Expanding into the warmer waters, salp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are increasing in the southern part of
        their range and replacing the krill. Most krill-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX> do not eat salp.
      
      
        Krill Declines Ripple up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Chain</ENAMEX>
        At a hearing on climate change impacts before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Senate Committee on</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2004</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTER</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> testified that the western
        Antarctic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula</ENAMEX>'s cold, dry polar marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecosystem</ENAMEX> is gradually being replaced with a
        warm, moist maritime climate. While all the major components of the food web are responding
        to these changes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> said, the clearest evidence comes from studies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> especially
        sensitive indicators of climate change: krill and penguins. â€œTrends in penguin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
        provided some of the first evidence that sea ice conditions in some areas were
        deteriorating in response to climate warming,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Fraser</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX>.
        This evidence came from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX>'s own studies, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 30 years</TIMEX>, of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Antarctic
        penguin <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that share similar life histories (including a penchant for krill) but show
        striking contrasts in their relationship to the sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdÃ©lie</ENAMEX> (
        Pygoscelis adeliae ) penguins, the presence of sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is
        absolutely essential for survival. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinstrap</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. antarctica</ENAMEX> ) and gentoo (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. papua</ENAMEX> ) penguins, on the other hand, require the absence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œAdÃ©lie penguins</ENAMEX> have experienced a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 70%</NUMEX> decrease in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> at
        our study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Anvers Island [Palmer Station</ENAMEX>] in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antarctic Peninsula</ENAMEX> over
        the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX>, â€œand there's evidence that other krill-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX>
        are beginning to decrease.â€
        That's a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> breeding pairs since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>. The major factors underlying this
        precipitous decline, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> says, are retreating sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and increasing snowfall. (The loss
        of sea ice increases the flow of water vapor from the open ocean to the atmosphere,
        increasing precipitation.) â€œWhen sea ice forms,â€ he explains, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œit</ENAMEX> covers these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of
        high production and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are just able to plop into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> into very good feeding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>.â€ With a life history accustomed to the formation of sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> at critical points in
        their life cycle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdÃ</ENAMEX>©lies are finding themselves faced with an unpredictable sea ice cycle
        that outpaces their ability to adapt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œThe birds</ENAMEX> just don't have the sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> when they need
        it,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Fraser</ENAMEX> says. As if losing critical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> habitat weren't bad enough, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdÃ©lies</ENAMEX> must
        also contend with the effects of increased snowfall. When the snow melts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>,
        it's flooding their nesting areas and drowning their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and chicks.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> trends for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â€œice-avoidingâ</NUMEX>€ chinstraps and gentoos are quite different.
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are increasing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and beginning to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdÃ</ENAMEX>©lie penguins
        across a broad range in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctic Peninsula</ENAMEX>. â€œWe're seeing breeding gentoo
        penguins at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palmer Station</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Fraser</ENAMEX> says, with a trace of astonishment. â€œThe
        paleoecological record does not show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> at our study sites in the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.â€
        Though chinstraps and gentoos also depend on krill, they've dealt with krill declines by
        eating more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and squid (which, not incidentally, also eat krill). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser</ENAMEX> believes this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dietary</ENAMEX> flexibility, along with the increased availability of open water and a late
        breeding schedule (which protects their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and chicks from spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow meltwater</ENAMEX>),
        largely explain their range extensions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œAdÃ©lies</ENAMEX> don't seem capable of adjusting anything about their life history,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fraser</ENAMEX>. â€œThey're hard-wired to their breeding area, returning to an area <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> after year
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, even though conditions are deteriorating.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ And</ENAMEX> so, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">numbers</ENAMEX> continue to
        plummet as more chicks perish. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice-dependent</ENAMEX>, krill-eating penguin <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emperor</ENAMEX> (
        Aptenodytes forsteri ), is not faring any better. â€œWe have just
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">emperor colony</ENAMEX> in our study region, and it's decreasing very fast,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Fraser</ENAMEX> says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œIt</ENAMEX>'s
        gone down from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> breeding pairs to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>. They're on the verge of extinction in our study
        region.â€
      
      
        A Question of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sustainability</ENAMEX>
        A major issue in devising strategies to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">krill populations</ENAMEX> concerns the impact of
        krill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX>. Since drastic declines have occurred in the absence of heavy fishing, it's
        especially important to establish the population dynamics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX> krill. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> works
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Convention</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</ENAMEX> (CCAMLR) to
        develop sustainable fishing regulations. Based on a point estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44 million metric</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of krill in the southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAMLR</ENAMEX> calculated a potential yield
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 million tons</NUMEX>, far above the average <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100,000-metric-ton</NUMEX> catch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> believes
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> aren't posing a significant threat to krill stocks at this point, but says
        much remains to be learned about krill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> structure.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallager</ENAMEX> is not so sure about the impact of krill fishing. Some krill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> operate
        near the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Georgia</ENAMEX>, east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falkland Islands</ENAMEX>. â€œWe know that these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are not self-sustaining, but require recruiting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> from other locations,
        and probably from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> along the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">peninsula of Antarctica</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallager</ENAMEX>. â€œIf we
        go in and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that are not self-seeding, then they could be entirely
        wiped out.â€ That's why it's crucial to know which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, if any, are self-sustaining,
        he says. â€œAnd we don't know a lot about that at all.â€
        Toward that end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallager</ENAMEX> is working on an under-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice â€œzooplankton observatoryâ</ENAMEX>€ that
        would sit on the bottom of the ocean floor and continuously release a flotation
        packageâ€”â€œonce <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>, for hopefully the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> yearsâ€â€”outfitted with sonar and optical
        sensors up to the surface, then winch itself back down again. The plan is to deploy the
        observatory off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palmer Station</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2006</TIMEX>. The hope is that data gathered on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-wintering larval krill will shed light on the factors influencing krill survival over
        the long term. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œIt</ENAMEX> may be that this coupling between larval krill and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is actually
        underpinning the entire question of krill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> dynamics,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallagerâ</ENAMEX>€”in which
        case, understanding how the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> moves relative to the water currents and wind shear over
        the top will be critical.
        Many other aspects of krill biology remain obscure as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Biologists</ENAMEX> still don't
        understand the precise mechanisms required to enhance larval growth, reproduction, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX> (replenishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>), or how temperature
        fluctuations affect metabolism and larval growth rate. Robust tests of long-held theories
        of how the under<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-ice</ENAMEX> habitat sustains krill larvae require much more quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dataâ</ENAMEX>€”over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and over a wide scaleâ€”on larval abundance, distribution, and foraging behavior. But
        netting krill is not easy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Larvae</ENAMEX> tend to wedge themselves into nooks and crannies, defying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>' attempts to nab them while protecting their expensive netsâ€” loaded with even more
        expensive electronic gearâ€”from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>.
        Whatever is behind the correlation between sea ice decline and krill declines, the
        future of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecosystem</ENAMEX> hangs in the balance. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> report by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intergovernmental Panel</ENAMEX> on Climate Change predicted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctic Peninsula</ENAMEX> will
        experience some of the largest, most rapid climate changes on earth. If these trends of
        rising temperatures and decreasing sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> continue, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LTER's Fraser</ENAMEX>, â€œwhat we are going
        to see in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next ten</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 30 years</TIMEX> is a system that is completely different from the one
        that exists now. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AdÃ©lies</ENAMEX> will become regionally extinct.â€
        Concluding his testimony on climate change impacts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Senate</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> that if future warming continues and the cycle of heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> years exceeds the
        life span of krill, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will face a reproductive crisis. And that, he said, â€œwill
        have catastrophic consequences to the integrity of this marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecosystem</ENAMEX>.â€
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, for the sake of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> penguin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apsley Cherry-Garrard</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>'s ill-fated polar expedition endured what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherry-Garrard</ENAMEX> called â€œextremity
        of sufferingâ€ from which only â€œmadness or death may give relief.â€ The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> believed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> might prove that the penguins were the missing link between â€œbirds and the reptiles
        from which birds have sprung.â€
        Our understanding has advanced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">light years</TIMEX> since then, rendering such notions nearly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quaint</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cherry-Garrard</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX> thought the forbidding Antarctic landscape immune
        to human assaults. Today, with this notion, too, proven false, one wonders if the damage
        can be reversed. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkinson</ENAMEX>'s diplomatic phrase, â€œthere are political issues involvedâ€
        where global warming is concerned. But the clock is ticking. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX> ecosystem
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collapses</ENAMEX>, it won't be because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> were off on a misguided search for penguin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>.
