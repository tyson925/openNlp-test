        resistance and type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Although the link is well established in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rodent</ENAMEX> models, the mechanisms involved in obesity-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> are not clear.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> secreted by adipocytes compromise peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for such adipocyte signals have been identified.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them, resistin, was discovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell Lazar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, who
        showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse adipocytes</ENAMEX> and regulated by a group of
        anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic drugs</ENAMEX> called thiazolidinediones. Several lines of evidence from functional
        studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> suggested that resistin could be the missing mechanistic link between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        The human homolog of resistin has subsequently been under intense investigation, but
        initial studies revealed more differences than similarities between the human and rodent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resistin</ENAMEX> is mostly expressed in macrophages, not in adipocytes, and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> levels do not correlate as clearly with obesity, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        Similarly, genetic association studies between allelic variants of the resistin gene and
        metabolic abnormalities have so far been inconclusive. These results prompted some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> in the field who had jumped on the resistin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bandwagon</ENAMEX> after the initial results
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> to jump off again. Others, including the resistin discoverers, continue their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quest</ENAMEX> to uncover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistin</ENAMEX>'s role in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and have started to think outside the framework
        defined by the mouse data.
        Starting with the role of macrophages in inflammation and encouraged by the fact that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> are associated with markers of systemic inflammation, Lazar
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> examined the resistin response to inflammatory stimulators. As they report
        in this issue, resistin production in macrophages and serum levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        significantly increased by these stimulators. This response can be blocked by the
        thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone and by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that have dual anti-inflammatory
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-sensitizing actions and antagonize the immune <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regulator NF-kappaB</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> go on to show that activation of NF-kappaB is sufficient to induce resistin
        expression. And <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-kappaB</ENAMEX> is necessary for the resistin response to inflammatory
        stimuli.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> now view obesity as a state of chronic inflammation and speculate
        that in obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> inflammatory cytokines lead to elevated production of resistin by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> and elevated serum resistin levels, which in turn contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. This is consistent with some studies that have found higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resistin</ENAMEX> levels in obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>,
        but not all studies have found such differences.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Flier</ENAMEX>, an obesity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> who was not involved in the study, calls the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article ‚</ENAMEX>Äúan excellent and timely paper that demonstrates the fact that inflammatory
        pathways induce resistin expression and levels in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monocytes ex vivo</ENAMEX>, and in intact
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. The work appears to provide a novel link between inflammation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        resistance, through monocyte derived resistin.‚Äù He points out, however, that ‚Äúseveral other
        factors also appear to contribute directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance in inflammation (e.g.,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytokines</ENAMEX> themselves, without invoking resistin) so the full biologic implications of the
        high resistin levels for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> cannot be determined from this
        study.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Resistin</ENAMEX>, it seems, continues to resist easy interpretations.
