        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of state and government convened a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Special Session</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and adopted unanimously the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúDeclaration of Commitment</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/AIDS‚Äù [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In
        preparation for that session, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwartl√§nder et al.</ENAMEX> published an estimate of the resource
        needs for an expanded global response to the epidemic, which called for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around US$10</NUMEX>
        billion for the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, on the occasion of the 14th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International AIDS</ENAMEX> conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stover et al.</ENAMEX> showed that such an
        immediate and expanded response in low- and middle-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> could reverse the
        course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic and avert <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 30 million</NUMEX> infections through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Today, more resources are available for the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> than ever before, but global
        efforts to confront the epidemic continue to disappoint. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, more people
        were living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> died of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any previous year</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sub-Saharan Africa</ENAMEX>, home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dying from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> had access to
        life-saving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of 2004</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        The theme of the 15th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International AIDS Conference</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> was timely
        and relevant. ‚ÄúAccess for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All‚Äù</ENAMEX> calls for extending to all of those in need both sufficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> and a set of proven interventions to prevent new infections and save lives
        through effective treatment. Recent developments in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment, with simple combination
        therapies priced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than US$150</NUMEX> per year‚Äîunthinkable just a short time ago‚Äîwere a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">major driver</ENAMEX> of discussions during the conference. Widespread access to effective
        antiretroviral therapy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> is now conceivable even in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with severely limited resources.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint United Nations Programme</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> have defined an ambitious ‚<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Äú3 by 5‚Äù</NUMEX> target of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on ART‚Äîhalf of those
        in most urgent need‚Äîby <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2005</TIMEX>. The potential epidemiologic impact of large-scale
        roll-out of treatment programs, however, remains uncertain. Experience to date is limited,
        and comes mostly from Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>. While declines in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> mortality in the
        industrialized world have been impressive [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7,8</NUMEX>], many of these success stories have been
        accompanied by a resurgence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> incidence due to increasing risk behavior as emphasis
        shifted from prevention to treatment in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1990s</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10,11</NUMEX>]. Will the extension of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> who suffer from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> be the long-awaited breakthrough in
        the response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, or will the emphasis on treatment detract from prevention efforts, and
        thus hamper <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> control in the medium and long term? The experience in high-income
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> underscores the potential perils of failing to adapt prevention strategies to an
        environment in which life-saving treatment becomes available on a large scale; however,
        more favorable outcomes in some settings [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,13</NUMEX>] indicate that rising risk behavior is not
        an inevitable outcome of increased treatment access.
        In our previous analysis of the potential benefits of a comprehensive package of
        preventive interventions [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], we noted that these prevention effects would be achieved only
        in the presence of wide-scale treatment and political support. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intervening years
        have seen a dramatic rise in both momentum and financial resources for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> scale-up, but
        the potential epidemiologic impact of treatment in the context of a broader strategy for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> control has not yet been examined. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we quantify the opportunities
        and potential risks of large-scale treatment roll-out. The results of this analysis will be
        informative for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, independent of the level and stage of the
        epidemic. However, since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> deaths from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> occur in sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>,
        successes and failures in rolling out treatments immediately will have the most dramatic
        effects in this region. We therefore focus our analyses and discussions in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV epidemics</ENAMEX> in sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
        .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Projections of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV Epidemics</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sub-Saharan Africa</ENAMEX>
          Baseline projections of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV epidemics</ENAMEX> in sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> have been developed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint United Nations Programme</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> based on the
          most current data available, and in collaboration with epidemiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> assessed [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. These ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù forecasts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004 to 2020</TIMEX>
          are characterized by the absence of behavioral change or ART scale-up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">future years</TIMEX>.
          Combined with the natural dynamics of the epidemic, these assumptions result in a
          relatively stable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevalence rate.
          To simulate the effects of prevention and treatment on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS incidence</ENAMEX>, prevalence,
          and mortality, we first adapted the analytic approach used in the previously described
          Goals model [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] to allow explicit modeling of treatment effects, and calibrated the model
          to the baseline projections for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West/Central</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>)
          (see Protocol <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1</TIMEX> for more details). In line with the predominant epidemiologic pattern in
          sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> spreading through heterosexual contact, the model divides the
          sexually active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different interacting risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and female sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. In sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> is transmitted via other modes at comparatively low levels, and these modes were
          therefore not considered in our analyses.
          The model includes underlying regional demography, acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and other
          sexually transmitted infections (STIs), progression from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, and progression
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> to death. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> risks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection in each risk group depend on the number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX>, the number of sex acts per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV prevalence</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>
          and condom use. These risks are magnified by the presence of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] and also
          vary as a function of the time since infection, with the highest risks during acute
          infection, followed by lower levels that persist until viral loads rise with the onset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">clinical AIDS</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,16,17</NUMEX>].
          The regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were calibrated as follows: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, plausible ranges were specified
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> parameters governing sexual behavior and biological factors (e.g., transmission
          risks and cofactor effects of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX>) based on review of published studies and survey
          results; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, multiple simulations were undertaken by sampling values from each of the
          ranges and recalculating the model for each set of sampled parameter values; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, model
          fit was assessed by comparing modeled prevalence for adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> separately
          to baseline projections through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, the best-fitting parameter set in each
          regional model was selected for the purpose of scenario analysis (see Protocol <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1</TIMEX>).
        
        
          Alternative Scenarios for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> and Treatment
          Potential impacts of prevention efforts at a given coverage level were based on
          previously published estimates [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] for a comprehensive package of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> interventions that
          included mass media campaigns, voluntary counseling and testing, peer counseling for sex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>-, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>- and workplace-based programs, condom promotion and distribution,
          treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX>, and prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-to-child transmission. The comprehensive
          package described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stover</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> also included interventions such as harm
          reduction for injecting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and peer outreach for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who have sex with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, which
          we have not modeled for sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. Impacts were captured in terms of changes in
          condom use, sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX>, treatment-seeking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at first sex. The
          impacts of treatment included increased survival by a median of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 y</NUMEX>, reductions in
          transmission probabilities given contact with an infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, and behavior
          change.
          We examined a range of alternative scenarios based on various levels and effectiveness
          of prevention interventions, with and without successful attainment of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          treatment target for sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>:
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baseline (‚Äúbusiness</ENAMEX> as usual‚Äù).
            Risk behaviors are maintained at current levels, and no treatment scale-up occurs.
            This is simply the baseline scenario that produces a relatively stable prevalence rate
            over the duration of the projection, with the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> and the
            number of new infections rising slowly over time because of population growth.
          
          
            Treatment-centered response.
            In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative scenarios, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 target</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> coverage of those in need of
            treatment by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2005</TIMEX> is attained, and scale-up continues to reach <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> ART
            coverage of those in need by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, maintained at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> thereafter. In an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúoptimal ART</ENAMEX>
            effects‚Äù scenario, we assumed that treatment reduces transmissibility by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>, and that
            those under treatment have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> partnership numbers and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times higher
            condom use than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. With a response that focuses primarily on treatment, it
            is assumed that behavior in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of infected and uninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> is
            unchanged from the baseline. In an alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúmixed ART effects‚</ENAMEX>Äù scenario, less
            optimistic assumptions were made: that treatment reduces transmissibility only to the
            same levels as in asymptomatic infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> reduction from no
            treatment), and that behavior in treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is the same as in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. To
            capture the possibility of behavioral disinhibition in response to treatment
            availability, we assumed that condom use declines by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> in both treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and
            the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, with other behaviors unchanged. The potential for disinhibition
            is suggested primarily by experience in some developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, where condom use
            increased dramatically in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> at highest risk prior to the introduction of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> but then declined; the likelihood and magnitude of reductions in condom use in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sub-Saharan Africa</ENAMEX>, where such prevention-induced changes generally are much less
            prominent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, might be questioned. We therefore considered in sensitivity analyses a
            variant of this scenario that excludes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disinhibition</ENAMEX> but preserves all other
            assumptions.
          
          
            Prevention-centered response.
            In the absence of wide availability of treatment, reflecting weaker political and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> control efforts, we modeled a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">scenario</ENAMEX> in which the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> prevention package described previously [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] has only partial
            effectiveness at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> level, and no ART scale-up occurs. As evidence about
            the magnitude of treatment‚Äìprevention interactions remains limited, we considered a
            reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> from the full impact as a base case and examined a range of reductions
            from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25% to 75%</NUMEX> in sensitivity analyses.
          
          
            Combined response.
            We examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenarios combining treatment and prevention efforts, reflecting
            either optimistic or pessimistic possibilities. In the optimistic scenario, treatment
            strengthens prevention efforts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> coverage is the same as in the two
            treatment-centered scenarios, with optimal assumptions about treatment impact on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmissibility</ENAMEX> and patient behavior. It is assumed that widespread availability of
            treatment enables the full impact of prevention efforts to be attained as described by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stover et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In a more pessimistic scenario, an emphasis on treatment leads to
            less effective implementation of prevention. This scenario includes the mixed
            assumptions about ART effects (excluding disinhibition in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>), and
            assumes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 25%</NUMEX> attainment of the maximum potential impact of prevention efforts.
            Additional scenarios could include pessimistic assumptions about limited ART
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scale-up</ENAMEX> levels and timing, emergence of large-scale drug resistance resulting from low
            adherence, or other possible unintended outcomes of wider treatment. Certainly,
            large-scale treatment efforts will demand close monitoring of adverse effects. However,
            experience with treatment programs in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> has been encouraging thus
            far, with reported adherence levels that are at least as high as those in developed
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,19</NUMEX>].
          
        
      
      
        Results
        In the baseline projections for sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> number of new adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infections rises from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4 to 3.7 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2004 and 2020</TIMEX>, and adult <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> mortality
        rises from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8 to 2.6 million</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). If scale-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> reaches the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 target</TIMEX> and
        eventually expands to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> coverage, without any behavior change in the broader community
        (treatment-centered response/optimal ART effects), the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> number of new infections
        could be reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 6%</NUMEX> compared to baseline by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. Mortality would initially
        decline by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> but long-term trends would converge toward the baseline. We note that total
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> death numbers indicate broad trends in mortality but mask more subtle health gains
        in the form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> added to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' lives.
        With less optimistic assumptions (treatment-centered response/mixed ART effects), the
        number of new infections rises, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.3 million</NUMEX> per year by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> (a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> increase); mortality
        trends are similar to the optimistic scenario in the short term, but worse in the long
        term, even compared to the baseline. Excluding the assumption of reduced condom use through
        disinhibition from the treatment-centered/mixed effects scenario has minimal effect on the
        results, lowering the number of new infections in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX> compared to the scenario
        that includes disinhibition.
        A prevention-centered response would have greater impact on the number of new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, lowering annual incidence by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. The long-term mortality
        trend is more favorable in the prevention-centered scenario than in the treatment-centered
        scenario because of reduced incidence, but prevention would produce negligible mortality
        benefits in the near- and mid-term future in comparison to strategies that include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>.
        Alternative assumptions regarding overall effectiveness in a prevention-centered response
        produce results that scale as expected, with reductions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> incidence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34% to 64%</NUMEX>
        and reductions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> mortality of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20% to 42%</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>.
        If treatment and effective prevention are scaled up jointly in a combined response, the
        benefits in terms of both infections and deaths averted could be substantially higher. In
        an optimistic scenario in which treatment programs support expanded prevention, the annual
        number of new infections would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX> lower and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> mortality would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX> lower by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>, compared to baseline. It is worth noting that the long-term decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> deaths is
        driven more by prevention of new infections than by direct survivorship benefits from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ART</ENAMEX>.
        In a pessimistic scenario in which a more narrow treatment focus limits effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX>, the overall benefits are much more modest, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26% and 16%</NUMEX> reductions,
        respectively, in new infections and mortality by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> compared to the baseline.
        Prevalence rises by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> in the optimal and by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> in the mixed treatment-centered
        scenarios by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>, as longer survival for treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> offsets reductions in new
        infections through reduced transmissibility (and risk reductions among treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in
        the more optimistic scenario) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S1</NUMEX>). In scenarios that include prevention efforts,
        prevalence declines by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> in the prevention-centered scenario, by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX> in the optimistic
        combined response, and by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> in the pessimistic combined response by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>.
        The total number of infections averted through a combined response would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 million</NUMEX>
        over the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004 to 2020</TIMEX> if treatment enhances prevention, a benefit that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times
        greater than that of a strategy which focuses on treatment only, even with optimal
        assumptions, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX> greater than that of a strategy which focuses on (less effective)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX> alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). If a treatment focus limits the effectiveness of prevention, on
        the other hand, the total number of averted infections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2004 and 2020</TIMEX> would be 9
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>. Similarly, the benefits of a combined response in terms of mortality reductions
        are considerably higher under optimistic circumstances than the benefits of either
        treatment only or prevention only, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1 million</NUMEX> deaths averted (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>) through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> when
        treatment enhances prevention, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0 million</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) in the optimal-effects
        treatment only scenario, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.5 million</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX>) in the mixed-effects treatment only scenario, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.8 million</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) with prevention only. Under more pessimistic assumptions about
        treatment‚Äìprevention interactions, the combined response would avert <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.8 million</NUMEX> deaths
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> also reports total benefits of the various strategies over the shorter term,
        in which the ranking of alternatives is similar with regard to the total number of
        infections averted, but mortality reductions are attributable almost exclusively to
        treatment.
        Combining treatment with prevention efforts will reduce the resource needs for treatment
        substantially in the long term (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). In the various scenarios the numbers of people
        being treated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.2 million</NUMEX> in the treatment only (mixed effects)
        scenario, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2 million</NUMEX> in the optimistic combined response scenario.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we have examined the potential epidemiologic impact of global <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> efforts under a range of alternative scenarios reflecting varying implementation of
        strategies for prevention and treatment. Although we focus in particular on population
        health outcomes and epidemiologic trends, we recognize that there are numerous other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, economic, and individual health effects of interventions including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> that are
        beyond the scope of this analysis. We also restrict our focus in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> to sub-Saharan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>, where the overwhelming majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living with and dying from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        reside; however, our findings have broader applicability and more general implications in
        the worldwide fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, which we highlight here.
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Potential for Treatment to Enhance Prevention Must Be Exploited</ENAMEX>
          Effective prevention requires more than having sufficient funds to offer information
          and services. It also requires an environment that encourages <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to internalize
          messages about risky behavior and to adopt actual behavior change, and allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
          utilize services such as testing and counseling without fear of stigma or discrimination.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoneburner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Low-Beer</ENAMEX> have argued that the supportive social and political environment
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> with family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, which led
          to greater behavior change than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zambia</ENAMEX> where most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> received information
          from mass media only [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> have little reason to seek <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> testing when a positive
          result brings only negative consequences, whereas widespread availability of treatment
          provides a major incentive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to learn their serostatus.
          Involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the delivery of treatment‚Äîfor example, as
          treatment monitors‚Äîoffers unique entry points for effective prevention activities and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lever</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-wide behavior change. Experience with community roll-out of
          treatment programs has shown, for example, that uptake of voluntary counseling and
          testing increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">300%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> of roll-out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>, and by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> in
          Khayelitsha, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, after treatment introduction [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21,22</NUMEX>]. A study targeting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          commuter sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> found the highest levels of condom use, willingness to use
          a female condom, and willingness to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> test in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khayelitsha</ENAMEX>, a difference that
          may be attributed largely to the availability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> and comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> care [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. If
          increased uptake of voluntary counseling and testing is indicative of broader prevention
          effectiveness where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> is available, we estimate that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 50%</NUMEX> more new infections and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than twice as many</NUMEX> deaths could be avoided through a combined response compared to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX> alone. In contrast, if a narrow treatment scale-up leads to reduced
          effectiveness of prevention, short-term mortality reductions will come at the expense of
          longer-term progress in stemming the tide of the epidemic.
          During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most of the past 15 years</TIMEX>, efforts to address the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic in sub-Saharan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX> have focused on prevention. There have been successes in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, but
          overall these efforts have not achieved their goals. The advent of vastly expanding
          treatment programs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX>, if opportunities to capitalize on broadened
          political support and community mobilization can be seized, offers the potential to
          enhance prevention effectiveness and avert many new infections and deaths.
        
        
          Only <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Effective Prevention Will Make Treatment Affordable in the Long Run</ENAMEX>
          While prevention programs are unlikely to achieve full impact in the absence of
          treatment, so too is the impact of treatment programs reduced if vigorous prevention
          efforts are absent. Without effective prevention, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> requiring care and
          treatment will grow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. As more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are kept alive with ART the
          treatment burden will become enormous unless effective prevention reduces the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> becoming newly infected.
          Without effective prevention programs, we project that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> receiving
          treatment will grow to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3 million</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 9.2 million</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> alone
          to achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> coverage of those in urgent need. Meeting this need would require a
          tremendous increase in financing, human capacity and infrastructure that might not be
          attainable.
          If effective prevention programs are combined with treatment programs, the same level
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> ART coverage would be achieved by treating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2 million</NUMEX> in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. In other words, the same goal could be attained at a far lower treatment cost and
          with a much greater chance of sustainability.
        
        
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Successful Global Response Cannot Rely on Either Prevention</ENAMEX> or Treatment
          Alone
          Over the long term, it is effective prevention that will reduce the burden of illness
          due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in need of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>. The lessons learned in the
          industrialized world have to be taken on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. The availability of treatment and the
          shift in focus away from very effective prevention programs has led to increases in
          unsafe sexual behavior, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission in some settings [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10,11</NUMEX>]. There is
          no doubt that effective therapy can extend and improve the quality of life for those who
          are treated, but it also must be integrated into a comprehensive community response to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> so that it can enhance the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Long-term, sustained
          progress in the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> demands more than an exclusive focus on either
          prevention or treatment alone. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> makes treatment affordable, and treatment can
          make prevention more effective.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX> in sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> are faced with the most devastating epidemic of our
          times. We now have the unique opportunity to derive the maximum impact from available
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. The results from our analyses show how potential synergies between prevention
          and treatment could be translated into considerable health benefits at the population
          level. But synergies do not mean simply that prevention and treatment are pursued in
          parallel. When whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> become involved in the scale-up of treatment access‚Äîas
          will be necessary to achieve the ambitious treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> defined by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          campaign‚Äîcrucial opportunities can be created for increasing their involvement in
          prevention activities. Only if interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and community members
          occasioned by the provision of treatment are also used to reinforce prevention, and only
          if prevention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have an opportunity to refer those in need to care and treatment,
          will we move at last from slogans to impact.
