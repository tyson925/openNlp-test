        dilemma. Nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> had emerged as replicable information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> and primitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalysts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce 2002)</ENAMEX>, yet their functional potential was constrained by their structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneity</ENAMEX> and lack of reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. These properties rendered nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> well
        suited for storing information, but flawed for mediating the diverse chemistries required
        to sustain and improve increasingly complex biological systems. It is tempting to speculate
        that translation emerged as the solution to this dilemma. Translation, defined here as the
        conversion of an informationcarrying molecule into a corresponding encoded structure,
        enabled the expanded functional potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to be explored using powerful
        evolutionary methods that depend on the unique ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> to replicate.
        A small but growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have begun to tackle a modern version of this
        dilemma. While <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> can be manipulated using powerful molecular
        biology techniques that enable their directed evolution, the size, fragility, and
        relatively limited functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> diversity of biological macromolecules make them poorly
        suited for solving many problems in the chemical sciences. Ideally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> would like
        to apply evolution-based approaches to the discovery of functional synthetic, rather than
        biological, molecules. A solution analogous to nature's translation of mRNA into protein
        could, in principle, address this contemporary problem (Orgel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gartner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu 2001).</ENAMEX>
        If a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory system</ENAMEX> were developed that could translate amplifiable information carriers
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into arbitrary synthetic molecules, the evolution of synthetic molecules using
        iterated cycles of translation, selection, amplification, and diversification would be
        possible.
        The translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into synthetic molecules is conceptually distinct from the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> simply as a tag during the solidphase synthesis of a molecule that is part of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combinatorial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brenner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lerner 1992).</ENAMEX> The latter process uses <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to record the
        history of a series of chemical reactions by cosynthesizing a portion of a DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotide</ENAMEX> during each step of a molecule's solidphase synthesis. As a result, the
        identity of compounds that pass screening can be inferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification and
        sequencing of the DNA associated with a given bead (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Needels et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>). The resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, however, cannot redirect the synthesis of active compounds. In contrast, the
        translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into synthetic molecules uses the sequence of nucleotides in a strand of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to direct the synthesis of a nascent molecule. As a result, a complete cycle of
        translation, selection, and amplification can be applied to the discovery of synthetic
        molecules in a manner that is analogous to the processes that take place during biological
        evolution.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-templated organic synthesis (DTS) has emerged as one way to translate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences
        into a variety of complex synthetic small molecules (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gartner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gartner et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu 2004).</ENAMEX> In this approach, starting materials covalently linked to DNA
        templates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 20‚Äì50</NUMEX> nucleotides in length are combined in very dilute solutions
        with reagents that are covalently linked to complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA oligonucleotides</ENAMEX>. Upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watson-Crick</ENAMEX> base pairing, the proximity of the synthetic reactive groups elevates their
        effective molarity by several orders of magnitude, inducing a chemical reaction. Because
        reactions do not take place between reactants linked to mismatched (noncomplementary) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
        DTS generates synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> in a manner that is programmed by the sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in
        the template strand.
        In a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Harbury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> describe an elegant new approach to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">translating DNA</ENAMEX> into synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> called ‚ÄúDNA display.‚Äù Their approach uses DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> to separate mixtures of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX> into spatially distinct locations. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halpin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2004a</ENAMEX>) reports the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin-</ENAMEX>linked
        oligonucleotides that efficiently and sequence-specifically capture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> containing
        complementary subsequences. This immobilization process is efficient enough to be iterated,
        so that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences specifying multiple amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> can be routed to the appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miniature resin</ENAMEX>-filled columns during each step.
        In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halpin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2004b</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbury</ENAMEX> and coworkers detail solid-phase
        peptide synthesis performed on unprotected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> 340mers bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEAE Sepharose</ENAMEX>.
        Optimization of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and peptide coupling conditions
        enabled a variety of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> to undergo efficient peptide coupling to bound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> containing an amine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halpin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) integrates the routing and peptide synthesis
        described above into the translation of a library of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA 340mers</ENAMEX> into a corresponding library of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pentapeptides</ENAMEX>. To achieve chemical translation, the DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> was subjected to iterated cycles of routing and solidphase peptide synthesis. After
        each routing step, the appropriate amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> was coupled to each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-linked subpopulation.
        DNA routing was therefore used to achieve the splitting step of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúsplit-and-pool‚</NUMEX>Äù
        combinatorial peptide synthesis. The completed library of peptide‚ÄìDNA conjugates was then
        subjected to in vitro selection based on the ability to bind an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with known
        affinity for the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX>]enkephalin pentapeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu</ENAMEX>. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">routing</ENAMEX>, synthesis, and selection, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequencing</ENAMEX>, the remaining
        oligonucleotides predominantly encoded the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu</ENAMEX> sequence or close variants
        thereof. This result demonstrates that the DNA display method is capable of facilitating
        the discovery of functional molecules by enabling in vitro selection methods to be applied
        to molecules generated by split-and-pool combinatorial synthesis.
        The fundamental distinctions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> display approaches to chemical
        translation imply that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strategies will be applicable to different types of
        synthetic structures. Because the DNA display approach separates the DNA hybridization step
        from the chemical synthesis step, it does not require the coupling of synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagents</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oligonucleotides</ENAMEX> (beyond the starting material), and can use reaction conditions such as
        high temperatures or high pH that may not be compatible with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hybridization</ENAMEX>. These
        features suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> display may be able to access <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that cannot be created
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTS</ENAMEX>. Likewise, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTS</ENAMEX> approaches use effective molarity rather than intermolecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivity</ENAMEX> to direct organic synthesis, they enable modes of controlling reactivity (such
        as using otherwise incompatible reactions in a single solution [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Calderone et al. 2002</ENAMEX>]) and
        classes of chemical reactions (such as heterocoupling of substrates that preferentially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homocouple</ENAMEX>) that cannot be accessed using split-and-pool synthesis. In principle, these two
        approaches are complementary, and it is tantalizing to envision the use of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> display
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTS</ENAMEX> to direct different steps during a single chemical translation.
        In order for either approach to fully realize its potential of truly 
        evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of diverse synthetic molecules, rather than simply
        enriching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> that already contain at the outset the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmost fit‚Äù molecule</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        must develop sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> syntheses that generate remarkable complexity (vast
        numbers of different compounds) in a relatively modest number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-compatible synthetic
        steps. True evolution takes place when the theoretical complexity of a population exceeds
        the number of different molecules that can be created in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> translation step,
        and when diversification is required to access compounds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later generations</TIMEX> that are more
        fit than any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the starting pool.
        To my knowledge, no synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> to date contains this degree of complexity
        (indeed, the total size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Abstracts Service</ENAMEX> database of known chemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> is presently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 compounds</TIMEX>). However, because so few copies of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-linked synthetic
        molecule are required for in vitro selection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doyon et</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">al. 2003)‚Äîcompared</ENAMEX> with the
        relatively large quantities of material that are required for conventional screening
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approaches‚Äîthese</ENAMEX> chemical translation methods offer the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hope of achieving such
        synthetic complexity without requiring an impractical amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> or storage space.
        For comparison, a conventional-format synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 ¬µg</NUMEX> of each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> would represent <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 kg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, not including
        the mass of beads or plates associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, while a chemically translated
        library containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> copies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> different species represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX> ¬µg of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>.
        While significant remaining challenges face efforts to develop and apply chemical
        translation, the promise of marrying evolution and organic synthesis is an irresistible
        combination for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. The work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> described in this
        issue represents the latest approach to the very ancient problem of translating replicable
        information into functional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
