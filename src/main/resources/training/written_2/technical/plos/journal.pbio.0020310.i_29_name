        about ethics and aesthetics; the latest buzzwords are commodities and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.
        Traditionally, conservation initiatives have talked up the benefits they will bring to the
        global communityâ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">€”saving species</ENAMEX>, habitats, ecosystems, and ultimately the planet. But
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> also has its costs, and these are usually borne by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> prevented from
        exploiting the resources around them in other ways. It is unfair to expect a localised
        minority to pick up costs that ultimately benefit a dispersed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX>, argue conservation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>. There has to be more money made available by concerned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>,
        non-governmental organisations, national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, and international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, and there
        need to be better ways to spend this money if conservation is to be effective, they say.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biodiversity</ENAMEX> is a commodity that can be bought and sold. We are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and must pay.
      
      
        Costs and Benefits
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> boasts one of the world's most spectacular networks of national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and reserves
        covering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 60,000 km</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). But devoting such a vast area to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> has its drawbacks. It has been estimated that were this land developed it
        would be worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $270 million</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kenyan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. Similarly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madagascar</ENAMEX> are estimated to have reduced the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> by
        around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. Of course, protected areas do bring some benefits to neighbouring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>,
        most notably through tourism. But in many cases the rewards are not great, they are rarely
        distributed evenly among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and do not necessarily outweigh the costs.
        â€˜The costs of conservation fall disproportionately on local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, whereas the benefits
        are dispersed,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Balmford</ENAMEX>, a conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> and global <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> stand to benefit from
        conservation of tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biodiversity</ENAMEX>, but they must pay if they want to realise that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benefit</ENAMEX>, he says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX> expenditure in the developed world is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a third</NUMEX> of
        what is needed for effective protection of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of the earth's terrestrial habitats, an area
        just large enough to preserve a representative sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, habitats, and ecosystems
        in the medium to long term (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balmford et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). The developed world must make up this
        funding shortfall, argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balmford</ENAMEX>. What's more, there need to be smarter ways to spend the
        money that's available, he says.
      
      
        Conservation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distraction</ENAMEX>
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, many funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> have taken an indirect approach to conservation,
        investing in projects that encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to take up alternative practices that are
        compatible with conservation rather than investing in conservation itself. Perhaps the best
        example of this â€˜conservation by distractionâ€™ is ploughing money into community-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecotourism</ENAMEX> projects. Such initiatives aim to bring the benefits of tourism to local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
        thereby encouraging them to preserve the biodiversity they have.
        It's an attractive idea. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1990s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Agency for International</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> was investing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $2 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> conservation projects with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecotourism</ENAMEX> component. Similarly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1988 and 2003</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> funded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>
        development projects that supported protected areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> of which placed an
        emphasis on ecotourism.
        However, an absence of quantitative data and analysis has made it hard to judge whether
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> actually achieve their dual purpose of preserving biodiversity and
        simultaneously reducing rural poverty. â€˜Much of the information about community-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecotourism</ENAMEX> is anecdotal and subjective,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agnes Kiss of the Environment and Social</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Unit</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>. The real contribution of these initiatives to
        biodiversity conservation is debatable, she says. â€˜Many community-based ecotourism projects
        cited as success stories actually involve little change in existing local land- and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>-use practices, provide only modest supplement to local livelihoods, and remain
        dependent on external support for long periods, if not indefinitelyâ€™ (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kiss 2004</ENAMEX>).
        For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infierno Community Ecotourism Project</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX>
        have received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $120,000</NUMEX> from their share in a tourist lodge and wages for providing
        services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. This may have increased the income for a minority that are lodge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, but only one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult members</ENAMEX> were all employed by the lodge, could
        afford to live solely on tourism. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as a whole, the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income
        from tourism was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only $735</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $2,000</NUMEX> earned elsewhere. Most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> was still heavily dependent on other activities, and most of those activities are
        somewhat disruptive of conservation goals, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kiss</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johan du Toit of the Mammal Research Institute</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pretoria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX> is also critical of this kind of indirect approach to conservation. At the heart of
        the argument for community-based ecotourism is the idea of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜ecologically noble savageâ€™</ENAMEX>,
        he saysâ€”the notion that those living closest to nature will know what's best for it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜It</ENAMEX>'s
        a wonderful idea, but it just doesn't work. Nowhere in the history of evolution has
        sustainability ever been naturally selected for,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Toit</ENAMEX>. â€˜The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AK47</NUMEX> automatic assault
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rifle</ENAMEX> has replaced the bow and arrow.â€¦Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> in a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> that's out
        hunting will shoot what he sees when he sees it, because if he doesn't somebody else
        will.â€™
        Nowhere is this problem more evident than in the ecotourist paradise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GalÃ</ENAMEX>¡pagos
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), where a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minority</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> is coming into conflict with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> aims with increasing regularity (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). â€˜Things are going down very quickly,â€™
        says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GalÃ</ENAMEX>¡pagos guide. â€˜The iceberg is starting to tip over, and we are going to lose
        everything.â€™ If it still pays <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> to exploit the environment rather than take part in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the world's most buoyant ecotourism industries, it is clear that ecotourism alone
        cannot solve the world's conservation problems. Many think that â€˜direct paymentâ€™ could be a
        useful tool. â€˜Direct payment, very boldly speaking, is paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in rural areas not to
        bugger up their environment,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Toit</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜It</ENAMEX>'s just like if we want exclusive artworks
        to be looked after in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Louvre Gallery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Somebody's got to pay for it,â€™ he says.
        â€˜You can't expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parisians</ENAMEX> who live in that arrondissement to cover the costs.â€™
      
      
        You <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Get What You Pay forâ€”You Should Pay for What You Want to Get</ENAMEX>
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, where most of the world's biodiversity
        exists, the short-term rewards of exploiting these natural resources are significant.
        Replacing indirect conservation measures, such as community-based ecotourism, with payments
        directly into the pockets of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could turn out to be a much more effective way to
        stem this exploitation, argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Ferraro</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia State University</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ferraro and Kiss 2002</ENAMEX>). It could also bring far greater development benefits than
        indirect financial support, he says (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>). An additional spin-off is that direct payments
        force conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> to quantify and hence clarify their objectives, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>
        Hough, principal technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> on biodiversity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Development</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programme</ENAMEX>. â€˜We know what we don't want,â€™ he says, â€˜but we're not very good at saying what
        we do want.â€™
        A hypothetical model simulating how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madagascar</ENAMEX> should distribute an annual conservation
        budget of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 million</NUMEX> reveals that direct payments would have protected some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of original
        forest compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 12%</NUMEX> protected through a system of indirect incentives. What's
        more, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> would have been twice that generated through
        indirect investment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conrad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferraro 2001).</ENAMEX>
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferraro</ENAMEX>, the logic of direct payment is simple. He draws an analogy with a car
        journey from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A to B.</ENAMEX> There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> routes that will bring you to B, one circuitous and the
        other direct. If you only have a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, opting for the direct route improves
        the likelihood you will arrive at your destination. An indirect approach to conservation is
        like taking the circuitous route, he says, and the chances are that you will run out of
        fuel. But if it's that simple, why are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, non-governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organisations</ENAMEX>, private
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bodies</ENAMEX>, and international organisations not jumping at the chance to experiment with this
        approach?
      
      
        Paying in Perpetuity
        There are those that have reservations about direct payments. The distinction between
        indirect and direct interventions is artificial, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Lovejoy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinz Center</ENAMEX>, a nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> dedicated to improving the scientific and economic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for environmental policy. â€˜In some cases, direct payment is the only way
        conservation can happen,â€™ he says. â€˜In others, the indirect is important to reinforce a
        situation where there already is conservation. In yet others both are needed.â€™
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sjaak Swart</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Section of Science and Society</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groningen University</ENAMEX> in The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> argues that if conservation is to succeed, it must be rooted in the hearts and
        minds of those involved. Direct payments create a vision of nature dominated by calculable,
        monetary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, he says. This approach can only work in the short term, he argues, and
        indirect tools like debate and education are needed to involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in the long
        term. â€˜You need the commitment of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to save the biodiversity of our world,â€™
        he says.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Trott</ENAMEX> agrees. He is project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Local Ocean</ENAMEX>
        Trust, a charity-based conservation organisation operating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watamu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malindi Marine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">watamuturtles</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>), and is using direct payments to
        help reduce the slaughter of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watamu Turtle Watch Program</ENAMEX> is
        currently paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> just over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> to release the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> from their nets
        rather than kill them. Before the scheme started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, only around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> were being
        released from nets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> were making it back into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX>. Elsewhere along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kenyan</ENAMEX> coast, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> do not get these payments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>
        continue to be killed, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trott</ENAMEX>. However, the financial incentives are only part of a
        grander program of education and support to sensitise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to the conservation message,
        he says. Eventually, the plan is to stop payments altogether. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜Payment</ENAMEX> will be reduced as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and awareness is increased to the point where it's phased out,â€™ he says.
        Reducing or stopping the payment could work, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferraro</ENAMEX>, but it is more likely that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> will begin to suffer once more. â€˜If I had to wager, I'd bet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would go
        back to their old patterns eventually.â€™ This means that direct payments require an ongoing
        financial commitment, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't like this idea, he says.
      
      
        To the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>
        The idea of direct payments needs empirical testing before it can be embraced with
        confidence, admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferraro</ENAMEX>. Funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> should demand experimental and control data to
        allow the success of an intervention to be gauged. Conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> must therefore
        be trained in the skills needed to collect and evaluate these data. â€˜Without adequate data
        and controls you're only going to be left with guesses and vague anecdotes about the
        effects of a program intervention,â€™ he says. Decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> should begin to design
        controlled experiments from which they can make inferences about the effectiveness of these
        different interventions, he suggests.
        There are other drawbacks of direct payments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is that they might just shift
        the pressure from one site to another that was not previously being exploited. Furthermore,
        in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, land tenure is often ambiguous, which can make investment an
        unattractive prospect for funding agenciesâ€”they want to be sure they know where their money
        is going. But, notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferraro</ENAMEX>, such objections also apply to indirect interventions. â€˜I
        don't necessarily believe that conservation payments will be successful,â€™ he says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜It</ENAMEX>'s
        more I believe that of all the ideas out there for protecting biodiversity, this is the
        least bad.â€™
        All this talk of cost, benefit, and efficiency is creeping into conservation speak. For
        some, these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> and calculating terms are an odd way to describe the world's wonderfully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">unpredictable wildlife</ENAMEX>. But, increasingly, there are calls for conservation biology to cast
        aside its sentimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX>: biodiversity is a commodity that can be bought and sold;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> is business.
