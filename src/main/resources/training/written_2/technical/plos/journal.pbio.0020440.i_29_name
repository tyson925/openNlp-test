        and has evolved a dizzying variety of solutions to the problem of carrying on living. Yet
        look inside a cell and life takes on, if not simplicity, then at least a certain
        uniformity‚Äîa genetic system based around nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, for example, and a common set of
        chemical reactions for turning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>. And looked at in broad swathes, life shows
        striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalities</ENAMEX> and patterns. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mammal</ENAMEX>'s heart will beat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one billion</NUMEX> times
        in its lifetime. Both within and between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, the density of a population declines in a
        regular way as the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> increases. And the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in all
        environments declines as you move from the equator towards the poles.
        Wouldn't it be good if there were a simple theory that used life's shared fundamentals
        to explain its large-scale regularities, via its diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>? In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of ecologists and physicists have come up with just such a theory. At its
        heart is metabolism: the way life uses energy is, they claim, a unifying principle for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecology</ENAMEX> in the same way that genetics underpins evolutionary biology. They believe that
        energy use, in the form of metabolic rate, can be understood from the first principles of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physics</ENAMEX>, and that metabolic rate can explain growth, development, population dynamics,
        molecular evolution, the flux of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> through the environment, and patterns of species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diversity‚Äîto</ENAMEX> name a few.
        The work, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">originators</ENAMEX> insist, is not a theory of everything for biology, or even
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecology</ENAMEX>. But it can often seem that way. ‚ÄúWe're making advances on a broad range of
        questions almost on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> basis,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gillooly</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Mexico</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúWe've been having an awful lot of fun.‚Äù
      
      
        Beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surface</ENAMEX>
        Metabolic ecology, as it has become known, is still controversial. Some think its
        mathematical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> are unsound, and that it explains nonexistent trends. It also
        divides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> on philosophical lines‚Äîthose that see life's patterns as fundamental
        versus those who think that variation is the key, those who think that simple, general
        ideas can help us understand nature versus those who think that complicated problems
        require complicated answers. A lot is riding on the debate: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIf the theory is right, it's
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most significant in biology for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Robinson</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Aberdeen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX> would provide a common functional basis for all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biodiversity</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> have known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly two centuries</TIMEX> that larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have relatively
        slower metabolisms than small ones. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> must eat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> its body weight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
        not to starve; a human gets by on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX>. The first theories to explain this trend,
        developed in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nutritionist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Rubner</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physiologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Richet</ENAMEX>, were based on the ratio between an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s surface
        area, which changes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of its length, and its volume, which is proportional to
        its length cubed. So large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have proportionately less surface area, lose heat more
        slowly, and, pound for pound, need less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square-versus-cube</NUMEX> relationship makes the
        area of a solid proportional to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">third</NUMEX> power of its mass, so metabolic rate should
        also be proportional to mass
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/3</NUMEX> . For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> thought that it was.
        But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Kleiber</ENAMEX>, an animal physiologist working at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX>, re-examined the question, and found that, for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, metabolic rate was mass
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.73 ‚</NUMEX>Äîcloser to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three quarters</TIMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleiber</ENAMEX> looked at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> ranging in size from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> to a steer. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1930s</TIMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> had put
        together a ‚Äúmouse to elephant‚Äù curve that supported the three-quarter-power law, and by the
        1960s, the plot had been extended for everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>, still seeming to
        show the same relationship. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Quarter</TIMEX>-power scaling also began to stretch beyond metabolic
        rate. Biological times, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lifespan</ENAMEX> and heart rate, were found to be proportional to
        mass
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</NUMEX> , and fractions related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-quarter</NUMEX> show up in other scaling
        relationships: the diameter of the aorta and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree trunks</ENAMEX> is proportional to mass
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/8</NUMEX> , for example.
        It was, however, much harder to find a theoretical reason for why metabolic rate should
        be proportional to mass
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3/4 ‚Äîand</ENAMEX> more generally, why <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX>-power scaling laws should be so
        prevalent in biology. The impasse meant that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> interest in scaling had
        waned. But it sparked back into life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ecologists‚ÄîJames <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Enquist</ENAMEX>, now at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucson‚</ENAMEX>Äîand a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey West</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX>,
        developed a new explanation of why metabolic rate should equal the three-quarter power of
        body mass.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquist</ENAMEX>'s theory is based on the structure of biological distribution
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, such as blood vessels in vertebrates and xylem in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> assumed that
        metabolic rate equals the rate at which these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> deliver resources, and that
        evolution has minimized the time and energy needed to get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> from where they are
        taken up‚Äîthe lungs or roots, for example‚Äîto the cells. They also assumed that, although
        organisms vary greatly in size, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal units</ENAMEX> in their distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood capillaries</ENAMEX> or leaf stalks, do not.
        Bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> take longer to transport materials, and so use them more
        slowly. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the maximally efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> that serves
        every part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> has a fractal structure, showing the same geometry at different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX>. And the number of uniform <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal units</ENAMEX> in such a network‚Äîand so the rate at which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> are delivered to the cells‚Äîis proportional to the three-quarter power of body
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Pattern versus Variation
        Whether metabolic rate really varies with the three-quarter power of body mass is still
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">debated‚Äîsome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> still favor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX>, others think that no one exponent fits all
        the data‚Äîbut a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> favor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX>. And whether the fractal theory
        really explains the relationship of metabolic rate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size is also still contentious.
        In the most wide-ranging critique so far, published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this April</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan</ENAMEX>
        Kozlowski, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagiellonian University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Krakow</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marek Konarzewski</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
        Bialystok, claimed that the theory's maths could not simultaneously contain both uniform
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and three-quarter-power scaling, that large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> built along such lines
        would have more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> could contain, that biological scaling laws were
        not built around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> powers, and that biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were not generally branching
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractals</ENAMEX>.
        ‚ÄúI don't believe there's anything to explain‚Äîthere's no universal scaling exponent,‚Äù
        says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozlowski</ENAMEX>. He is also struck by what is left unexplained when size is accounted for:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of the same size can still show more than an order of magnitude variation in
        metabolic rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúWhat</ENAMEX>'s striking in nature is the variability,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere are
        regularities that call for explanation, but that doesn't mean ignoring the variability is
        correct.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Kozlowski</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-author</ENAMEX> of a theory that relates metabolic rate to cell size
        and the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> has, one of several alternative explanations of the
        scaling of metabolic rate published since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX> are serious, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is out‚Äîquestions about the
        fundamental maths are worrying a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.‚Äù On the other hand, he says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquist</ENAMEX>'s model seems a plausible template for designing an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, and its predictions
        fit real-world data remarkably well. Whether this fit truly captures the physical and
        chemical mechanisms underlying the patterns remains to be seen; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> hopes that
        criticism can strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquist</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, perhaps leading to a new,
        improved theory.
        The metabolic theory's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are not budging. ‚ÄúWe've yet to see a criticism we feel we
        can't answer pretty readily,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kozlowski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Konarzewski</ENAMEX>'s arguments are based
        on a misreading of the work, he says, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX> that focus on one aspect, such as the
        structure of mammalian vascular systems, miss the key point, which is generality: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIf we're
        wrong on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> powers, why do they keep showing up in everything from life-history
        processes to evolutionary rates?‚Äù
      
      
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sharks to Tomatoes</ENAMEX>
        After accounting for size, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> turned its attention to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most
        important influence on metabolism: temperature. The effect is exponential, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ¬∞C rise
        in body temperature equals a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 150%</NUMEX> rise in metabolic rate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> built an
        equation for metabolic rate that combined the mass
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3/4</TIMEX> term with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boltzmann</ENAMEX> factor. The latter is an expression of the
        probability that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules bumping into each other will spark a chemical reaction. The
        higher the temperature, the greater the probability, and the faster the reaction.
        Adding temperature explained much of the variation in metabolic rate that remained after
        adjusting for size. It also explained some of the metabolic differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For
        example, a reptile has a slower metabolic rate than a mammal of the same size. But
        adjusting for its lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> temperature removes much of the difference, suggesting that
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> share fundamental metabolic processes. The same even goes for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúWhen you correct for size and temperature, the metabolic rates of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>, a
        tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> are remarkably similar,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillooly</ENAMEX>, who joined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as a grad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> to work on the temperature question. It's not yet clear
        what the activation energy represents, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillooly</ENAMEX>. It could be a kind of average for all
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of chemical reactions in metabolism, or maybe the energy needed to get over
        one crucial hump in the path.
        The metabolic theory's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> component, resources, is also something of a black box at
        this stage. Nutrient supply, the team reasons, is the next most important determinant of
        metabolic rate, and will account for some of the remaining unexplained variation. As with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, the overall effect could be a balance of many processes, or it could be due to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> limiting element‚Äîthe growth of lake phytoplankton is often limited by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX>, for
        example, while for marine phytoplankton iron is usually the crucial nutrient. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s a work
        in progress,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúBut our vision for a metabolic theory of life is ultimately
        going to include material resource limitation.‚Äù
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> things still do not account for all the variation in metabolic rate, but
        more detailed knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> can yield more precise predictions. Using body size,
        altitude, and diet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian McNab</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gainesville</ENAMEX>, has explained
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.0%</NUMEX> of the variation in metabolic rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> of paradise (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.4%</NUMEX> of the
        rate variation in leaf-nosed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bats</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNab</ENAMEX> sees attempts to explain
        variation in metabolism using a few parameters applied across a wide range of sizes and
        taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, what isn't explained strikes him as forcefully as what is.
        ‚ÄúI have serious reservations as to whether there is a single relationship for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size
        and metabolic rate,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think we will be able to find generalizations in ecology,
        but they're not going to be simple‚Äîthere will be a bunch of clauses and restrictions, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have a lot of ways to bend the rules.‚Äù
        No theory matches data exactly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> points out; having a baseline prediction for
        metabolism lets you identify exceptional cases worthy of further investigation. Viewed from
        this angle, the metabolic theory is a kind of null hypothesis of how organisms work. ‚ÄúUntil
        you have a theory that makes a prediction, you don't know how to interpret any of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation,‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>. And, he adds, despite this variation, the underlying trends are
        also meaningful. ‚ÄúThere are themes of life that are deep-seated and fundamental.‚Äù
        All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of life needs energy. So if you know the rate at which an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">burns</ENAMEX> fuel‚Äîor if you know how big and hot it is, and apply the metabolic theory‚Äîyou can
        make a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of predictions about its biology, such as how fast it will grow and reproduce,
        and how long it will live.
        By correcting for mass and temperature, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gillooly</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> believe
        they have revealed underlying similarities in all the rates of life. The hatching times for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>-laying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, amphibians, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, and plankton, turn out to
        follow the same relationship‚Äîif a fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> were the same size and temperature as a bird
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>, it would take equally long to hatch (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The same goes for growth: a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and a
        mammal of equal size and temperature would gain mass at the same speed. And size and
        temperature even explain much of the variation in mortality rates between species‚Äîwhich one
        might have thought to be strongly dependent on external factors such as predators‚Äîperhaps
        through metabolism's influence on aging processes, such as free-radical damage to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        One <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rule for All</ENAMEX>?
        If all organisms work in the same way, understanding individual biology offers an
        obvious route to explaining nature's patterns‚Äîecological processes become a kind of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">meta-metabolism.</ENAMEX> Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> has used their theory to predict the flux of carbon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX> through forests‚Äîa measure more usually used to determine individual metabolic rate.
        They have also found that body size and temperature predict the densities and growth rates
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. So hotter environments should support lower population densities, as each
        individual consumes resources more quickly, leaving less to go round. One thing that does
        not scale with a quarter power of body size is the area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>' home ranges; this
        increases more or less linearly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> size. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, along with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton University</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Zoology</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, published a
        model that brought this, too, into the metabolic theory. They borrowed another trick from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physics</ENAMEX>, using an equation that describes colliding gas molecules to model the interactions
        between neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        Temperature could also explain why biodiversity peaks at the equator, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> believes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> with faster metabolisms have faster mutation rates. So the genomes of smaller,
        hotter <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> change more quickly, and they will also get through their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> more
        rapidly. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would therefore expect to see more new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> created in small <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and
        warm environments. The large-scale trend in all these rates‚Äîhatching time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and
        population growth, ecosystem metabolism, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA substitution‚Äîis</ENAMEX> closely proportional to a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> power of body mass.
        In the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> plans to examine the dynamics of colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and
        societies through the lens of metabolic ecology; instead of capillaries, the terminal units
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> would become <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. There are also many applied problems within
        the theory's scope, including some of the most significant human impacts on the biosphere.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Carbon emissions</ENAMEX> and the consequent global warming are increasing both the temperature and
        nutrient supply. And exploited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> often show a decrease in
        individual size, as larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are preferentially killed. Both these would tend to
        speed up biological processes. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> has
        found that the same model that describes the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> can also predict the
        growth of tumors, hinting that metabolic ecology may have medical applications.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> hopes that metabolic ecology will <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> become an uncontroversial part of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>' toolkits, like the theories <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> geneticists use to predict changes in
        the frequencies of genes. Before that happens, both the theory's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> have years of work ahead of them. Adopting the theory may also require a shift in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecologists</ENAMEX>' worldview. Most ecologists work by carrying out experimental manipulations on
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of similar organisms: the warblers in a woodland, for example, or the grasses
        of a meadow. When they build models, they do so from empirical data, not from physical
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> principles. The philosophy behind metabolic ecology disconcerts many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>,
        says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúA lot of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> are uncomfortable with thinking about data
        in these terms.‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozlowski</ENAMEX> doubts that simple theories can make precise predictions about the behavior of
        biological systems on large scales. He believes that metabolic ecology risks leading the
        discipline up a blind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIf I'm right, and the basic model contains an error,
        correcting the results will be a very long process. If they're not right, they'll have done
        a disservice to ecology.‚Äù
        But many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecologists</ENAMEX> are more optimistic that some unifying principles of nature can be
        found, and that metabolic ecology, and the debate around it, is a step in the right
        direction. Some think the theory may be part of an even grander idea. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hubbell</ENAMEX>, of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Georgia</ENAMEX>, is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> of another idea causing a stir among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecologists</ENAMEX>. Called neutral ecology, it proposes a general explanation of how competition
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> produces the dynamics of birth, death, and migration seen in
        ecosystems, and its predictions match closely the abundance and diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the
        wild. He believes that metabolic and neutral ecology can become elements of some larger
        theoretical framework.
        ‚ÄúI've never been more excited in my life,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbell</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúEcology</ENAMEX> now is like quantum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1930s‚</NUMEX>Äîwe're on the cusp of some major rearrangements and syntheses. I'm
        having a lot of fun.‚Äù
