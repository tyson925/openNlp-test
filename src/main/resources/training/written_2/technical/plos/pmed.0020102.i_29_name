        everyone deserves to be treated with dignity‚Äîthis is the tenet from which all other human
        rights flow. Another is that those who are most vulnerable deserve special protection.
        However, in many developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, vast numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are born but never counted,
        and their health and welfare throughout their lives remains unknown. And because
        single-mean measures of population health mask inequalities among the best-off and
        worst-off, the health of vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> is not effectively documented and
        acknowledged. Health information systems can play an important role in supporting these
        rights by documenting and tracking health and health inequities, and by creating a platform
        for action and accountability.
        A human rights approach to health information systems also supports effective health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. To effectively improve population health, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> need
        access to socioeconomically disaggregated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> health data. Because the relationship
        between such information and human rights has received little attention, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas of
        health information systems and human rights have done little to support each other.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Metrics Network</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Metrics Network</ENAMEX> (HMN) is a global collaboration focused on strengthening
        country health information systems to generate sound data for decision-making at country
        and global levels (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>who.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">int/healthmetrics/en/</ENAMEX>). Its interim secretariat is
        based at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organisation</ENAMEX>. The development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMN</ENAMEX> recently considered
        strategies for strengthening health information systems within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equity</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMN</ENAMEX> made recommendations that outlined the content of equity-sensitive
        information systems, identified opportunities for minimizing collection burdens, and
        suggested strategies to foster an equity-oriented decision-making culture. Although the
        recommendations were implicitly focused on human rights and on improving opportunity for
        the worst-off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, making that framework explicit helps us to acknowledge and
        clarify the values on which decisions for developing information systems are made. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework</ENAMEX> is based on several principles rooted in human rights and their implied actions
        (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sidebar</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual Matters</ENAMEX>
        Despite the acknowledged importance of counting everyone, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 57</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX> WHO member
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, almost all of which are developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, have vital registration systems that
        report on births and deaths for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 90%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Consequently, a primary
        recommendation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equity Working Group</ENAMEX> is that health information systems should
        support the most basic acknowledgment of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rights‚</ENAMEX>Äîone's existence‚Äîby counting births
        and deaths in every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> through a vital registration system (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
      
      
        Opportunities and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Means</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s human rights are recognized to include ‚Äúa standard of living adequate for the
        health and well-being of himself and of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, clothing, housing, and
        medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of‚Ä¶lack
        of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control‚Äù [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In other words, the means necessary
        to achieve health are part and parcel of a right to health. However, many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> studies
        have repeatedly shown that there are large gaps between the opportunities of advantaged and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disadvantaged</ENAMEX> sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. For example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, average household expenditure
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times the rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh</ENAMEX>
        were less likely to be brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> than their male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Examples
        demonstrating inequalities between various economic, ethnic, gender-based, and other social
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are replicated time and time again in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>].
        Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> have a health information system sufficient to support basic
        analysis of socioeconomic inequalities and health. Such a health information system would
        include the vital registration system coupled with a major household survey. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ninety</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have only a census, an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> survey, or no data at all, whereas the
        remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> fall into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmiddling‚Äù</ENAMEX> category (a census and a recent household
        survey, or two household surveys) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Bambas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Braveman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Dachs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Delgado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX>
        Gakidou, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> issues of health inequalities and human rights overlap in a number of ways that
        enrich a perspective on health as a human right. A human rights framework can inform a
        minimally acceptable level of data collection in health information systems‚Äîthat is, a core
        set of equity indicators‚Äîas well as the conditions surrounding the release and use of that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. In contrast to individual measures of health inequalities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> as units of
        analysis are especially useful for examining achievement of human rights (as well as
        identifying health inequities) since they indicate patterns of differential opportunity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> among various social strata. A human rights-oriented indicator of health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequalities</ENAMEX>, then, would be composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) A health measure, including
        health status, health care, and other determinants of health or the social/ economic
        consequences of ill health; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) A measure of social position/advantage (also called an
        equity stratifier or social stratifier) that defines strata in a hierarchy, e.g., income or
        economic assets, education, sex, or ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        Health differences across social strata in comparison with the most advantaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or
        an absolute standard suggest inequities in health [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>]. This interpretation of health
        inequities directly coincides with a human rights framework since it focuses on a broad
        concept of health as well as on means to and opportunities for health. Critical issues of
        methodology for using these indicators also need attention, including identification of
        appropriate measures of social position and how to meaningfully compare indicators across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        Consequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equity Working Group</ENAMEX> recommended that health information systems
        should include the information necessary to create equity indicators, and that research
        into methodologies should be given due attention. On a practical level, equity strata and
        health indicators can be integrated into a number of existing data sources, including
        censuses, vital registries, household surveys, small areas data, and administrative data
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Such empirical information not only clarifies distributions of health and
        achievement of rights but can also identify barriers to health and provide insights on
        multi-sectoral approaches in planning and interventions to support the most vulnerable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Accountability and Autonomy
        When equity-sensitive information is collected, access to information is often
        restricted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and is rarely disaggregated to show differences between
        socioeconomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. But a human rights approach to health information implies not only
        particular content but also mechanisms to promote the effective use of information,
        including the public release of data in a useful form.
        Confidentiality and privacy issues arise in relation to information disaggregated by
        equity stratifiers, especially in the context of the public release of such data. There are
        strong arguments for the public release of health equity information, including the fact
        that such information is a determinant of health, and that civil society can play a vital
        role in improving health opportunities, both directly and by influencing governmental
        priorities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>'s general lack of knowledge regarding patterns of health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inequalities</ENAMEX> and their causes within societies further supports the need for the public
        release of such information.
        If information is disaggregated for very small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, such as within a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>,
        particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> may be identifiable and feel their privacy rights were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impinged</ENAMEX> upon. Therefore, the public release of equity-oriented information on health
        should be explicitly planned for in the development of health information systems.
        Principles to guide release of disaggregated data should be followed, and communities
        should have a voice in the decision to release highly disaggregated information when
        privacy rights might be compromised. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMN Equity Working Group</ENAMEX> suggests development of
        international standards for collection and sharing of disaggregated data and its use. Given
        the potential conflict between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX>, we should continue to investigate
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">technologic</ENAMEX> and/or policy solutions.
      
      
        Mutual Responsibility
        Another mechanism for promoting the effective use of information is to support cultures
        of equity-oriented decision-making. In addition to the public release of information,
        strategies should include supporting research on pathways of health inequities and
        interventions; building capacity for analyzing information and developing interventions;
        encouraging demand for equity-sensitive data in government and the public; and supporting
        broad participation in the promotion of health equity.
        Standards for improvements and target dates for achieving a minimally acceptable
        information system should take into account differences in the resources and needs of those
        implementing changes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equity Working Group</ENAMEX> recommended that target dates be developed
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to define and integrate core equity indicators into routine information
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> should be able to achieve, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 5‚Äì15 years</TIMEX>, at least the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">middle-level</ENAMEX> information system, which could be considered a minimum standard. However, the
        rationale for this standard is predicated on the assumption of significant financial and
        technical support being given to the effort, and on the least well-off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> receiving
        the most support (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Bambas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Braveman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Dachs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Delgado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Gakidou</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished data).
      
      
        Conclusion
        These recommendations provide a strategy for strengthening decision- and policy-making
        by providing a stronger empirical base for human rights considerations. This
        equity-oriented empirical base could strengthen health rights, not only through health
        sector decision-making, but also through decision-making in sectors related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">determinants</ENAMEX>.
        The initial development stage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMN</ENAMEX> has now ended, and hopefully the refinement and
        implementation stages of the effort will begin within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</TIMEX>. Regardless of the
        existence of a centralized effort, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> would greatly promote health rights by
        integrating equity issues into health information systems, releasing that information
        publicly, and supporting participation and decision-making attentive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of
        health equity and human rights.
