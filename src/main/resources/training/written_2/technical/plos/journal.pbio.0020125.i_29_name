        to aggregate in cells. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> aggregates are capable of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúdividing‚Äù</ENAMEX> and propagating in
        cells, leading to formation of similar aggregates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells or even in neighboring
        cells due to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúinfection.‚Äù These self-propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> aggregates are called prions and
        constitute the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prion diseases</ENAMEX>. The infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> is an
        abnormal conformation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (PrP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sc</ENAMEX> ), which makes it protease-resistant and initiates its aggregation
        (Prusiner <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). The abnormal aggregated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> can recruit normal soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PrP</ENAMEX> molecules
        into aggregates, thus inactivating them. The aggregates of PrP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sc</ENAMEX> can proliferate within cells and be transmitted to other cells and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, leading to the spread of neurotoxicity.
      
      
        Prion Domains
        While so far <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> prion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is known in mammals, several prion-like proteins
        capable of forming self-propagating aggregates have been found in various yeast species.
        The common structural feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prion proteins</ENAMEX> is the so-called prion domain,
        characterized by the high content of glutamines (Q) and asparagines (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePace et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelitsch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Weissman 2000</ENAMEX>), also known as the Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich domain. The prion domains
        are the major structural determinants that are solely responsible for the polypeptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> and propagation of the aggregates. Interestingly, the mammalian PrP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sc</ENAMEX> is fundamentally different from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prions</ENAMEX>, since it lacks a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q/N</ENAMEX>-rich domain, indicating that distinct structural features are responsible for its
        ability to form self-propagating aggregates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q/N</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prions</ENAMEX> are
        transferable in that, when fused to a heterologous polypeptide, they confer prion
        properties to this polypeptide. With a low probability, soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with prion domains
        can change conformation to form self-propagating aggregates, which can be transmitted to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">daughter cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindquist 1997)</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). As with PrP
        Sc , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> prions efficiently recruit soluble molecules of the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, thus inactivating them (Lindquist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; Chernoff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wickner et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). Also
        with low probability, the aggregation-prone conformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prion proteins</ENAMEX> can
        reverse to a soluble functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX>. Certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prion proteins</ENAMEX>, when in soluble
        conformation, function in important pathways; e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sup35</TIMEX> (forming [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prion</ENAMEX>) controls termination of translation, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ure2</TIMEX> (forming [URE3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prion</ENAMEX>) controls some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX> transporter systems. Aggregation of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> leads to phenotypes (e.g., suppression of nonsense mutations or transport
        defects) inherited in a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mendelian</ENAMEX> fashion owing to the nonchromosomal basis of the
        inheritance.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inheriting Variations</ENAMEX>
        A remarkable feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prion proteins</ENAMEX> is their ability to produce distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inherited ‚Äúvariants‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the prion. For example, [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prion</ENAMEX> could exist in several distinct forms that suppress
        termination of translation to different degrees. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúvariants‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prions</ENAMEX> are
        analogous to different prion ‚Äústrains‚Äù of PrP
        Sc , which cause versions of the disease with different incubation
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> and different patterns of brain pathology. The molecular nature of distinct PrP
        Sc <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> is determined by specific stable conformations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PrP</ENAMEX>.
        Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúvariants‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prions</ENAMEX> are explained by different stable conformation states
        of the corresponding prion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chien et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). Strict conformation requirements
        for aggregate formation can also explain interspecies transmission barriers, where prion
        domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sup35</ENAMEX> derived from other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> species cannot cause formation of [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] prion in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX> cerevisiae, in spite of a high degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX>. This observation is very intriguing, especially in light of a recent finding that
        prion conformation of some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is required for formation of prions by the other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. For example, for de novo formation of [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prion</ENAMEX>, a distinct prion [RNQ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] should be present in a cell (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derkatch et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osherovich</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Weissman 2001</ENAMEX>), probably in order to cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> Sup35 aggregates. This is in spite of
        relatively limited homology between the prion domains of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The apparent
        contradiction between the interspecies transmission barriers of very homologous prion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and possible cross-seeding of aggregates by prion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with more limited
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> represents an interesting biological problem. On the other hand, this apparent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contradiction</ENAMEX> may indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prion</ENAMEX> formation is a more complicated process than we
        currently think and that it may involve many cellular factors.
      
      
        What Do Prions Do?
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prions</ENAMEX> have been studied for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost ten years</TIMEX>, very little is known about
        their biological significance. We do not know the functions of the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        that can exist as prions. Even if a function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prion proteins</ENAMEX>, such as with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sup35</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ure2</TIMEX>,
        is known, we do not understand the biological significance of their ‚Äúprionization,‚Äù i.e.,
        that they aggregate and propagate in the aggregated form. A very intriguing and unexpected
        finding was that formation of [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] prion causes a wide variety of phenotypic alterations, which depend
        on the strain background (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindquist 2000).</ENAMEX> In fact, comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> strains of
        different origin, each with and without [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prion</ENAMEX>, showed that certain strains with [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prion</ENAMEX> have different sensitivity to stresses and antibiotics than
        their non-prion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX>, despite their genetic identity. In some strains, cells with
        [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] prion demonstrated better survival than their non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">prion</ENAMEX> counterparts
        in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of translation or microtubules, heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>, low pH, and
        other deleterious conditions, which of course gives a strong advantage to the [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] cells. It is likely that some genomic mutations could be suppressed
        and therefore become silent when termination of translation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sup35</TIMEX> is partially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactivated</ENAMEX> in [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] prion cells (Lindquist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindquist 2000).</ENAMEX> [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] could also reveal previously silent mutations or their combinations.
        It was hypothesized that switches between prion and non-prion forms of Sup35 enhance
        survival in fluctuating environments and provide a novel instrument for evolution of new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traits</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q/N</ENAMEX> Does Not Necessarily a Prion Make
        Searching genomes of various species demonstrated that a relatively large fraction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 0.1% and 2%</NUMEX>) contain Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelitsch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Weissman 2000</ENAMEX>) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyQ</ENAMEX> or polyN sequences. These domains are often found in transcription factors, protein
        kinases, and components of vesicular transport. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q/N</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> usually are not
        evolutionary conserved and their functional role is largely unknown. Some of the Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich
        or polyQ domains facilitate aggregation of polypeptides, especially if expanded owing to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. Such expansion of the polyQ domains in certain neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> could cause
        neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Huntington's disease</ENAMEX> or several forms of ataxia.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, aggregates formed by polypeptides with the Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich or polyQ domains are not
        necessarily self-propagating aggregates, i.e., prions. In fact, there are additional
        structural properties of the polypeptides that provide the self-propagation (see below).
        Even if a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a polyQ domain does not form a prion, its aggregation may depend on
        certain prions. For example, recent experiments demonstrated that [RNQ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prion</ENAMEX> dramatically stimulated aggregation of fragments of
        recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">huntingtin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ataxin-3</ENAMEX> with an expanded polyQ domain cloned in yeast
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osherovich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Weissman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meriin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). [RNQ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] facilitated the nucleation phase of the huntingtin fragment
        aggregation, suggesting that this prion can be directly involved in seeding of the
        aggregates. The major question now is whether there are analogous prion-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        mammalian cells that are involved in aggregation of huntingtin or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ataxin-3</ENAMEX> and subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neurodegenerative disease</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> indication that mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> can form
        self-propagating prions came from recent work with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of translation cytoplasmic
        polyadenylation element-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (CPEB) from 
        Aplysia neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> The neuronal form of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q/N</ENAMEX>-rich domain similar to the prion domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prions</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q/N</ENAMEX>-rich domain from CPEB
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPEBQ</ENAMEX>), when fused to green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP), conferred upon it prion-like
        properties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPEBQ‚</ENAMEX>ÄìGFP fusion polypeptide existed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> in one of the three
        distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, i.e., soluble, many small aggregates, or few large aggregates. Mother
        cells almost always gave rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPEBQ‚</ENAMEX>ÄìGFP polypeptide was in
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, indicating the ability of these aggregates to be inherited, i.e., to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">self-propagate.</ENAMEX> Furthermore, full-length 
        Aplysia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CPEB protein</ENAMEX>, when cloned in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, can also exist in two
        distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, soluble and aggregated, which is an inherited feature. Very unexpectedly,
        unlike other prions, the aggregated state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPEB</ENAMEX> was more functionally active than the
        soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">form</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> These data strongly suggest that metazoan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Q/N</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> are potentially capable of forming prions. The challenge now will be to
        establish whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPEB</ENAMEX> can exist as a self-propagating aggregate in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aplysia</ENAMEX> or mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">neurons</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Mystery of Propagation
        What makes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> aggregates in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast propagate</ENAMEX>? The key cellular element that is
        critical for this process is molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX> Hsp104 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chernoff et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>). This factor
        is specifically required for maintenance of all known prions within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> and
        probably is not involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prion</ENAMEX> formation (i.e., initial protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aggregation</ENAMEX>). [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</NUMEX> seeds of this prion (although this number
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differed</ENAMEX> in different [PSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ] isolates), and maintenance of about this number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> after cell
        divisions requires functional Hsp104 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eaglestone et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). In fact, in the absence of
        Hsp104, prion aggregates continue to grow without increase in number and are rapidly lost
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">generations</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wegrzyn et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). Since this chaperone can directly bind to protein
        aggregates and promote there disassembly (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glover</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lindquist 1998</ENAMEX>), it was suggested that
        the main function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hsp104</ENAMEX> in prion inheritance is to disaggregate large prion aggregates
        to smaller elements, thus leading to formation of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kushnirov</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ter-Avanesyan</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). Interestingly, although Hsp104 is conserved among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, fungi, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>,
        animal cells do not have this chaperone or its close homologs. Therefore, if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>-type
        prions with Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> exist in animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, there should be alternative factors
        that disaggregate large prion aggregates into smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in order to keep the number
        of seeds relatively constant and thus maintain the prions.
        The fact that some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich domains form self-propagating aggregates,
        while others can aggregate but cannot form prions, suggests that there should be some
        structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> either within the Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich sequence or close to it that confer the
        ability to propagate. In an article in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osherovich et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> examined sequence
        requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prion</ENAMEX> formation and maintenance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> prion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sup35 and New1</TIMEX>.
        They noted that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prion proteins</ENAMEX> contain an oligopeptide repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QGGYQ</ENAMEX> in close proximity
        to Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> and examined the functional significance of the repeats for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> and maintenance of the prions. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New1</TIMEX>, in contrast to a deletion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, deletion of the repeat did not affect aggregation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or formation of
        the prion, but abrogated inheritance of the prion. With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sup35</TIMEX>, the situation was somewhat
        more complicated, since repeats adjacent to Q/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich domain affected both protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> and prion maintenance while more distant repeats affected only the prion
        inheritance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggested that the oligopeptide repeats facilitate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregates</ENAMEX>, either by serving as binding sites for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp104</TIMEX> or by altering the conformation
        of the polypeptides in aggregates to promote access for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp104</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        The likely possibility was that the oligopeptide repeats could be interchangeable
        between different prions, leading to creation of novel chimeric prions. In fact, the
        authors constructed an F chimera, a fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-rich domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">New1</ENAMEX> and the
        oligopeptide repeat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sup35</TIMEX>. This fusion polypeptide efficiently formed prion [F
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> ]. Furthermore, when the oligopeptide repeat sequence was added to a
        polyQ sequence, this fusion polypeptide also acquired the ability to form self-propagating
        aggregates. This work, therefore, clarifies the architecture of prions by defining two
        structural motifs in prion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have distinct functions in aggregation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propagation</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, not all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast prions</ENAMEX> have similar oligopeptide repeat motifs,
        indicating that distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> could confer prion properties to polypeptides that can
        aggregate. It would be important to identify these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in order to understand the
        mechanisms of aggregate propagation. The work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osherovich et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) may help to
        identify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from mammalian cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that can potentially form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prions</ENAMEX>. Finding these novel prions could be of very high significance since they may
        provide insight into a wide range of currently unexplained epigenetic phenomena.
