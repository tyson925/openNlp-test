        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biochemist</ENAMEX> discards the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> from her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX> indulges in
        designer chocolate with a clear conscience. The demographer sticks to vitamin supplements,
        and while the evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> calculates the compensations of celibacy, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population biologist</ENAMEX> transplants gonads, but so far only those of his laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        Their common cause is to control and extend the healthy lifespan of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. They want to
        cure ageing and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that come with it.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œI</ENAMEX> would take resveratrol if it were feasible,â€ notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sinclair</ENAMEX>, assistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of pathology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Medical School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>. In the meantime,
        he adds, â€œI do enjoy a glass of red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> about once a day.â€ It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>,
        in association with a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, that revealed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last August</TIMEX> how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> had
        identified for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a group of simple organic molecules capable of extending
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX>. The most proficient of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is resveratrol, the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyphenol</ENAMEX> found in
        red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, and its discovery as a potential elixir to combat ageing represents another
        extraordinary advance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of discoveries that have revolutionised the field.
        
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œThese</ENAMEX> molecules will be useful for treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> associated with
            ageing, like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>.â€
          
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Extending Life</ENAMEX>
        Although the life-enhancing effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair</ENAMEX>'s polyphenols are so far confined to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baker</ENAMEX>'s yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the work suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> small step from making a giant leap for humankind. â€œPeople imagined that it
        might have been possible, but few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thought that it was going to be possible so
        quickly to find such things,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX>. The field of ageing research is buzzing.
        Resveratrol stimulated a known activator of increased longevity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, the enzyme
        Sir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and thereby extended the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s lifespan by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). Sir-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> belongs to a
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in higher organisms, including SIR-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>, an enzyme that
        regulates lifespan in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SIRT-1</ENAMEX>, the human enzyme that promotes cell survival
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> still do not know whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SIRT-1</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œSir-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,â€ as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair</ENAMEX> puts it, has anything to do with longevity, there is a good chance that it does,
        judging by its pedigree. In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resveratrol</ENAMEX> proved to be a potent activator of the
        human enzyme. This might not be altogether surprising, at least not now, given that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphenol</ENAMEX> is already associated with health benefits in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, notably the mitigation of
        such age-related defects as neurodegeneration, carcinogenesis, and atherosclerosis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œThe</ENAMEX> study came out from a pretty big gamble,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX>, who used the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> to screen and identify molecules that he expected would also stimulate those related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> in lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SIRT-1</ENAMEX>, these related enzymes are known to increase
        longevity when activated, usually by restricting the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s calorie intake. Not only
        did they find â€œa whole collection of related polyphenols that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activate â€˜Sir-2</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,â€™
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¦</ENAMEX> but we put them onto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, justbeing the simplest model, and amazingly [they] did what
        we were hoping [they] would do,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX>. â€œBut it was a real long shot.â€
        Now there's great eagerness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> to complete and publish related
        research, notably by replicating the yeast work in higher organisms. â€œWe have very
        promising results in 
        Drosophila , which is a huge jump from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair</ENAMEX>. â€œSo we're very encouraged by that.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Publication</ENAMEX> of these results is imminent. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> has also quickly broadened its horizons and is already testing the polyphenols on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mouse disease</ENAMEX> models. â€œWe think we may have tapped into a cell survival and defence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">programme</ENAMEX> [and] that these molecules will be useful for treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> associated with
        ageing, like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX>. He hopes to publish the diabetes
        results by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2004</TIMEX> and those for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and BIOMOL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Laboratories</ENAMEX>, its commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, have already filed a
        patent application for the use of â€œsynthetic related moleculesâ€ to combat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ageingâ€”an</ENAMEX> application, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX> adds, â€œvery much linked to the [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyphenols</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.â€
        There's been a radical shift in attitude towards ageing, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX>. Before the
        1990s, â€œpeople thought that we were a lot like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, that we would just rust and
        breakdownâ€”nothing we could do about it. The new idea is that there are pathways that can
        boost our defences against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ageingâ€”the â€˜ageing-</ENAMEX>can-be-regulatedâ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">€™ discovery â€¦</ENAMEX> that genes can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ageing</ENAMEX> [and] that there are pathways that [we can use to] slow down the process,â€
        he says. â€œIf that's trueâ€”and it really seems to be true for a lot of organismsâ€”if it's true
        for us, it really means that there is hope that we will be able, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, to find small
        molecules that can alter these pathways.â€
      
      
        How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Long Could We Live?</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair</ENAMEX> expects to see such developments within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his lifetime</TIMEX>, but he ridicules the
        notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> will experience anything like the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> extension to lifespan of his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. â€œIt'll be great if we can just give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> an extra <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> and have
        less disease in their old age and make it less painful,â€ he says. â€œWe won't be seeing any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methuselahs</ENAMEX> around,â€ he insists.
        On his side are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Vaupel</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s leading demographers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Mangel</ENAMEX>, a
        mathematical modeller at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>. â€œSince <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX>, life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectancy</ENAMEX> has been going up at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.5 years</TIMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> and will continue at this rate, maybe
        a little faster,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaupel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Laboratory of Survival and Longevity</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Max</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck Institute for Demographic Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rostock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> currently
        have the highest average life expectancy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>, he notes: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œSo the figure could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six decades</TIMEX>, but not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500.â</NUMEX>€ There's remarkably little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can do even if they want to
        live as long as possible, he says. â€œGive up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX>, lose weight, don't drive when drunk,
        install a smoke detector, take regular exercise,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaupel</ENAMEX>, who insists he does them
        all, as well as taking vitamin supplements.
        
          
            â€œYou look at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> and think, â€˜Oh my God, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> should be
            dead.â€™ But they're not. They're moving around.â€
          
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mangel</ENAMEX> sees the problem of assessing the limitations of ageing research as fairly
        straightforward. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mathematical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, he says, could solve it by linking demographic
        properties and physiological developments. â€œWe've had a separation of the biology of ageing
        and the demography of ageing, and they need to come together again,â€ notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mangel</ENAMEX>, whose
        personal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-ageing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> involves taking â€œa dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-oxidant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> with a good
        feeling.â€
        But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cythnia Kenyon</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> that it had generated a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-fold
        increase in the lifespan of its nematodes, is not so sure about the limitations. â€œYou look
        at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> and think, â€˜Oh my God, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> should be dead.â€™ But they're not. They're
        moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aroundâ€¦</ENAMEX>. Once you get your brain wrapped around that â€¦ then you start thinking, oh
        my goodness, so lifespan is something you can changeâ€”it's plastic. Then who knows what the
        limit is?â€ (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Kenyon</ENAMEX> has recorded video clips of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superstars</ENAMEX> of her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>, 
        Caenorhabditis elegans , to show how long-lived mutant nematodes
        are as vigorous as normal young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Videos 1â€“4</ENAMEX>].)
        Warming to the theme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX> hypothesises: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œIf you'd asked me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many generations ago</TIMEX>, when
        we were actually common precursors of worms and flies, â€˜Cynthia, you have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lifespan</ENAMEX>, do you think that you could [live longer]?â€™ And if I'd told you, â€˜Well, I think
        our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> will live <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> times longer,â€™ you'd have said, â€˜Oh, come on!â€™ But we do.
        It happened,â€ she notes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWho</ENAMEX> knows what you could do in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>?â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX> muses. â€œI don't want to go on record
        saying that it's not possible in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> because I don't see why it wouldn't beâ€¦. I'm
        certainly not imagining that my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> is going to come up with a
        compound that can make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>. That seems just preposterous.â€ So the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timescale</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œNo</ENAMEX>, not necessarily,â€ she insists, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œbecause</ENAMEX> once we
        understand the mechanism, then we can intervene and see what we can accomplish.â€
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signalling Life</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sweet 16</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> of biochemistry and biophysics at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX>, is among the key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> responsible for showing that a single gene, and
        subsequently many genes, can change an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s lifespan.
        
          â€œIt is inconceivable â€¦ that a life-extending therapy will ever be developed that is
          able to extend life independent of every other change.â€
        
        In a seminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> showed that mutations in
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daf</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> gene doubled the lifespan of the nematode 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daf-2</ENAMEX> encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> that is similar to those for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and
        insulin-like growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-1</ENAMEX> (IGF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>; this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone receptor</ENAMEX> normally speeds up
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ageing</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, but the mutations inhibit its action and enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to live
        longer. Before the results appeared, there was a â€œvery negative attitudeâ€ towards ageing
        research, recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>. Since then, and especially over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> in response to
        later findings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate students</ENAMEX> have been scrambling for a chance to work in her
        laboratory. â€œYou can't believe the differenceâ€”there was such resistance to it,â€ she says. â€œ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daf-2</ENAMEX> made a huge difference.â€ But then so did her subsequent research in
        the field.
        Among her most significant findings is the identification of many more longevity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>;
        the results, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, derive directly from her early work on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daf-2</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWe</ENAMEX> discovered that in order for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">long-lived worms</ENAMEX> to live so
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, they need another gene called 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">daf-16</ENAMEX> ,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>. â€œ
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daf-16</ENAMEX> is kind of the opposite of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daf-2</ENAMEX> , in the sense that it promotes longevity and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">youthfulness â€¦</ENAMEX> so we
        call it â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">€˜sweet 16.â</NUMEX>€™â€ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">daf-16</ENAMEX> encodes a transcription factor that controls the expression of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. â€œThey don't do just one thing, they do many things,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>. They
        can act as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-oxidants</ENAMEX> (to prevent damage from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>), as chaperones (to
        prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misfolded proteins</ENAMEX> from forming aggregates), as antimicrobials (to protect against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and fungi), and as metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        â€œSo the picture that emerges is that the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/IGF-1</ENAMEX> hormone system produces
        these enormous effects on lifespan is by coordinating the expression of many genes that do
        different things to affect lifespan, each of which on its own has only a small effect,â€
        notes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œIt</ENAMEX>'s as though 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daf-2</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">daf-16</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, would be the conductors of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>. They
        bring together the flutes and the violins and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> horns, each of which do different
        things, and they make them all work together in concert.â€
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX> is unequivocal about the bottom line: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œNow we have a whole set of genes whose
        biochemical functions we can be working on to understand more about the actual mechanisms
        of ageing.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Complementary</ENAMEX> results in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> and mammals persuade her to be more explicit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œThe</ENAMEX> common ancestor of worms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> must have had an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>/IGF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-like hormone
        system that controlled ageing. And that ability has been maintained. So the question is,
        has [that ability] been lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>? I think it's quite likely that it will also
        function in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, but there isn't a direct demonstration yet that that's the case.â€
        Nevertheless, the discoveries about the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/IGF-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> in ageing have
        had a profound impact on her own lifestyle, which includes a tendency to discard the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> and eat only the toppings of pizzas (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>). â€œI'm on a low-carb diet. I
        gave my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms glucose</ENAMEX>, and it shortened their lifespan. [The diet] makes sense because it
        keeps your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels down,â€ she says.
        â€œCaloric restriction extends lifespan of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and so does the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/IGF-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX>,â€
        she notes. Indeed, starting a low-calorie diet at any point in adulthood appears to help
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> flies live longer, according to research in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last September</TIMEX>. â€œWhat
        we don't know for sure in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX> continues, â€œis whether the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> are
        different or the same.â€
        While much ageing research focuses on these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> influences, she says that there are
        another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas of investigation. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2002</TIMEX> that
        inhibiting the respiration of mitochondria in developing worms increased longevity, but
        that it had no effect in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, for reasons still unexplained, she says. Further
        microarray analysis is underway to pinpoint whether the cause simply lies downstream of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">insulin/IGF-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> or whether it is something different altogether.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price of Life</ENAMEX>
        Then there's research looking at the effects on lifespan of changes to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> system. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>, such work often involves a battle to convince sceptics
        that longevity is not a trade-off with fertility. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years ago</TIMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> reported
        that killing germ cells increases the lifespan of worms by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>, but only because, she
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stresses</ENAMEX>, it affects endocrine signalling and not because it prevents reproduction. Further
        research, published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, showed quite clearly, she says, that ageing and reproduction
        are controlled independently of one another. And as for her recent work on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">infertile worms</ENAMEX>,
        which lived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times as long as normal following the removal of their entire reproductive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, she says: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œIf we could intervene in the hormone signalling pathways directly, we
        think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> would still live <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times as long as normal, but would be fertile as
        well.â€
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Carey</ENAMEX> is one of those â€œtrade-offâ€ sceptics. He is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population biologist</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Davis</ENAMEX> and his research, on the effect on life expectancy of
        replacing the ovaries of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with ovaries from younger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, is intended to complement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyon</ENAMEX>'s work. But he insists that â€œan honest discussion of lifespan extension must include
        consideration of tradeoffs.â€ Many manipulations that extend lifespan in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX>,
        whether genetic or dietary, for example, ignore or gloss over the side effects, such as
        permanent sterility, huge weight loss, distorted organ-to-body ratios, or major behavioural
        aberrations, he notes. â€œIt is inconceivable to me that a life-extending therapy will ever
        be developed that is able to extend life independent of every other change,â€ he concludes.
        â€œAll life systems are interlinked and hierarchically integrated at all levels, so to talk
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> life extension using analogies with a car warranty concept is wrong-headed.â€
        Another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â€œtrade-offâ</NUMEX>€ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sceptic</ENAMEX> takes a different tack. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armand Leroi</ENAMEX> puts it: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œDuring</ENAMEX>
        occasional periods of involuntary celibacy I have thought, well, I may not be getting laid,
        but at least I shall live to a miserable and solitary old age.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Leroi</ENAMEX>, an evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial College of Science, Technology</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, offers an
        optimistic appraisal of the chances of finding a cure for ageing in his new book about the
        effects of genetic variety on the human body. He sees ageing simply as a collection of
        curable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œThere is no obvious impediment to that advance, nothing to make us think
        that human beings have a fixed lifespan.â€
