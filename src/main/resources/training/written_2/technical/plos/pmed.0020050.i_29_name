        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic is having a devastating impact in sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>-constrained regions. Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> have committed to expand access to antiretrovirals (ARVs) in the developing
        world, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has pledged to provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 billion</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carribean</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prices have fallen [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. However, even if these resources are
        provided for the global treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in need of treatment
        will far exceed the supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Thus, difficult decisions will have to be made as
        to how to design <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment strategies with these scarce resources. Resource allocation
        decisions can be made on the basis of many different epidemiological, ethical, or
        preferential treatment priority criteria. Many diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have been suggested for
        treatment priority in resource-limited regions, including the following: only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, pregnant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, the sickest, the most economically productive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the
        military, or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> of the dominant ethnic group [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. It has also been proposed
        that a lottery would be the only fair approach to allocating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Only a limited
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> will be available, and only a fixed number of health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> (HCFs)
        can be used for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARV</ENAMEX> distribution. Thus, the resource allocation decisions that need to be
        made are extremely complex.
        Here, we use operations research to address this important resource allocation problem
        and to design ARV allocation strategies that are rational and equitable. The allocation
        decisions that we make here are based on ethical criteria, and not on epidemiological or
        preferential treatment priority criteria. Specifically, we determine the optimal allocation
        strategy that would ensure that each individual with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> has an equal chance of receiving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX>. We present a novel spatial mathematical model of treatment accessibility that we use
        in conjunction with an equity objective function to determine an optimal equitable
        allocation strategy (OEAS) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> in a resource-constrained region. We quantify how
        changing the size of the catchment region surrounding each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>, and the number of HCFs
        utilized for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARV</ENAMEX> distribution, alters the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>. Specifically, we use data from the detailed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> rollout plan designed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> to determine an OEAS (based
        upon a variety of assumptions) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal.</ENAMEX> We also discuss how our
        proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> allocation strategy differs from the currently proposed plan.
        Our current analysis is applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal</ENAMEX>, although
        our methodology could be applied to any resource-constrained setting. KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal is the
        largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.4 million</NUMEX> and has
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 21%</NUMEX> of all cases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]). We use data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>) in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal</ENAMEX>; we exclude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are not available on the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in each specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, and thus we use the estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> prevalence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 13%</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> areas and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> in rural areas [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]) to estimate the number of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. See Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> for the population sizes and spatial locations of each
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> used in our analysis. For our analysis the quantity of ARVs available
        for distribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> is sufficient to treat <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the total number of infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, which is a realistic level during the incremental scale-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> therapy over the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> has selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> to participate in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> rollout that began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2004</TIMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> HCFs are distributed throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>
        (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX>, whilst others are a great
        distance from any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>, with a range of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0‚Äì90 km</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). Hence, this spatial
        distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> produces large heterogeneity in accessibility to treatment. Inequality
        in access to health care is a common characteristic of resource-constrained regions
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,6,7,8,9,10</NUMEX>]. We explicitly consider heterogeneity in treatment accessibility in our
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> allocation strategies.
        We have developed a novel spatial mathematical model of treatment accessibility that we
        use to determine an OEAS for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> in a resource-constrained region. To the best of our
        knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysis to address how to deal with the extremely difficult
        problem of allocating a scarce supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> in order to design a rational and equitable
        allocation strategy. We model the ‚Äúspatial diffusion of treatment‚Äù to the locations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, rather than modeling the ‚Äúspatial diffusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which is the conventional
        approach [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,12,13,14,15,16</NUMEX>]. Our spatial model includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> and the HIV-infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> surrounding these HCFs; we refer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> around each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> as the catchment
        region. Thus, the radius of the catchment region specifies the approximate maximum distance
        that we assume infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would be willing (or able) to travel for treatment. Each HCF
        can serve many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> can access multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX>; our model sums
        the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>'s catchment region who could potentially travel
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> to receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> (we define this number as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúeffective demand‚Äù</ENAMEX> on that
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>). Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúeffective demand‚Äù</ENAMEX> on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> is a direct function of the number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in the catchment region, weighted by their distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>.
        By including a weighting function we explicitly model heterogeneity in accessibility to
        treatment based on distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>. Here, the distance from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HCF</ENAMEX> becomes the main
        determinant influencing whether or not an individual with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> has access to treatment.
        We developed an equity objective function to assess how the limited supply of ARVs
        should be allocated to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> to ensure that an equal proportion of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> receive treatment. To apply our theoretical framework to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KwaZulu‚</ENAMEX>ÄìNatal we
        model the specific location of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> or more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>); for these conditions we determine an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>. We compared our OEAS
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other allocation strategies: (i) allocating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durban</ENAMEX>, the major urban
        area (i.e., concentrating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> where there is the best health-care infrastructure) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allocating ARVs</ENAMEX> equally to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX>. We conduct our analysis assuming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
        radii of catchment regions: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km, 40 km</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km.</NUMEX> We then extend this analysis and
        recalculate the OEAS assuming that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 17</NUMEX> HCFs are available to distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX>. This
        analysis is useful because there is a second potential pool of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> ARV-implementation HCFs
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> operational plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollout</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. We analyze this case, in which
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> HCFs are utilized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> rollout, and we also analyze how optimal ARV allocation
        would change if all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KwaZulu‚</ENAMEX>ÄìNatal were operational for the rollout of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Calculating Demand and Treatment Access
          We assume that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> who will travel to a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> is
          directly proportional to the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in that particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
          but that the probability of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> traveling to receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> (i.e., the treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accessibility</ENAMEX>) decreases with distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>. We define 
          d
          i,j as the distance from community 
          i to HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>, f (
          d
          i,j ) as a weighting function that determines the treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accessibility</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> based upon distance 
          d
          i,j , and 
          I
          i as the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in community 
          i . The distance, 
          d
          ij , between community 
          i and HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> is based on the longitude (lon) and latitude (lat) of each location
          and is determined by
          
          where 
          R is the radius of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, taken to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,371 km</NUMEX>, and the angles are
          in radian measure. We calculate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúeffective demand‚Äù</ENAMEX> of community 
          i on HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> to be the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in community 
          i that will travel to HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> regimes, namely, 
          f (
          d
          i,j )
          I
          i . Thus, demand on HCFs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> is reduced by the treatment
          accessibility function. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is conceptually similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúgravity‚Äù</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that
          have been used to predict retail travel [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], plan land use [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], and determine
          accessibility of primary care [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. However, this is to our knowledge the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time this
          approach has been used to calculate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> allocations. We use a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> to model treatment
          accessibility, 
          f (
          d ) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exp</ENAMEX>(‚àí
          kd
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> is a dispersal length scale parameter determining the radius of the
          catchment region. The size of the actual catchment regions is unknown, but based upon
          distances from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) we assume that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are likely to travel a maximum distance of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003786</NUMEX>). We vary the catchment region by considering a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-km</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radius</ENAMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0151</NUMEX>) and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-km radius</NUMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00168</NUMEX>). The different catchment regions that we simulate (with
          radii of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km, 40 km</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km</NUMEX>) for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> are illustrated in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B‚Äì2D</TIMEX>. The
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> that have access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 86%</NUMEX> of the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> for the case of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-km</TIMEX>
          catchment region, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89%</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40-km</NUMEX> catchment region, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93%</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-km</NUMEX> catchment
          region.
        
        
          Modeling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distribution of Treatment</ENAMEX>
          To determine how many ARVs should be allocated to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>, we first calculate how a
          given supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> will be distributed from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> to the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in
          the catchment region. We calculate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúeffective demand‚Äù</ENAMEX> on HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>, D
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> , to be
          
          which sums the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúeffective demand‚Äù</ENAMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> on HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> (where there are 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>). Then, we model the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> to
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> within the catchment region as the proportion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúeffective demand‚Äù</ENAMEX> on
          HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> that is contributed by the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, ARVs
          will be distributed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX>, to each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as the ratio
          
          Therefore, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> treated in community 
          i by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> supply allocated to HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> is
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> is the number of regimes allocated to HCF 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> . Hence, the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treated in community 
          i,T
          i , summing over all 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n HCFs</ENAMEX> is
          
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equity Objective Function</ENAMEX>
          We establish an equity objective function to determine the optimal equitable
          allocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> so that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> have an equal chance of
          receiving treatment. To obtain the same fraction of treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, given that there are 
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> regimes for a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, the resulting
          objective function to minimize (based on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least</NUMEX> squares) becomes
          
          Our goal is to minimize 
          E, by solving for the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> to be allocated to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> (

          preceding analysis still holds and only the functional form of the objective function
          needs to be altered. To solve the problem, and determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>, we used successive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> programming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> research techniques [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Results
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KwaZulu‚</ENAMEX>ÄìNatal that we determined is complex (see Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A and 3B</TIMEX>).
        According to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> should be allocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Durban</ENAMEX>, and the
        remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> should be allocated to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HCFs</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Durban HCFs</ENAMEX> receiving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì15%</NUMEX> of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> and the remaining non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durban HCFs</ENAMEX> each
        receiving <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5%</NUMEX> of the total ARVs available). We note that our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX> does not produce
        perfect equality; however, our optimal strategy significantly improves equality in
        obtaining treatment over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other allocation strategies that we analyzed for
        comparison: (i) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> allocated only to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> (in the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durban</ENAMEX>) (see Figure 3D
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3E</ENAMEX>), and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) equal quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> allocated to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>
        (see Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3G and 3H</TIMEX>). For comparison of allocation strategies (in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) we used an
        effective catchment radius of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003786</NUMEX>). The proportion of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that are treated at
        each location is displayed graphically in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> for our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>) and the two
        comparison allocation strategies (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3F and 3I</TIMEX>). The best achievable outcome, given the
        limited treatment resources available, is that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> are treated in each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, yielding the map shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3F</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3I</ENAMEX>, but
        with dark blue/magenta over the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>. Whilst our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX> does not fully achieve
        this, it is considerably better than both of the comparison ARV allocation strategies.
        Furthermore, the equity objective function evaluates to 
        E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX> for our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>, compared with (i) 
        E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) 
        E = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133.88</NUMEX> for the comparison allocation strategies. There is large
        diversity in the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treated per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> when equal
        quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> are given to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>, evidenced by an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inter-quartile</NUMEX> range of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.025%‚Äì41.746%</NUMEX> compared with inter-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">quartile</ENAMEX> ranges of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì0% and 0.011%‚Äì9.982%</NUMEX> for the first
        comparison strategy and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>, respectively. Therefore, equal access is not obtained if
        equal quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> are allocated to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX>. Obviously, allocating to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> HCF
        (the first comparison strategy) could also be considered unequal because although the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-quartile range is minimal, effectively <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durban</ENAMEX>) receives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX>. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>, while not perfect, achieves the best equality possible given the accessibility
        constraints and limited ARV supply.
        The catchment region for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> is a factor of large uncertainty. We considered three
        catchment region sizes: radii of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km, 40 km</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km.</NUMEX> We also simulated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
        cases with increased numbers and locations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> as suggested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>'s
        official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> rollout operational plan [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]; and all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal</ENAMEX>). In
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> we present box plots of the percentage of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that obtain treatment
        per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> catchment region sizes we simulate.
        For each specified condition we calculate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEAS</ENAMEX>. It is apparent that equality in access
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> is improved substantially if the radius of each catchment region is increased
        and/or the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> is increased (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Our results show that the number of HCFs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">utilized</ENAMEX> is of greater importance than the size of the catchment region. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> HCFs are
        used, then even a (small) catchment radius of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> results in the ideal median proportion
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARVs</ENAMEX>. In the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88%</NUMEX> of
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> have access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-km</NUMEX> catchment region, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-km</TIMEX>
        catchment region, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-km</NUMEX> catchment region. In the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> have access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-km</NUMEX> catchment region, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX> for a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-km</TIMEX> catchment region, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-km</NUMEX> catchment region. Therefore, increasing the
        number of HCFs available for an ARV rollout is effective in significantly increasing
        equality in treatment accessibility as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Furthermore, if catchment regions
        actually have a radius of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km</NUMEX>, or can be increased to this size through improvements in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, this would enable access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> for almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, as
        shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. The actual HCF allocations determined by our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and optimization for
        the cases of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 27</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> (and for all catchment sizes we consider) are presented as
        pie charts in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. It is clear from our analysis that the equality criterion, such
        that each individual with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal</ENAMEX> has an equal chance of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX>, can
        best be satisfied by utilizing all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARV</ENAMEX> distribution and ensuring that each HCF
        serves a catchment region of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km.</NUMEX>
      
      
        Discussion
        We have established an elegant and simple theoretical framework for determining an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equitable</ENAMEX> and rational allocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> in resource-constrained <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. To the
        best of our knowledge, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> analysis to address this very difficult problem.
        We determined that increasing the size of the catchment region of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> can improve
        access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> considerably for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. We suggest that studies be performed to
        collect data on the distance that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> are willing and able to travel for
        treatment. This will facilitate discussions of this important issue, which must be
        considered in the making of policy decisions. A database consisting of such information has
        been proposed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. In an effort to provide equal access to communities
        with relatively little access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> therapy, the concept of a mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> that would
        travel between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> to take health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and resources to the location of the
        demand is a new initiative in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Agwale</ENAMEX>, personal communication) that could also
        be considered in other regions.
        We calculated the optimal allocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> to available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HCFs</ENAMEX> so that all infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will have as close as possible to an equal chance of obtaining treatment. We
        have shown that increasing the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ARV</ENAMEX> distribution can improve
        equality of access to ARVs substantially. The current plan in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KwaZulu‚</ENAMEX>ÄìNatal is to use only
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 HCFs</TIMEX>. However, our results clearly show that in order to achieve an optimal equitable
        allocation strategy, all existing infrastructure (i.e., all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> HCFs) should be used. The
        strategy that we are advising may be fairly easy to accomplish at the policy level because
        the health-care infrastructure (specifically these HCFs) already exists, although
        consideration must be made for issues such as the training and transportation that is
        necessary, which may be costly. In contrast, increasing the size of catchment regions may
        be very difficult. Obviously, increasing both the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> and the size of the
        catchment region each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> would substantially increase equality of access to health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal.</ENAMEX>
        Future modeling studies could extend our work by not making the simplifying assumption
        that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have similar ease of travel over the same distance and by including
        weighting functions on distance impedance for different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> (based on the quality
        of the road infrastructure, for example, and the availability of transportation) (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> P.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. O. Kahn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. M. Blower</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). Here, we have shown how to calculate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimal</ENAMEX> ARV allocation strategies based upon the principle of equity. Future research is
        necessary to compare ARV allocation strategies based upon the principle of efficiency
        (i.e., allocating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> to maximize epidemic reduction) in order to determine whether
        utilizing different principles for optimization would result in similar (or different)
        allocation strategies.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint United Nations Programme</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> have
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> core principles that should underlie the effort to fairly distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX>,
        namely: urgency, equity, and sustainability [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. They state that policy decisions for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> should be based upon the following ethical principles: (i) the
        principle that like cases should be treated alike, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the utilitarian principles of
        maximizing overall societal benefits, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) the egalitarian principles of equity
        (distributing resources, such as health care, equally among different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>), and (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) the
        Maximin principle (which prioritizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that are the least advantaged) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Here,
        we investigated the level of decision-making associated with allocating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX>, and
        we have applied the egalitarian principle of equity with respect to access to health care.
        We suggest that allocating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFs</ENAMEX> to achieve equality in accessibility could be
        carried out, and then individual-level ethical considerations could be thought out at the
        next level of deliberation. Future research is necessary to identify alternative (and more
        detailed) ethical ARV allocation strategies.
        Although we have focused on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> equitable strategy, there are many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> allocation
        strategies that are ethical. Uneven access to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment has the very real potential to
        fracture social and political structures and could lead to intrastate and/or interstate
        conflict [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Government decisions on ARV allocation have potentially socially
        destabilizing ramifications because essentially the decisions determine who lives and who
        dies. Resource allocation decisions will have to be made at a number of levels: it must be
        decided what proportion of the available <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> should be allocated to each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>; then it
        must be decided how many ARVs should be allocated to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCF</ENAMEX> within each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>; and
        finally, particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may be chosen to have treatment priority.
        Treatment priority decisions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> could be based on many different criteria,
        including disease progression (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts and viral load), socioeconomic status,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ethnicity</ENAMEX>, and who is thought to have the greatest risk of transmitting infections (for
        example, pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> or female sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>). Although it could be argued that
        behavioral core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> should be targeted to receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> because this may have the
        greatest epidemiological impact, such an allocation strategy would be neither feasible nor
        practical to implement. For example, sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are an obvious behavioral core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> would likely claim to be sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> if they knew that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> were only available
        to sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. Additionally, the ethics of targeting such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in favor of other
        societal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> must be questioned. It could also be argued that, to maximize the
        preventative effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> therapy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> should be concentrated in virological core groups
        (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with the highest viral load) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,26</NUMEX>]; this novel approach of targeting the
        virological core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has recently been proposed for controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HSV-2</ENAMEX> epidemics [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        Identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the virological core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would be far easier than identifying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the behavioral core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are likely to be the sickest
        and those with evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-related symptoms. Treatment allocation strategies could
        also be designed based on reducing the future epidemic impact and disregarding treatment
        equality amongst currently infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Such strategies place different social value on
        currently infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in comparison with future infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; such strategies
        therefore may not be ethical even though they may be epidemiologically sound (also, it is
        important to note that any epidemic predictions have large uncertainty ranges [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28,29</NUMEX>]).
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has been applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal</ENAMEX>, but it can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> by government health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in any resource-constrained <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In many of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> worst affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV pandemic</ENAMEX>, scarcity of resources will mean that not
        everyone that could potentially benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> will be able to access them. Many of the
        decisions that must be made to develop an effective response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic are
        inevitably underpinned by ethical considerations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leadership</ENAMEX> in most resource-constrained
        regions cannot avoid these decisions. Whilst there has been considerable attention given to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> worldwide either have plans in place (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX>) or are in the process of developing national programs for ARV
        distribution through the public health system (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mozambique</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        Legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> must come to their own consensus on the priorities
        and objectives of an ARV rollout, which is not a trivial matter [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,30</NUMEX>]. Our objective
        function and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be used to calculate allocation strategies that provide equity in
        access (compensating for geographical isolation), but if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in a given nation
        prioritize a different goal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> rollout, then an objective function to optimize can be
        formulated to reflect the specific national policy goal. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can be used by policy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to determine an optimal scientifically based allocation strategy, based upon the
        specific objective function. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARV</ENAMEX> rollout commences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KwaZulu‚ÄìNatal</ENAMEX>, difficult
        decisions will have to be made as to how to allocate scarce resources. We have shown that
        it is possible to obtain a mathematical solution to an equity problem. We suggest that our
        novel approach could be used to determine optimal equitable allocation strategies for many
        other resource-constrained <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that are just beginning to receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVs</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
