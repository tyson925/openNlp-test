        untiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> for justice for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, addressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Assembly</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. His speech characterized the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major phases of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic. After the initial silent spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> came the outbreak of ill
        health. The final stage, he said‚Äîthe stage of social impact‚Äîis marked by stigma, grinding
        down its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> with shame and isolation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>'s tragically short life was devoted to protecting all who stood to be diminished by
        illness-related stigma and the erosion of elemental human rights [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Why were stigma and
        human rights so essential to the work of a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> fighting an infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>?
      
      
        Fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stigma Fuels the HIV Epidemic</ENAMEX>
        Stigma is of utmost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> because it is both the cause and effect of secrecy and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">denial</ENAMEX>, which are both catalysts for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV transmission</ENAMEX>. Fear of stigma limits the efficacy
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-testing programs across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sub-Saharan Africa</ENAMEX>, because in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> everyone
        knows‚Äîsooner or later‚Äîwho visits test sites [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>]. While in some places the advent of free
        and accessible antiretroviral therapy has offered hope and encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to go for
        testing, [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] stigma remains a barrier to testing even where treatment is available [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> testing, an essential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step to treatment, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> may go by while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
        are infected transmit the virus to others. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> finally become ill and seek
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, treatment as a prevention strategy has lost much of its potential effectiveness.
        Fear of stigma can cause pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> testing, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in reducing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-to-child transmission [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7‚Äì9</NUMEX>]. It may force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to expose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection
        through breast-feeding because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> do not want to arouse suspicion of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        status by using alternative feeding methods [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11</NUMEX>]. Fear of stigma, and the resulting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">denial</ENAMEX>, may even inhibit condom use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX>. Further evidence of how
        stigma leads to denial is the way in which newspaper obituaries avoid mentioning <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
        as a cause of death.
        HIV-related stigma directly hurts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who lose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> support due to their real
        or supposed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> may be isolated within their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, hidden away
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, or made to eat alone [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. These repercussions may or may not be simple acts
        of heartlessness. They may be a well-intentioned but ignorant attempt to preserve the
        family. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may be sanctioned because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> is ill; in
        an impoverished society with no safety net of public services, this can be ominous for
        everyone [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        In many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, an individual's, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s, life is closely intertwined
        with others. The same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have lived closely together for several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, and there
        are few secrets. Inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, caregivers may be largely concerned about contracting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        through casual contact, and outside they fear the gossip that can greatly affect everyone's
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> standing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neighbors</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, for instance, may refuse to purchase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> from someone associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, this
        can devastate a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s chances of economic survival.
        The language used to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> (such as ‚Äúshe is an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äù ‚Äúhe</ENAMEX> is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">walking corpse‚Äù</ENAMEX>) clearly conveys stigmatizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX>. A particularly powerful example of
        stigmatizing language is found in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX>, where an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is called
        
        nyambizi , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX>, implying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is
        stealthy, menacing, and deadly [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,13</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> can also experience a form of internalized stigma (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Even without the burden of externally imposed social opprobrium, those living with a
        serious illness can face an enormous and painful inner struggle. They may eventually cease
        to be who they were, instead becoming a unitary ‚Äúperson with an illness‚Äù or‚Äîmore damning‚Äîan
        ‚Äúill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a thing in which personhood and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> have completely fused. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">philosopher Simone Weil</ENAMEX> characterized this assault of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> upon the self with the
        classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> notion of the soul‚Äî
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malheur</ENAMEX> (affliction) stamps the soul to its very depths with scorn and
        disgust [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        The combination of external stigma and internal oppression of the self may impose a
        heavy burden. In our experience of working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, the result of
        this burden is often a downward spiral marked by fatalism, self-loathing, and isolation
        from others. And by shaming and silencing the very <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who could credibly speak for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevention</ENAMEX> and provide care for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive others, stigma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> epidemic,
        consigning more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to suffering and death.
      
      
        Stigma in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>
        Stigma is part of the attitudes and social structures that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">set people</ENAMEX> against each
        other. It impedes any countervailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for social equality. Certainly since Erving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goffman</ENAMEX>'s seminal work on stigma in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, stigma (plural stigmata) has been
        recognized as ‚Äúan attribute that is significantly discrediting,‚Äù and it is known as a
        potent and painful force in individual lives [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Fueled by prejudice and appealing to it,
        stigma functions to diminish the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> being targeted. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> since
        Goffman have particularly examined stigma's broader social functioning. They have noted
        that while subordinating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in society, the stigmatizing process also
        reinforces hierarchical patterns of privilege, where those at the top of a stratified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> are pre-eminent over, and sometimes predatory upon, others at lower levels
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        To see this perhaps more clearly, think of certain religious settings where punishment
        theories of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> causation are in force [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17‚Äì19</NUMEX>]. One such outlook presumes an aroused
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deity</ENAMEX> or ancestor bringing illness upon a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in retribution for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offense</ENAMEX>. This notion
        stigmatizes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> struggling with their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. It blames their sickness upon
        misbehaviors, while at the same time it rationalizes privileging the well over the ill.
        Punishment theories authorize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> to isolate or purge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúimpure‚Äù‚Äîpeople</ENAMEX> whose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">imagined ‚Äúsinfulness‚Äù</ENAMEX> would contaminate the whole‚Äîwhile reassuring that virtue
        and social status will protect the righteous.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Clergy</ENAMEX> and other religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are as susceptible as any to the temptation to
        exercise power over others. This imbalance of power is facilitated by such structured
        inequalities within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> as the preeminence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">laity</TIMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        and even by the presumed superiority of the more ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù over the less so. Under the
        influence of western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> still promote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evangelical formulae in which</ENAMEX>, it is taught, creation was originally good, but then the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúfall‚Äù</ENAMEX> of humankind occurred, which is bad, and finally, redemption is available only for
        the chosen. This theological approach warrants valorizing or stigmatizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúsaved‚Äù
        or ‚Äúsinner,<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äù ‚Äúpure‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúimpure,‚Äù ‚Äúus‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthem,‚Äù and it strengthens the broader social
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stratifications</ENAMEX> within which stigma flourishes. What is weakened is the opportunity to
        apply healing insights from the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> legacy of compassion, liberation, and hope
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Gender and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        In much of sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are a subordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who are expected to become
        pregnant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bear children</ENAMEX>, and fulfill the sexual desires of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> without
        hesitation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Such traditional assumptions, sometimes reinforced by the missionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">religions</ENAMEX>, greatly benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> while predisposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. Often husbands
        carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>, while barrier methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> prevention, such as condoms, are proscribed,
        perhaps most vigorously by male-dominant religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s subordinate status in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, they are also frequently
        stigmatized as the vectors of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission, despite overwhelming evidence to the
        contrary. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, the term for a sexually transmitted <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, regardless of its origin,
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúwoman's disease</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Husbands</ENAMEX> have beaten and/or abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> thought to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive, despite the fact that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> contract the virus from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>. Some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are subject to violence if they refuse a sexual overture, ask their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> to use a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">condom</ENAMEX>, or request an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> test. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> should die, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s in-laws may seize her
        inheritance [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> exhibiting the independence needed to protect her health and
        self-esteem risks the disapprobation of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> are the clear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> of this arrangement in both social and economic terms, and
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widows</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, dispossessed or not, struggle against enormous odds simply
        to survive. Public attitudes, stigma among them, help to sustain the entire unjust
        system.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stigma and Human Rights</ENAMEX>
        We marvel at the prescience and lucidity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> who was dedicated to treating
        the whole person‚Äîboth the physical ills and the emotional distress attendant upon these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ills</ENAMEX>, including the stigma inherited from or imposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> where the oppression of
        some fortifies the privilege of others. Mann respected the healing potential of social
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> in general, and of human rights in particular. He knew that a society in which
        multiple injustices routinely occur is itself not well, and he knew that widespread respect
        of human rights made less room for stigma and its harmful consequences.
        
          Respect of human rights makes less room for stigma
        
        The way to tackle social oppression of any kind is to introduce strategies that address
        underlying conditions of poverty, racism, and sexism that support such oppression [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. This
        approach should be bolstered by sufficient legal and policy mechanisms to protect people
        subject to stigma and the erosion of human rights in general [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,23</NUMEX>]. The same mechanisms
        should be functional and accessible to all.
        To be effective, all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV interventions</ENAMEX> should include an analysis of how stigma
        functions, how it enhances dominance and subordination in society, how it is that some win
        and others lose in the pernicious struggle for pre-eminence, and why it is that such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> scheme perversely flourishes in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Enlightened HIV</ENAMEX> prevention and care interventions (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) will empower the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stigmatized</ENAMEX> through health education that lifts self-blame and shifts opprobrium to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX>, self-serving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. While teaching respect for all through a more just society,
        these interventions will help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are stigmatized to critique unjust societal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> and challenge assumptions and warrants of privilege.
        A tall order? Maybe, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX> asked all of us‚Äîthose struggling with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and the
        presumably healthy‚Äîto make societies as healthy as their individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
