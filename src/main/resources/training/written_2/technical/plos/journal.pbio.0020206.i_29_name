        a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> full of spare parts. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Innovation</ENAMEX> (like homicide) requires motive and
        opportunity. Clearly, the predominant ‘motive’ during the evolution of a novel gene
        function is to gain a selective advantage. To understand why gene duplications represent
        the major ‘opportunities’ from which new genes evolve, we must first consider what
        constrains genic evolution.
        The vast majority of genes in every genome are selectively constrained, in that most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> changes that alter the fitness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> are deleterious. How do we know
        this? Comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> clearly demonstrate that coding sequences diverge at
        slower rates than non-coding regions, largely due to a deficit of mutations at positions
        where a base change would cause an amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> change. Gene duplication provides
        opportunities to explore this forbidden evolutionary space more widely by generating
        duplicates of a gene that can ‘wander’ more freely, on condition that between them they
        continue to supply the original function.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susumu Ohno</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to comprehensively elucidate the potential of gene
        duplication, in his book 
        Evolution by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Duplication</ENAMEX> , published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 30 years ago</TIMEX> (Ohno
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>). The prescience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohno</ENAMEX>'s book is highlighted by the fact that his book has almost
        certainly been cited more times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first five years</TIMEX> after
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is the Evidence for the Importance</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Duplication</ENAMEX>?
        The primary evidence that duplication has played a vital role in the evolution of new
        gene functions is the widespread existence of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that
        share a common ancestor as a result of a duplication event are denoted as being paralogous,
        distinguishing them from orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in different genomes, which share a common
        ancestor as a result of a speciation event. Paralogous genes can often be found clustered
        within a genome, although dispersed paralogues, often with more diverse functions, are also
        common.
        Whole genome sequences of closely related organisms have allowed us to identify changes
        in the gene complements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> over relatively short evolutionary distances. These
        comparisons typically reveal dramatic expansions and contractions of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that can
        be related to underlying biological differences. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> differ in
        their sensory reliance on sight and smell respectively; colour vision in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> has been
        significantly enhanced by the duplication of an Opsin gene that allows us to distinguish
        light at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different wavelengths, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> can distinguish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>. By contrast, a
        much higher proportion of the large gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptors</ENAMEX> have retained their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functionality</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
        Given the apparent importance of gene duplication for the evolution of new biological
        functions over all evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">timescales</ENAMEX>, it is of great interest to be able to
        comprehensively document the duplicative differences that exist between our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
        our closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, the great apes. The study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortna et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> identifies <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 3%</NUMEX> of around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as having
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">undergone</ENAMEX> lineage-specific copy number changes among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hominoid (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> plus the great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apes</ENAMEX>) species. This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that copy number changes among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apes</ENAMEX> have been assayed
        for the vast majority of human genes, and we can expect that the biological consequences of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> human-specific copy number changes identified in this study will be heavily
        investigated over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX>.
      
      
        How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Do Duplications Arise</ENAMEX>?
        The various mechanisms by which genes become duplicated are often classified on the
        basis of the size of duplication generated, and whether they involve an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> intermediate
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‘Retrotransposition’</ENAMEX> describes the integration of reverse transcribed mature RNAs at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> sites in a genome. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resultant duplicated genes</ENAMEX> (retrogenes) lack introns and have
        poly-A tails. Separated from their regulatory elements, these integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> rarely
        give rise to expressed full-length coding sequences, although functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retrogenes</ENAMEX> have
        been identified in most genomes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> duplication of a genomic segment (segmental duplication) is one of the possible
        outcomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‘unequal crossing over’</ENAMEX>, which results from homologous recombination between
        paralogous sequences. These recombination events can also give rise to the deletion or
        inversion of intervening sequences. Recent evidence suggests that the explosion of
        segmental duplications in recent primate evolution has been caused in part by the rapid
        proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> elements <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 40 MYA</TIMEX>. Alu <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">7SL RNA gene</ENAMEX>
        and represent the most frequent dispersed repeat in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, with the
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 million</TIMEX> copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300-bp Alu</ENAMEX> element representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 10%</NUMEX> of the
        entire genome. The striking enrichment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> at the junctions between duplicated
        and single copy sequences implicates unequal crossing over between these repeats in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of segmental duplications (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailey et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>).
        The observation of segmental duplication events with no evidence for homology-driven
        unequal crossing over suggests that segmental duplications can also arise through
        non-homologous mechanisms. A recent screen for spontaneous duplications in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> suggests
        that replication-dependent chromosome breakages also play a significant role in generating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> duplications, because duplication breakpoints are enriched at replication
        termination sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koszul et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        Genome duplication events generate a duplicate for every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in the genome,
        representing a huge opportunity for a step-change in organismal complexity. However, genome
        duplication presents significant problems for the faithful transmission of a genome from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to the next, and is consequently a rare event, at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Metazoa</ENAMEX>. In
        principle, genome duplications should be easily identified through the coincident emergence
        within a phylogeny of many gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, this signal is complicated by
        subsequent piecemeal loss and gain of gene family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Consequently, there is heated
        debate over possible ancient genome duplication events in early vertebrate evolution and
        more recently in teleost <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, both of which must have occurred <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLysaght et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Peer et al. 2003).</ENAMEX>
        So what are the relative contributions of these different mechanisms? Not all
        interspersed duplicate genes are generated by retrotransposition. The initially tandem
        arrangement of segmental duplications can be broken up by subsequent rearrangements. In
        keeping with this hypothesis, duplicated genes in a tandem arrangement typically represent
        more recent duplication events (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friedman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hughes 2003).</ENAMEX> Recent analyses suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
        of non-functional duplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (pseudogenes) in the human genome result from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposition</ENAMEX> rather than any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based process (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torrents et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>).
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fates Befall a Recently Duplicated Gene</ENAMEX>?
        A duplicated gene newly arisen in a single genome must overcome substantial hurdles
        before it can be observed in evolutionary comparisons. First, it must become fixed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, it must be preserved over time. Population genetics tells us that
        for new alleles, fixation is a rare event, even for new mutations that confer an immediate
        selective advantage. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that one in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicated</ENAMEX> and fixed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every million years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Conery 2000</ENAMEX>), although it should be
        clear from the duplication mechanisms described above that it is highly unlikely that
        duplication rates are constant over time. However, once fixed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible fates are
        typically envisaged for our gene duplication.
        Despite the slackened selective constraints, mutations can still destroy the incipient
        functionality of a duplicated gene: for example, by introducing a premature stop codon or a
        mutation that destroys the structure of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domain. These degenerative
        mutations result in the creation of a pseudogene (nonfunctionalization). Over time, the
        likelihood of such a mutation being introduced increases. Recent studies suggest that there
        is a relatively narrow time window for evolutionary exploration before degradation becomes
        the most likely outcome, typically of the order of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch</ENAMEX> and Conery
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
        During the relatively brief period of relaxed selection following gene duplication, a
        new, advantageous allele may arise as a result of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the gene copies gaining a new
        function (neofunctionalization). This can be revealed by an accelerated rate of amino-acid
        change after duplication in one of the gene copies. This burst of selection is necessarily
        episodic—once a new function is attained by one of the duplicates, selective constraints on
        this gene are reasserted. These patterns of selection can be observed in real data: most
        recently duplicated gene pairs in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> have diverged at different rates from
        their ancestral amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> A convincing instance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neofunctionalization</ENAMEX> is the evolution of antibacterial activity in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ECP gene</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old World Monkeys</ENAMEX> and hominoids after a burst of amino-acid
        changes following the tandem duplication of the progenitor gene 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDN</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a ribonuclease</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang et al. 1998).</ENAMEX> The divergence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplicated genes</ENAMEX> over time can be also monitored in genome-wide functional studies. In both
        yeast and nematodes, the ability of a gene to buffer the loss of its duplicate declines
        over time as their functional overlap decreases.
        Rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gene duplicate retaining the original function, while the other either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degrades</ENAMEX> or evolves a new function, the original functions of the single-copy gene may be
        partitioned between the duplicates (subfunctionalization). Many genes perform a
        multiplicity of subtly distinct functions, and selective pressures have resulted in a
        compromise between optimal sequences for each role. Partitioning these functions between
        the duplicates may increase the fitness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> by removing the conflict between
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more functions. This outcome has become associated with a population genetic model
        known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duplication–Degeneration–Complementation</ENAMEX> (DDC) model, which focuses attention
        on the regulatory changes after duplication (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>,
        degenerative changes occur in regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> of both duplicates, such that these
        changes complement each other, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of the expression patterns of the two
        duplicates reconstitutes the expression pattern of the original (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        A recent study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorus et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) investigated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposition</ENAMEX> (since the existence of a human–mouse common ancestor) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">autosomal</ENAMEX> copies of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDYL</ENAMEX> gene to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> chromosome (forming 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDY</ENAMEX> ). In the mouse, both 
        Cdyl genes produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct transcripts, one of which is expressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ubiquitously</ENAMEX> while the other is testis-specific. By contrast, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> both 
        CDYL genes produce a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitously</ENAMEX> expressed transcript, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDY</ENAMEX> exhibits testis-specific expression. As 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDY</ENAMEX> is a retrogene (see above) that has not been duplicated together with
        its ancestral regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>, it is clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is not the only route by
        which to achieve spatial partitioning of ancestral expression patterns.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subfunctionalization</ENAMEX> can also lead to the partitioning of temporal as well as spatial
        expression patterns. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the β-globin cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplicated genes</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX>
        genes with coordinated but distinct developmental expression patterns. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> gene is
        expressed in embryos, another in foetuses, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> from neonates onwards. In
        addition, coding sequence changes have co-evolved with the regulatory changes so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> binding affinity of haemoglobin is optimised for each developmental
        stage. This coupling between coding and regulatory change is similarly noted at a genomic
        level when expression differences between many duplicated genes pairs are correlated with
        their coding sequence divergence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Makova</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li 2003).</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Evolutionary Consequences</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Duplication</ENAMEX>
        If duplication results in the formation of a novel function as a result of interaction
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> diverged duplicates, which of the above categories of evolutionary outcome
        does this innovation fall into? Not all new biological functions resulting from gene
        duplications can be ascribed to individual genes. Protein–protein interactions often occur
        between diverged gene duplicates. This is especially true for ligand–receptor pairs, which
        are often supposed to coevolve after a gene duplication event, and thus progress from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homophilic</ENAMEX> to heterophilic interactions. This emergent function of the new gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> does
        not fit comfortably into any of the scenarios outlined above: both genes are functional yet
        neither retains the original function, nor has the original function been partitioned. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode of ‘duplicate</ENAMEX> co-evolution’ is likely to be especially prevalent in signalling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>.
        Earlier, we saw that homologous recombination between paralogous sequences can result in
        rearrangements, including tandem duplications. Such recombination events need not cause
        rearrangements, but can also result in the nonreciprocal transfer of sequence from one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogue</ENAMEX> to the other—a process known as gene conversion. Gene conversion homogenizes
        paralogous sequences, retarding their divergence, and consequently obscuring their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiquity</ENAMEX>. This leads to the observation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‘concerted evolution’ whereby duplicates</ENAMEX> within
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> can be highly similar and yet continue to diverge between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Once gene duplicates have diverged sufficiently so that they differ in their functionality
        (or non-functionality), gene conversion events can become deleterious—for example, by
        introducing disrupting mutations from a pseudogene into its functional duplicate. A
        substantial proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> alleles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaucher</ENAMEX> disease result from the introduction
        of mutations into the glucocerebrosidase gene from a tandemly repeated pseudogene (Tayebi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2003</ENAMEX>). These kinds of recombinatorial interactions only occur between paralogues
        that are minimally diverged. Thus, while selective interactions and functional overlap
        between duplicates declines relatively slowly over evolutionary time, the potential for
        recombinatorial interactions between paralogues is relatively short-lived.
        For some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, duplication confers an immediate selective advantage by facilitating
        elevated expression, or as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohno</ENAMEX> put it, ‘duplication for the sake of producing more of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">same’.</ENAMEX> This has clearly been the case for histones and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA genes</ENAMEX>. In this
        scenario, gene conversion is of potential benefit in maintaining homogeneity between
        copies. Certainly both histone and rDNA genes are commonly found in arrays of duplicates:
        structures that facilitate array homogenization by both gene conversion and repeated
        unequal crossing over.
        Mechanisms of segmental duplication are oblivious to where genes begin and end, and so
        are additionally capable of duplicating parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or several contiguous genes. The
        intragenic duplication of individual exons or enhancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> also presents new
        opportunities for the evolution of new functions or greater regulatory complexity.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The likelihood that newly duplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will both remain functional clearly relates
        to their inherent potential to undergo subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. Under
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, greater regulatory complexity bestows greater potential for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfunctionalization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), whereas neofunctionalization is more likely to
        occur in genes that are necessarily rapidly evolving, such as those involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX>, immunity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> defence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emes et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). This is not to say that these
        biases are deterministic, there are plenty of ‘successful’ gene family clusters that
        contain associated pseudogenes.
        Duplicate gene evolution has most likely played a substantial role in both the rapid
        changes in organismal complexity apparent in deep evolutionary splits and the
        diversification of more closely related species. The rapid growth in the number of
        available genome sequences presents diverse opportunities to address important outstanding
        questions in duplicate gene evolution. For those interested in patterns of selection
        following duplication, the transient nature of the evolutionary window of opportunity
        following duplication will focus attention on recently duplicated genes. In this regard it
        will be important to document copy number variation not only among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortna et</ENAMEX>
        al. have, but within species as well. In addition, it has been, and will continue to be, a
        lot easier to identify copy number changes between genomes than it is to identify their
        biological consequences (if any). Extensive functional studies targeted at duplicated genes
        are required if we are to more fully understand the range of evolutionary outcomes.
        Moreover, collaborations between the proteomics and evolutionary genetics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> would
        facilitate investigation of the potential role of gene duplication during the evolution of
        the protein–protein and cell–cell interactions that are fundamental to the biology of
        multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
