        genomes, and the information that has poured out of these sequences is quite astonishing.
        With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150</NUMEX> complete genome sequences now available and many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> rushing
        into microarray analysis, proteomic initiatives, and even systems biology, it seems an
        appropriate time to consider not just the opportunities those sequences present, but also
        their shortcomings. By far the most serious problem is the quality and degree of
        completeness of the annotation of those genomes. Most troublesome are the large numbers of
        open reading frames that have been identified by computer programs, but remain labeled as a
        “conserved hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">protein”</ENAMEX> when they occur in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> genome or simply a
        “hypothetical protein” when they appear unique to the genome in question. Between them,
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories of annotated open reading frames often represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of the
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding regions of a genome.
        These annotations highlight just one portion of our ignorance about the information
        content of genomes and our lack of fundamental knowledge about the function of so many of
        the building blocks of cells. Unless we rectify this situation, it is likely to undermine
        many of the other “-omic” efforts currently underway. Here I advocate a rather
        straightforward approach to address this problem—focused initially on the bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. In contrast to the numerous proposals for big science initiatives to understand
        the fundamental workings of biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, I propose a small science, relatively
        low-tech approach that could have a dramatic pay off. A relatively small investment could
        yield a massive amount of information that would greatly enhance our current efforts to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomic</ENAMEX> approaches to study life.
      
      
        Initial Proposal
        The initial proposal is directed at deciphering the role of the “hypothetical proteins”
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in the microbial genomes and would involve a community-wide approach to determine
        the function of these hypotheticals based on solid, old-fashioned biochemistry. The essence
        of the idea is to undertake an interdisciplinary effort that couples our current
        bioinformatics capabilities to predict protein function with a directed exploration by
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> to test those predictions. I would encourage a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bioinformaticians</ENAMEX> to produce a list of all of the conserved hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are
        found in multiple genomes, to carry out the best possible bioinformatics analysis, and then
        to offer those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to the biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for research into
        their function. To energize <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> with appropriate expertise to participate in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>-wide effort, I suggest that a special program be set up by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> undertaking the investigation of any particular
        protein receive a small grant upfront as a supplement to an existing grant. Upon completion
        of the project and the identification of the function, they would receive a further
        supplement to that grant as a reward. In this way, one might hope to rally some of the best
        biochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> and apply it to this problem of determining function for a wide range of
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The cost of such an operation could be quite minimal, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> and
        review process could be equally simple. Here is a case where a modest infusion of funds
        could greatly enhance our ability to annotate both existing and new genome sequences and
        ensure that our current investments in genomic sequences yield the richest biological
        harvest possible. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key steps in the proposed plan.
      
      
        Key Steps
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step is to encourage some bioinformaticians with appropriate expertise in the
        functional annotation of genomes to form a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> and undertake the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of a list
        of prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for which an experimental demonstration of function would be most
        valuable. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> come to mind: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The conserved hypothetical
        genes. These belong to the set of genes that have orthologs in many other genomes, but for
        which no function has been experimentally determined in any case. A recent success among
        such genes is illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) The hypothetical genes. These form the set of genes
        that are predicted to be protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coding</ENAMEX>, but that lack similar genes in any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>. They, too, have no assigned function. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) The misannotated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. These genes
        are ones for which a function has been assigned, but for which there is a good reason to
        believe the annotation is incorrect.
        These sets of targets would be combined and arranged into a prioritized list in which
        each was accompanied by the best assessment of potential function. The priorities would be
        based on which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were most likely to prove broadly informative. For instance, a
        conserved hypothetical gene that occurred in most genomes would be of higher priority than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> orthologs. The list would be on a public Web site where these targets
        and the predicted functions could be examined and modified by alternative or additional
        predictions from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to guide future experimentation. As function was derived,
        that information could be presented and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> removed from the main list.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step would be to invite experimentalists to peruse the list and find those
        potential genes whose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> might lie within their realm of expertise so that
        they could use their experimental knowledge and reagents to quickly test for function.
        Initially, I would advocate allowing laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to pick and choose among the list and
        sign up to study just one of these open reading frames. I would recommend allowing one
        laboratory per open reading frame in the initial stages. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> wishing to sign up
        would generate a short document highlighting why its expertise might be suitable for a
        particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-page proposal should suffice, with no experimental plan demanded.
        At this point, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> could choose among competing efforts and the laboratory chosen
        would be given a small grant and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to six months</TIMEX> to carry out its analysis. If it was
        successful in delineating the function of their target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> would be written
        and submitted for peer review. If the paper was accepted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, then an
        additional sum would be allocated as a supplement to the laboratory's existing grant. If,
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> had not managed to delineate the function, it would submit a
        short report describing the approaches that have been tried, with the results of its
        analyses. This would be posted on the public Web site and that target would then become
        open for analysis by other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, under the same conditions as before.
        While the initial list of target genes should probably be based on a well-studied and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">experimentally tractable organism</ENAMEX> such as 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> , I would not demand that the biochemical
        experiments be done on the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene</ENAMEX>. Any of the orthologs would do, so long as the
        similarity was sufficiently strong to give high expectations that function would be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. In fact, for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> that happened to be already working on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
        homologs, this program might provide an added bonus and greatly speed its work. I would
        also encourage both biochemical and genetic approaches, since one can never be certain when
        one method might be better than another. The list would, of course, also include conserved
        genes not found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> , but commonly distributed in other genomes. In
        particular, I would make a pitch for including all genes in 
        Mycoplasma genitalium , which, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> with
        the fewest genes, might be the most suitable as a model system for in-depth understanding
        of its biology.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Importance of Community</ENAMEX>
        This proposal for experimental attack on hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is really a very traditional
        approach that becomes large-scale simply because of the parallel nature of the
        implementation. It resembles the successful approach used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> to achieve the
        complete sequence of the 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goffeau et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). The
        results would significantly increase our functional knowledge of the genes within the
        microbial genomes thus far sequenced. Such annotation would be immediately applicable
        across orthologs and could dramatically improve the value of the sequenced genomes. This,
        in turn, would facilitate our ability to annotate new genomes as they appear. The proposal
        also reinforces the notion that the overwhelming value of bioinformatics is to generate
        hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. By enabling the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to join in this
        effort, we would also demonstrate that science really is the collaborative enterprise that
        requires all of our contributions, not just a select few. Finally, if this initiative
        succeeds, it would serve as a suitable model from which to begin the more daunting task of
        trying to annotate the functions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> eukaryotic genomes, such as the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.
