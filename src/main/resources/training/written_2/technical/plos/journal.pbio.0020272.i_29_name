        who know about such things, we live in a momentous time, the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sixth Mass</ENAMEX>
        Extinction! But most of us do not feel at all cursed. Because, in fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth</ENAMEX> is quite
        different to the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Big Fiveâ</ENAMEX>€”no-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would notice this one if we were not repeatedly
        reminded of it by ecologists. Previous mass extinctions were not so bashful, so discreet.
        The fossil record reveals the disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> during previous ones, replaced by an
        abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus spores</ENAMEX>, telling us of a world of devastated forests rotting away. The
        earliest sediments after the mass extinction that did away with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> are barren of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fossils</ENAMEX>: so it is not just that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were going extinct, conditions for life itself were
        bad. Not only did species diversity drop, the abundance of life did as well.
        But conditions for life itself have never been better than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. In the history of the
        planet, there has never been anything as productive of life as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> field in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>. It
        may not have a large diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but that is a different matter. In fact, one of
        the reasons for the ongoing loss of plant diversity from grasslands is the very reason the
        wheat field is so productiveâ€”fertilisation. We are pouring nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertiliser</ENAMEX> into the
        environment and, through the wellstudied â€˜paradox of enrichmentâ€™, this reduces species
        diversity while increasing actual biomass. Now, there is no question that if current trends
        of habitat alteration and climate change continue then we will ultimately lose large
        numbers of speciesâ€”diversity will dropâ€”but this does not necessarily translate into a loss
        of abundance of life, and that is a big difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and previous mass
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extinctions</ENAMEX>. Looking at specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> tells the same story. So, for example,
        many island <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species</ENAMEX> are threatened, like the kagu of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Caledonia</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        seabird <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, like puffins, are booming. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX> amphibian diversity is
        threatened, but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane toads</ENAMEX> are a pest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>. Introduced species pose a threat to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">diversityâ€”the â€˜McDonald-isationâ</ENAMEX>€™ of natureâ€”precisely because they achieve enormous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundances</ENAMEX>.
        Actually, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> mass extinctions may have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> very important thing in common: from the
        point of view of the vast bulk of life on the planet they are probably not mass extinctions
        at all. By any criterionâ€”number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or total biomassâ€”the vast majority of life
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is invisibleâ€”microbial. So, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 10%</NUMEX> of the living biomass on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX> consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> living deep in the oceans' sediments: it would take more than an
        asteroid impact to disturb them. And microbial life is extraordinarily robust: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> can
        be found living happily in pressurised water hotter than your boiling kettle, in
        concentrated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, and their spores can survive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in the rigours of
        outer space.
        In talks and lectures, the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oceanographer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paleontologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Jackson</ENAMEX>
        paints a vivid picture of what is currently happening to coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ecosystems</ENAMEX>, talking about
        a wall of slime emanating from populated areas and growing outwards inexorably towards the
        open oceans, replacing beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecologies</ENAMEX> like coral reef systems. What he means is that the
        visible life that we find attractive and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">usefulâ€”pretty fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>, and so onâ€”is being
        replaced by microbes in splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">profusion</ENAMEX>. It is taken completely for granted that this is
        disastrous. From a utilitarian point of view indeed it is disastrous, since we like eating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>, and don't like snorkling in slime. But from the point of view of life per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se</ENAMEX>, again things have never been better. Life is so abundant that in some places all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is completely used up. These are called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€˜dead zonesâ€™</ENAMEX>, but they are no
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜deadâ€™</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dead Sea</ENAMEX>, which is actually teeming with lifeâ€”just not <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. But,
        nonetheless, we consider what is occurring to be a disaster not just from a utilitarian
        point of view, but at some deeper level giving us an emotional reaction to the word
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜slimeâ€™â</ENAMEX>€”somehow it is just plain wrong.
        But this reflects nothing other than our evolutionary origins. Evolution has programmed
        us to be positively interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and to be repelled by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slimes</ENAMEX> and oozes, teeming with potentially harmful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX>. These emotional responses
        colour our view of ecology, for example, in a way that has no parallel in other sciences:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> do not just study particles that they find pretty. No ecologist wants to study
        the rich ecosystem that each of us carries around inside our gut, because evolution has
        programmed our brains to find bottom-related matters disgusting. I think it likely that
        naturalists from a different planet, silicon entities evolved under very different
        circumstances, would find tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests uninteresting</ENAMEX> (mainly primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> with
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">herbivory</ENAMEX> and mutualisms) and animal guts fascinating, with their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in which each node is manned by different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with wildly varying means of
        energy production.
        Our guts should be an ecological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>'s dream come true, ecological theatres that
        are replicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of times, which operate on a fast time scale and are easy to get
        to! (If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> are ecologists, this would explain why they always â€˜probeâ€™ their abductees.)
        Many natural experiments are going on all the time as antibiotics and probiotics are
        administered and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> find all sorts of different ways, voluntary or otherwise, to
        establish migration links between their gut ecologies. Microbiologists are increasingly
        interested in our guts from an ecological point of view but, unlike ecologists, they are
        used to faeces from their work in sewage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two thousand years ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero</ENAMEX> noted the creation of barren desert-like
        land in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> were felled for their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX>, providing the earliest
        record of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ecosystem â€˜serviceâ€™</ENAMEX> provided by forestsâ€”the stabilisation of soils. Other
        services provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biodiversity</ENAMEX> readily come to mind, like pollination and carrion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clean-up</ENAMEX>, and there may be many more. But perhaps the clearest example of an ecosystem
        service provided by biodiversity comes from our gut. Throughout our history, until very
        recently, we all had worms. In rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> we have quite happily eradicated them from
        our inner ecosystems with none of the handwringing we expend on rhinos. But it is
        increasingly believed that the loss of worms from our internal ecology is responsible for
        the upsurge in inflammatory bowel disorders such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Crohn's disease</ENAMEX> and colitis. In fact,
        there are clinical trials underway in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> testing the efficacy of worms as
        treatment for these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. The mechanism is clear: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> trigger <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of the immune
        system which down-regulates another, inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. Our immune system has evolved to
        expect a certain constellation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in our gut: in that context, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> provide an
        ecosystem service of balancing the immune system.
        Our perception of our impact on the planet as equivalent to a mass extinction simply
        reflects the evolutionary prism through which we view life. Of course, we may yet live up
        to our own publicity and pull off something apocalyptic like a runaway greenhouse that
        sterilises the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. But it is at least as likely that the microbial world, resentful at
        being either ignored or exterminated, will come up with something to consign us to a
        footnote in the history of life when it is ultimately written by the silicon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Spanish flu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SARS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> have just been early experiments.
