        treated. And it doesn't take an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> to know that a disease cannot be diagnosed if the
        required tools are unaffordable or impractical. The absence of early diagnosis and
        treatment is particularly problematic for infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, where the lack of early
        treatment or isolation can result in an epidemic.
        Given the technological requirements, diagnosis and monitoring of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection is
        problematic in resource-poor areas. The advent of rapid tests for diagnosing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection
        represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the solution. Less clear is how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection will be monitored, given the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts. A decrease in CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes‚Äîa critical immune cell infected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV‚</ENAMEX>Äîis one of the
        hallmarks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV disease</ENAMEX>, and CD4
        + cell number is a key factor in determining disease progression and
        monitoring treatment. The methods for determining CD4
        + cell numbers are technically complex, expensive, and not easily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transportable</ENAMEX>. These factors severely limit the ability to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV disease</ENAMEX> in locations
        where resources, training, and mobility are limited.
        Lymphocytes are characterized by cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers</ENAMEX>; thus, CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">+ lymphocytes</ENAMEX> express the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> marker on their surface. Antibody probes
        that specifically recognize this and other cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD8</ENAMEX>, which
        distinguishes that lymphocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from CD4
        + lymphocytes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD3</ENAMEX>, which is a marker for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes) are
        used to count and differentiate various cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. By labeling cells with
        fluorescently <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tagged antibodies</ENAMEX> that recognize one or more cell surface molecules, the
        relative and absolute numbers of specific cells can be determined by a technique called
        flow cytometry. The labeled cells are passed through the flow cytometer, where the
        fluorescent probes are activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lasers</ENAMEX> in a manner that can be read by specific
        detectors. The CD4
        + cell number is directly correlated with the resultant fluorescent
        intensity and other light scatter properties. The problem is that flow cytometry requires
        costly reagents and substantial technical expertise‚Äîfactors that limit its use in less
        developed areas.
        Taking advantage of advances in microfluidics, digital imaging, and cell analysis,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rodriguez</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> now report on a way to count CD4
        + cells in a relatively quick, easy, and affordable manner. Small
        volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> (an amount that could be obtained by a finger prick as opposed to drawing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from a vein) are labeled as in flow cytometry, but with far less of the expensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagents</ENAMEX>. Microfiltration allows the labeled CD4
        + cells to be captured and separated from red blood cells, another
        simplification relative to flow cytometry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> images of the labeled cells, obtained by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> fluorescence microscopy, are then analyzed by newly developed software that can
        distinguish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> labels, thus allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of absolute CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+</ENAMEX> counts, CD4
        + percentages, and CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ :</ENAMEX>CD8
        + lymphocyte ratios.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodriguez et al.</ENAMEX> found that this new method was less accurate than flow cytometry for
        determining absolute CD4
        + lymphocyte counts above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> cells/mm3 (levels that are typically not
        relevant for monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>). But the method was as accurate as flow
        cytometry at clinically relevant levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ cells for HIV-infected adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
        Although only a small number of pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were examined (and thus statistical
        significance could not be ascertained), the method appears to be also effective in
        determining CD4
        + lymphocyte percentages in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        The detection system used in the present report is a tabletop instrument that serves as
        a prototype for a fully portable handheld model, which is now under development. After some
        modest training, such a tool should allow a variety of health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in remote areas
        to accurately analyze the CD4
        + status of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (the basis for treatment decisions)
        locally. In an accompanying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perspective</ENAMEX> discussing this new tool (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOI</ENAMEX>:
        10.1371/journal.<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pmed.0020214</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zvi Bentwich</ENAMEX> argues that before it is ready for widespread
        use, several issues still need to be resolved, such as its final cost and its applicability
        to pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúDespite these reservations,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of this study
        should be commended for addressing an extremely important issue and developing this novel
        approach for counting CD4 in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
