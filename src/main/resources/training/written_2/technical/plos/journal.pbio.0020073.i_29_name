        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanotechnology</ENAMEX>. This lecture, presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Physical Society</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>, prompted intense discussion about the possibilities, or
        impossibilities, of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manipulating materials</ENAMEX> at the molecular level. Although at the time of
        his presentation, the manipulation of single molecules and single atoms seemed improbable,
        if not impossible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feynman</ENAMEX> challenged his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to consider a new field of physics, one
        in which individual molecules and atoms would be manipulated and controlled at the
        molecular level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feynman 1960).</ENAMEX>
        As an example of highly successful machines at the ‚Äúsmall scale,<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äù Feynman</ENAMEX> prompted his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> to consider the inherent properties of biological cells. He colorfully noted that
        although cells are ‚Äúvery tiny,‚Äù they are ‚Äúvery active, they manufacture various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>,
        they walk around, they wiggle, and they do all kinds of wonderful things on a very small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scale‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feynman 1960).</ENAMEX> Of course, many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwonderful things‚Äù</ENAMEX> that he was referring to
        are a result of the activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> within each cell.
        The field of nanotechnology has indeed emerged and blossomed since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lecture</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> from many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciplines</ENAMEX> are now taking a careful look at the protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúmachines‚Äù</ENAMEX> that power biological cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drexler 1986).</ENAMEX> These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmachines‚Äù</ENAMEX> are inherently
        nanoscale, ranging in width from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few nanometers</NUMEX> (nm) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20</NUMEX> nm, and have been
        carefully refined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of evolution.
        As a graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in molecular biology, I have been especially interested in
        creative approaches to bridging the fields of biology and nanotechnology. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and
        protein molecules possess a number of intrinsic characteristics that make them excellent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of dynamic nanostructures and nanodevices. Properties such as
        the site-specific molecular recognition among interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> molecules, the
        template-directed self assembly of complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA strands</ENAMEX>, and the mechanical properties
        of certain protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> have enabled bionanotechnologists to envision a molecular
        world built ‚Äúfrom the bottom up‚Äù using biological-based starting materials.
        In my own research, I have been very interested in investigating protein interactions
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> pathways on a genome-wide scale. In many ways, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein pathways</ENAMEX> are analogous
        to nanoscale ‚Äúassembly lines,‚Äù since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein pathways</ENAMEX> often involve a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        that act in successive order to yield a particular molecular ‚Äúproduct‚Äù or perform a
        particular molecular function. While these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúassembly lines‚</ENAMEX>Äù are commonplace
        within biological cells, they prompt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> interesting questions with respect to the field of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanotechnology</ENAMEX>. First, can we mimic these multicomponent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúassembly lines‚</ENAMEX>Äù on
        nanofabricated surfaces? And, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, can we tailor these ‚Äúnanoscale assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lines‚Äù</ENAMEX> to
        perform new and unique tasks?
        Nanomechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, such as the rotary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, have also
        generated much interest from a nanotechnology standpoint (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soong et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). These protein
        complexes enable highly controlled mechanical motion at the nanoscale and may some day lead
        to novel rotary machines that function as molecular motors for a variety of nanoscale
        applications.
        In order to fully exploit these nanoscale <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> machines, it is of prime importance to
        be able to position individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> at the nanoscale.
        Progress in this area has recently been reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yan et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), who developed a
        method to construct two-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> arrays using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-directed templates. Building
        on work pioneered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadrian Seeman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Seeman 2003</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yan et</ENAMEX> al. constructed two-dimensional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA ‚Äúnanogrids‚Äù</ENAMEX> by exploiting the pairing that occurs between complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> strands
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The two-dimensional DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nanogrid</ENAMEX> exhibits a repeating periodic structure
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>) due to the inherent qualities of the individual DNA tiles that make up the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanogrid</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). The distance between adjacent tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 19</NUMEX> nm
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 4.5</NUMEX> turns of the DNA double helix plus the diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA helices</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yan</ENAMEX> et al. utilized these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> nanogrids to assemble periodic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein nanoarrays</ENAMEX>. The DNA
        nanogrid, in this case, served as a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scaffold</ENAMEX> for the self assembly of protein
        molecules into ordered arrays. In order to control the location of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> assembly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yan et</ENAMEX>
        al. first tethered a covalently linked biotin moiety to the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of each DNA
        tile. The biotin was covalently linked to one of the DNA strands at the position
        corresponding to the center of the tile. This design resulted in a uniform array of
        biotinylated tiles, with each biotin moiety separated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 19 nm.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> then
        added streptavidin, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has a strong binding affinity for biotin, to form a
        periodic streptavidin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> array on top of the biotinylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA lattice</ENAMEX>. The resulting
        array represents the first periodic, self-assembled DNA lattice in which individual protein
        molecules are precisely positioned into a periodic array with nanometer dimensions.
        It is interesting to consider some of the applications of self-assembled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein arrays</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soong et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) demonstrated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> could be used to
        power the rotation of an inorganic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel ‚Äúnanopropeller</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù ATP</ENAMEX> synthase is a multisubunit
        protein complex with a domain that rotates about its membrane-bound axis during the natural
        hydrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> within a cell. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Soong et al.</ENAMEX> attached a nanoscale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">inorganic ‚Äúpropeller‚Äù</ENAMEX> to
        the rotary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalk</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> synthase, creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äúrotary biomolecular motor</ENAMEX>.‚Äù It is intriguing
        to consider the construction of an ordered array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">synthase</ENAMEX> driven nanomachines, each
        positioned precisely along a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA scaffold</ENAMEX>, similar to that described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yan et</ENAMEX> al. Such an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly</ENAMEX>, combined with proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äúnanogears‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han et al. 1997)</ENAMEX>, may <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> enable the
        construction of nanoscale variations of the traditional ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúgear-train‚Äù and ‚Äúrack-and-pinion‚</NUMEX>Äù
        gearing systems. Construction of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> may facilitate the design of machines that
        can transmit and transform rotary motion at the nanoscale.
        In addition to rotary biomolecular motors, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that undergo substantial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes in response to external stimuli might also find some interesting
        uses in nanoarrays. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubey et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) are working on methods to exploit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pH</ENAMEX> dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes of the hemagglutinin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to construct what they term
        viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein linear</ENAMEX> (VPL) motors. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> that undergo substantial conformational changes
        in response to environmental stimuli may facilitate the design of nanoscale machines that
        produce linear motion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drexler 1981)</ENAMEX>, as opposed to rotary motion. At neutral pH, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> polypeptide forms a compact structure composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Œ±-helices folded
        back onto each other. At low pH, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> undergoes a substantial conformational change, which results in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">single ‚Äúextended‚Äù helix.</ENAMEX> This conformational change results in a linear mechanical motion,
        with a linear movement of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 nm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubey et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). It would be interesting
        to investigate the applications of ordered arrays of dynamic VPL motors, since an array of
        such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äúhinge‚Äù structures</ENAMEX> may enable the coordinated linear movement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of tethered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macromolecules</ENAMEX> in a synchronous manner.
        The work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yan et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) has opened up exciting new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> in the field of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanotechnology</ENAMEX> and has provided the molecular framework for the construction of dynamic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based assemblies. It is foreseeable that variations of these same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> scaffolds
        will eventually be used for the design and construction of more complex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assemblies</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nanoscale ‚Äúassembly lines‚Äù</ENAMEX> or periodic arrays of dynamic motor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This work is important to me because it demonstrates not only that it is possible
        to create uniform arrays of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> biomolecules using biomolecular scaffolds, but the
        study also emphasizes the important role that molecular biology will undoubtedly play as
        the field of nanotechnology matures.
        As the field of nanotechnology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see many
        more nanotechnology applications utilizing biological macromolecules. Toward <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Feynman</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> lecture, he quipped, ‚ÄúWhat are the possibilities of small but
        movable machines? They may or may not be useful, but they surely would be fun to make.‚Äù
