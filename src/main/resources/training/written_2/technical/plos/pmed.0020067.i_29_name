        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Stoll</ENAMEX>, the distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Institute</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> who helped to
        establish human parasitology research in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, described the unique health impact
        of hookworm as follows [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]: 
        
          As it was when I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> saw it, so it is now, one of the most evil of infections. Not
          with dramatic pathology as are <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">filariasis</ENAMEX>, or schistosomiasis, but with damage silent and
          insidious. Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is being pushed back hookworm remains the great infection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>. In my view it outranks all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> infections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> combined…in its
          production, frequently unrealized, of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">misery</ENAMEX>, debility, and inefficiency in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tropics</ENAMEX>.
        
        Like many other global disease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> who witnessed dramatic reductions in malaria
        prevalence as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDT</ENAMEX> spraying during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoll</ENAMEX> did not anticipate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malaria</ENAMEX>'s imminent re-emergence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. However, he articulated with eloquence the
        magnitude of the disease burden resulting from hookworm infection. He further offered the
        silent and insidious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of hookworm as a partial explanation for its neglect by the
        global medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
        This neglect subsequently intensified during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1990s</ENAMEX> with the
        omission of hookworm from the list of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> covered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>'s
        Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programme for Research</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical</ENAMEX>
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hookworm</ENAMEX> has proven to be extremely difficult to eliminate or eradicate in areas of
          poverty and poor sanitation.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diseases</ENAMEX>, as well as from other global health initiatives. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last ten years</TIMEX>,
        however, there has been increasing recognition of the global health importance of hookworm.
        Today, new international efforts to control the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> of hookworm and other
        soil-transmitted helminth infections are in progress (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX>who.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">int/wormcontrol</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etiology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global Distribution</ENAMEX>
        Human hookworm infection is caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-feeding nematode parasites of the genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancylostoma</ENAMEX> and the species 
        Necator americanus . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> americanus is the predominant etiology of human hookworm
        infection, whereas 
        A. duodenale occurs in more scattered focal environments [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hookworms, together with the roundworm, 
        Ascaris lumbricoides , and the whipworm, 
        Trichuris trichiura , are often referred to collectively as
        soil-transmitted helminths (STHs).
        No international surveillance mechanisms are in place to determine the prevalence and
        global distribution of hookworm infection. However, based on an extensive search of the
        literature since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the worldwide number of cases of hookworm was recently estimated to
        be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">740 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The highest prevalence of hookworm occurs in sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
        and eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). High transmission (defined below) also occurs in other areas
        of rural poverty in the tropics, including southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subcontinent</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>],
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In all regions, there is a striking relationship between hookworm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX> and low socioeconomic status (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hookworm</ENAMEX>'s neglected status partly
        reflects its concentration among the world's poorest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7 billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who live on less
        than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2</NUMEX> a day.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinical Features</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiology</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disease Burden</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hookworm</ENAMEX> infection is acquired by invasion of the infective larval stages through the
        skin (
        A. duodenale larvae are also orally infective). Following host
        entry, the larvae undergo a journey through the vasculature, then the lungs and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, before they enter the gastrointestinal tract and molt twice to become
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">centimeter-long</NUMEX> adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> and the female
        hookworms produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> per day, which exit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in the feces
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Because hookworms do not replicate in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> of hookworm is highest among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that harbor large numbers of adult parasites. Estimates of the intensity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hookworm</ENAMEX> infection are typically obtained by using quantitative fecal egg counts as a
        surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marker</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> burden. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> defines moderate-intensity
        infections as those with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000–3,999</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of feces, and heavy-intensity infections
        as those with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 26</ENAMEX> in [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]). Compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STH</ENAMEX> infections
        and schistosomiasis, hookworm infection exhibits a unique age-intensity profile—whereas the
        intensities for the former peak in childhood and adolescence, hookworm intensity usually
        either steadily rises in intensity with age or plateaus in adulthood [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,9</NUMEX>]. The biological
        basis for this observation is unknown [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        Adult hookworms cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> by producing intestinal hemorrhage [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The
        adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hookworms</ENAMEX> then ingest the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, rupture the erythrocytes, and degrade the hemoglobin
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Therefore, the disease attributed to hookworm is silent blood loss leading to iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency anemia</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX>. There is a correlation between parasite
        intensity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> intestinal blood loss [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]; in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of reproductive age, and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with low iron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, there is often a correlation between parasite
        intensity and reductions in host hemoglobin [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,12,13,14,15,16</NUMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, chronic
        heavy-intensity infections are associated with growth <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX>, as well as intellectual
        and cognitive impairments; in pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, they are associated with adverse
        maternal–fetal outcomes [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,12,13,14,15,16</NUMEX>].
        When measured in disability-adjusted life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, the global disease burden from hookworm
        exceeds all other major tropical infectious diseases with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>,
        leishmaniasis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lymphatic filariasis</ENAMEX> (pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">192–193</NUMEX> in [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]). In addition, hookworm has
        been associated with impaired learning, increased absences from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and decreased
        future economic productivity [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Therefore, like other neglected diseases, chronic
        infection with hookworm promotes long-term disability and increases the likelihood that an
        afflicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will remain mired in poverty.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hookworm Control Strategies</ENAMEX>
        Because of its high transmission potential, hookworm has proven to be extremely
        difficult to eliminate or eradicate in areas of poverty and poor sanitation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Indeed,
        in the absence of comprehensive economic development, the impact of sanitation, footwear,
        and health education has been minimal [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> efforts have therefore shifted to
        reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> through mass treatment (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">“deworming”</ENAMEX>) of affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with anthelminthic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        Although benzimidazoles (BZAs) are the most commonly used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for treating STH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">levamisole</ENAMEX> and pyrantel may also be used in some circumstances. Periodic and
        repeated deworming with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BZAs</ENAMEX> and praziquantel, complemented by basic sanitation and
        adequate safe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, is considered the most cost-effective means to control the morbidity
        caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STH</ENAMEX> and schistosome infections [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,20,21,22</NUMEX>]. Efforts led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> have focused on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twice-yearly</TIMEX>, or thrice-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> doses in schools
        because the heaviest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intensities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STH</ENAMEX> infections are most commonly encountered in
        school-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        Among the health benefits of periodic deworming of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> are improvements in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX> and hemoglobin status, physical growth and fitness, and cognition [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,21,22,23</NUMEX>]. In
        addition, there are important externalities, including improvements in education and
        reduced community-based transmission of ascaris and trichuris infections [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Accordingly,
        at the 54th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Assembly</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, a resolution was passed urging member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to
        attain a minimum target of regular deworming of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 75% and up to 100%</NUMEX> of all at-risk
        school-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,23</NUMEX>].
      
      
        Developing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Control Tool</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na-ASP-2 Hookworm Vaccine</ENAMEX>
        Deworming satisfies a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations Millennium Development</ENAMEX> Goals including
        those related to poverty reduction, child health, and education. However, there are also
        several reasons to believe that the school-based deworming programs could have less of an
        impact on the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> from hookworm than from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STH</ENAMEX> and schistosome
        infections [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. As noted above, heavy-intensity hookworm infections are common among both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, so school-based programs would not be expected to have an impact on
        hookworm transmission in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. School-based programs are also not likely to
        affect either preschool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, despite evidence for the health
        benefits from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BZAs</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,25</NUMEX>]. Finally, a single dose of mebendazole (one
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BZAs</ENAMEX>) has variable efficacy against hookworm [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], and following
        treatment, hookworm reinfection to pre-treatment levels can occur within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4–12 months</TIMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        This, and the observation that the efficacy of mebendazole against hookworm can diminish
        with frequent and repeated use, has prompted concerns about the possible emergence of BZA
        resistance [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>].
        As a complementary strategy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative</ENAMEX> (HHVI) is developing
        a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na -ASP-2 Hookworm Vaccine</ENAMEX>, that would provide an additional tool for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hookworm</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,30</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHVI</ENAMEX> is a non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> comprising research,
        process development, vaccine manufacturing and control, and pre-clinical and clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London School of Hygiene and Tropical</ENAMEX>
        Medicine, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oswaldo Cruz Foundation</ENAMEX> (FIOCRUZ), and sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabin Vaccine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sabin</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHVI</ENAMEX> selected the hookworm larval <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen ASP-2</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ancylostoma</ENAMEX> secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-2</ENAMEX>)
        based on studies that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) identified the molecule as a protective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> linked to
        earlier-generation irradiated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infective larval vaccines</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) determined a relationship
        between human anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ASP-2 antibodies</ENAMEX> and reduced risk of heavy hookworm infection in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> living in hookworm-endemic regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> ([<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Bethony</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loukas, M. J. Smout</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Brooker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Mendez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, unpublished data), and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) confirmed
        the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant ASP-2</ENAMEX> to partially protect laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> against larval
        hookworm challenges [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,31,32</NUMEX>].
        Process development, cGMP manufacture and control, and pre-clinical testing of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na -ASP-2</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> americanus were completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval, clinical testing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> will take
        place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na -ASP-2 Hookworm Vaccine</ENAMEX> will be developed almost entirely in the
        non-profit sector. Ultimately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> will be indicated for the active immunization of
        susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> against moderate and heavy necator infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaccination</ENAMEX> would
        reduce the number of hookworm infective larvae entering the gastrointestinal tract, thereby
        reducing the number of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> and the fecal egg counts in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> exposed to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larvae</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Hookworm as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX>
        Because immunization would only affect hookworm larvae and not adult hookworms already
        residing in the gastrointestinal tract of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dose of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> would be administered following deworming. Therefore, use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> could
        build on the infrastructures developed as part of school-based programs. Given that
        hookworm afflicts only the world's most impoverished, a major hurdle for the development of
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na -ASP-2 Hookworm Vaccine</ENAMEX> is its small commercial market. Innovative
        financing mechanisms must be considered to produce this orphan biologic. Towards that end,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHVI</ENAMEX> has partnered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> in hookworm-endemic middle-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that
        would commit to industrial scale-up of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Na -ASP-2 Hookworm Vaccine</ENAMEX> pending proof-of-principle for its efficacy.
        This approach might help to inform the development of business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for the production
        and distribution of orphan biologics for other neglected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
