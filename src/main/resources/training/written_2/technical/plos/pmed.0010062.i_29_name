        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studies, a dose-response relationship between short sleep duration and
        high body mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>) has been reported across all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1‚Äì7</NUMEX>]. In the largest
        studied sample, elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> occurred for habitual sleep amounts below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7‚Äì8</NUMEX> h [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-shaped curvilinear relationship between sleep duration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, there was a monotonic trend towards higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> with shorter sleep duration.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, a recent prospective study identified a longitudinal association between sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curtailment</ENAMEX> and future weight gain [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. How sleep curtailment may interact with body weight
        is unknown, but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> regulating appetite and energy expenditure may be involved.
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> may mediate the interactions between short sleep duration,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, and high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. We hypothesized that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> in appetite
        regulation, leptin and ghrelin [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9</NUMEX>], play a significant role in the interaction between
        short sleep duration and high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leptin</ENAMEX> is an adipocyte-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> that suppresses
        appetite [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghrelin</ENAMEX> is predominantly a stomach-derived peptide that stimulates appetite
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,11</NUMEX>]. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of metabolism that may contribute include adiponectin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adiponectin</ENAMEX> is a novel hormone secreted by adipocytes and is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        sensitivity [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,13</NUMEX>]. We investigated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> among sleep duration (acute and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">habitual</ENAMEX>), metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study</ENAMEX>
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Methods
        
          Overview
          The institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Wisconsin Medical School</ENAMEX> approved
          all protocols for the study, and informed consent was obtained from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study</ENAMEX> is an ongoing longitudinal study of sleep habits and
          disorders in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Briefly, to construct a defined sampling frame,
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> aged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30‚Äì60 y</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in south central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> were mailed
          a survey on sleep habits, health, and demographics in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mailed</ENAMEX> surveys were repeated
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-y intervals. A stratified random sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> was then recruited for an
          extensive overnight protocol including polysomnography at baseline. Stratification was
          based on risk for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), with an oversampling of habitual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snorers</ENAMEX> to ensure an adequate distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX>. Analyses were adjusted for the
          weighted sampling when appropriate. Recruitment for baseline studies was staggered to
          conduct <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> studies per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>; study entry and follow-up time thus varied within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX>. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, unstable cardiopulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, airway
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, and recent upper respiratory tract surgery. The baseline response rate was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX>,
          with most refusals due to the inconvenience of sleeping away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Follow-up studies
          have been conducted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-y</TIMEX> intervals, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to three</NUMEX> follow-up studies to date.
          Collection of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, fasted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was added to the protocol in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. Extensive survey
          and other data available from the sampling frame have been used to evaluate the potential
          for response and drop out biases.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> provides an overview of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the data collected. The
          sample comprised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,024</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with an overnight study and blood sample. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-d diary
          of sleep duration was added as part of a protocol to assess <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime sleepiness</TIMEX> after the
          initiation of the cohort study; these data were available for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">721</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection</ENAMEX>
          This investigation is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study</ENAMEX> data collected from the
          mailed sleep surveys, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> studies, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-d sleep diaries. Overnight studies were
          conducted in laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> setting their own sleep and rise
          times. After informed consent was obtained, questionnaires on lifestyle and health
          history were administered, and height and weight measured. A blood sample was collected
          shortly after awakening from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> polysomnography.
          
            Polysomnography
            An <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-channel polysomnographic system was used to assess sleep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> and cardiac variables [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Sleep was studied using electroencephalography,
            electro-oculography, and chin electromyography (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grass Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quincy</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). Continuous measurement of arterial oxyhemoglobin
            saturation by pulse oximetry (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohmeda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Englewood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), oral and
            nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">airflow</ENAMEX>, nasal air pressure, and thoracic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> and abdominal respiratory motion
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Respitrace Ambulatory Monitoring, Ardsley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) were used to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assess SDB</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-s interval of the polysomnographic record was scored for sleep
            stage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX> using standard criteria [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. The average number of apneas and hypopneas
            per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hour</NUMEX> of measured sleep, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), was the measure for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX>.
            For analyses including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHI</ENAMEX> as a covariate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were excluded if they had sleep
            studies with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 4</NUMEX> h of usable polysomnography, or if they were receiving
            treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Polysomnographic measures of acute sleep
            Polysomnographic measures of sleep duration just prior to blood sampling were used
            to evaluate degree of ‚Äúacute sleep restriction.<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚ÄúTotal sleep time‚Äù</ENAMEX> was total <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polysomnographically</ENAMEX> defined sleep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWake</ENAMEX> after sleep onset‚Äù (WASO) was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of wake
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> epochs of sleep had occurred. ‚ÄúSleep efficiency‚Äù was total sleep time
            divided by time from lights out until arising in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>.
          
          
            Self-reported sleep measures of chronic sleep
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> variables were used to evaluate degree of ‚Äúchronic sleep restriction‚Äù by
            estimating average nightly sleep duration: (i) ‚Äúusual sleep‚Äù (from questionnaires) and
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii) ‚Äúaverage nightly sleep‚Äù</ENAMEX> (from sleep diaries).
          
          
            Questionnaire
            Usual sleep was estimated from the following questions: how many <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of sleep do
            you usually get in (a) a workday <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>? (b) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> or non-work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>? These
            questions were included in all mailed surveys and were added to questionnaires
            completed at the overnight study in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> studied after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, data
            from questionnaires administered at the overnight study were used (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>); for the
            remainder of the sample, data from the mailed survey closest in time to the overnight
            study were used. Usual sleep was calculated as (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> √ó workday sleep + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> √ó weekend
            sleep)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/7</TIMEX>.
          
          
            Sleep diary
            Average sleep duration was also estimated using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-d sleep diary, kept by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">721</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> as part of an added protocol to measure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</TIMEX> sleepiness. The median
            time between the blood collection and completion of the diary was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">d. Almost all</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diaries</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>) were completed within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 mo</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood sampling</ENAMEX>. In diaries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
            recorded the time they went to bed and arose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>, and the duration of any naps.
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">‚ÄúAverage</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> sleep‚Äù was calculated as the sum of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> between bedtime and
            arising divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>. ‚ÄúAverage nightly sleep plus naps‚Äù added naps to the above
            sum.
          
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Relationship</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleep Duration</ENAMEX>
          For the analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and sleep duration, the sample comprised
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,040</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one 6</NUMEX>-d sleep diary. Of these, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-, 8-</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-y
          follow-up studies had been completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">397, 179</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> respectively (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,828</NUMEX>
          visits), providing repeated measures data for greater analytic efficiency and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hormone Assays</ENAMEX>
          Following overnight fasting, serum was collected soon after awakening and stored at
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">‚àí70 ¬∞C</NUMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were assayed in duplicate. It was not possible to assay samples from
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in all assays because of the volume of serum available; this
          particularly affected the ghrelin assay, which required the most volume. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leptin</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> were determined using enzyme-linked immunoassays (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA; Linco Research</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). Total ghrelin and adiponectin were measured by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radioimmunoassay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linco Research</ENAMEX>). Sensitivity for the leptin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> enzyme-linked
          immunoassays was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 ŒºU/</ENAMEX>ml, respectively. Sensitivity for the ghrelin and
          adiponectin radioimmunoassays was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pg/ml and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml, respectively. Intra- and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-assay variations were all <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 5% and less than 10%</NUMEX>, respectively. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quantitative insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1/</NUMEX>(log (
          I ) + log (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> )), where 
          I is fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and 
          G is fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,16</NUMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          All analyses were cross-sectional and performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS/STAT</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.2</NUMEX>. Leptin, ghrelin,
          and adiponectin were square-root transformed and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> log transformed based on the
          distribution of residuals from the multivariate regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. We evaluated the
          relationship of age, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and time of storage of blood sample on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple regression</ENAMEX>. Partial correlations adjusted for age, sex, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> were calculated
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUICKI</ENAMEX>, with and without control of other potential confounders. The
          relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and sleep were evaluated using multiple linear regression
          after control for potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">confounders</ENAMEX> including age, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX>, and morningness
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tendencies</ENAMEX> (as measured using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horne-Ostberg</ENAMEX> questionnaire, an indirect surrogate of
          earlier rising time). In all analyses involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUICKI</ENAMEX> (but not
          leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (self-reported diagnosis,
          or currently taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic medications</ENAMEX>, or with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> ><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300 mg/dl</ENAMEX>) were
          excluded. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX> were not removed from the analyses shown. When
          controlling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who used continuous positive airway pressure
          or who had inadequate sleep were excluded. Because controlling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHI</ENAMEX> did not
          significantly change the sleep-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regression coefficients</ENAMEX>, these analyses are not
          shown. The relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> with average nightly sleep was evaluated using a quadratic
          fit. This was examined using multiple visits (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,828</NUMEX>) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,040</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with sleep diary data available.
          Mixed modeling techniques were used to account for within-subject correlation for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with multiple visits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> procedure mixed was used for modeling and
          hypothesis testing using robust standard errors and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> symmetric within-subject
          correlation structure. All reported 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> values are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided. For illustrative purposes, changes in leptin,
          ghrelin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> for different sleep amounts were calculated at the average values and
          sex distribution of the relevant sample.
        
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> shows the characteristics of the sample, unadjusted for the weighted sampling
        scheme. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> shows the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-min intervals of average nightly sleep after
        adjustment for age and sex. We found a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-shaped curvilinear relationship
        between average nightly sleep and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> after adjustment for age and sex (average nightly
        sleep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">‚àí2.40</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.008</NUMEX>; (average nightly sleep)
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.156</NUMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.008</NUMEX>; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> coefficients define a curve). The minimum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was
        predicted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.7</NUMEX> h of average nightly sleep. The most striking portion of the curve was for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> sleeping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 8</NUMEX> h (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74.4%</NUMEX> of the sample), where increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was proportional
        to decreased sleep. An increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31.3 to 32.4</NUMEX> (+<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.6%</NUMEX>) corresponded approximately
        to an average nightly sleep duration decrease from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 h to 5 h</NUMEX>, as estimated at the mean age
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.1 y</NUMEX>) and sex distribution (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.4%</NUMEX> male) of the sample with available sleep diary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUICKI</ENAMEX> with age,
        sex, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. Serum ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> were significantly
        correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and sex. Storage time had significant effects on some but not all
        variables; in all cases, however, effect size was small, and the effect was corrected for
        in all calculations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adiponectin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> were correlated with age. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> shows
        partial correlations among the measured and calculated variables, adjusted for age, sex,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">correlations</ENAMEX> agree with previous studies and validate our assays and
        population sample. We also examined several potential confounders to be later controlled
        for, if needed, in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Identified relationships included: ghrelin with high-density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (HDL), alcohol intake, and creatinine; leptin with diastolic blood pressure,
        smoking, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN); adiponectin with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uric acid</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUN</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uric acid</ENAMEX>, and smoking; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>,
        triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uric acid</ENAMEX>, alcohol intake, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUN</ENAMEX>, and creatinine; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUICKI</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>,
        triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uric acid</ENAMEX>, smoking, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUN</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetics</ENAMEX> (diagnosed) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        with high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">glucose >300 mg/dl</ENAMEX>) were removed from this analysis, all
        relationships remained significant except for the correlation between ghrelin and
        adiponectin, and ghrelin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>.
        Using polysomnography to measure objective sleep immediately prior to blood sampling,
        ghrelin correlated significantly with total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASO</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Using questionnaire and diary data estimating chronic sleep, significant correlations
        were found between leptin and average nightly sleep (with and without naps) and usual sleep
        amounts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). A significant correlation was also observed between ghrelin and average
        nightly sleep plus naps. These relationships were consistently found when other possible
        confounding factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHI</ENAMEX>, and factors listed above were
        included in the statistical model (analysis not shown). In unadjusted models, leptin was
        significantly correlated with total sleep time and average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> sleep with naps, and
        ghrelin was significantly correlated with sleep efficiency and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASO</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX> shows the
        mean leptin levels for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> increments of average nightly sleep after adjustment for
        age, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and time of storage (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In the multiple regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 4</ENAMEX>), there was a significant increasing trend in leptin for average nightly sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>). When evaluated at the average values and sex distribution of
        our sample, a decrease from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 to 5 h</NUMEX> in average nightly sleep was associated with a
        predicted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.5%</NUMEX> decrease in leptin. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX> shows the mean ghrelin levels for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX>
        increments of total sleep time after adjustment for age, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and time of storage (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In the multiple regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), there was a significant
        decreasing trend in ghrelin with total sleep time (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.008</NUMEX>). When evaluated at the average values and sex distribution of
        our sample, a decrease from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 to 5 h</NUMEX> of polysomnographically defined total sleep time was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a predicted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.9%</NUMEX> increase in ghrelin. There was no significant correlation
        between sleep duration (acute or chronic) and serum adiponectin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUICKI</ENAMEX>. Results of our analyses were unchanged after adjusting for the weighted sampling
        scheme.
      
      
        Discussion
        We found that habitual sleep duration below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.7</NUMEX> h was associated with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
        similar to findings in other studies including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,17</NUMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>]. We also report a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of sleep duration with leptin and ghrelin
        that is independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, age, sex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX>, and other possible confounding factors (analysis
        not shown for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX> and other confounders). Short sleep duration was associated with
        decreased leptin and increased ghrelin, changes that have also been observed in reaction to
        food restriction and weight loss and are typically associated with increased appetite.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alterations</ENAMEX> may contribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> increase that occurs with sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curtailment</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies have shown that both acute sleep deprivation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>] and chronic partial
        sleep deprivation (sleep restriction) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] can cause a decrease in serum leptin
        concentrations. These studies, however, were performed under highly controlled laboratory
        circumstances. Our results validate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of decreased leptin with decreased
        sleep time in a large sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under</TIMEX> real-life conditions and, now, indicate a role
        for ghrelin. Leptin deficiency increases appetite and produces <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">obesity</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,20</NUMEX>]. Leptin
        administration suppresses food intake and reduces energy expenditure [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21,22</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Importantly,</ENAMEX>
        low leptin as observed with sleep loss has a greater impact on appetite than high leptin
        levels, which are associated with leptin resistance, as occurs with obesity [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        Levels of ghrelin, a potent stimulator of appetite [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,24,25</NUMEX>], were higher in those with
        shorter sleep. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghrelin</ENAMEX> levels are also positively associated with hunger ratings [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], but
        decrease with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In one study, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mo of dietary supervision,
        a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> was associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> increase in ghrelin and a
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> decrease in leptin [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. These changes, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> of similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> to our sample
        and presumably producing increased appetite, are comparable to those observed with sleep
        loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2‚Äì3 h/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. With sleep loss, however, relatively high ghrelin and low leptin
        levels are associated with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. These changes can be hypothesized to play a
        contributory, rather than compensatory, role in the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obesity
        with sleep restriction.
        Our findings are strengthened by the large and well-characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based
        sample, attention to bias and confounding factors, and in-laboratory polysomnographic data.
        The changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> with sleep duration were consistent and of significant magnitude.
        They also represent the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstration of a correlation between peripheral hormone
        levels and both self-reported (questionnaire and diary data) and polysomnographically
        determined sleep amounts in a general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> sample. While these data are more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> than previous studies on this topic, some misclassification error may exist
        because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">intra</NUMEX>-person variability or limitations of polysomnographic measurement. Little
        is known about the stability of self-reported sleep duration and polysomnographic measures
        of sleep duration over time. We examined the stability of the self-reported sleep duration
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, and found these measures to be stable. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">860</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who completed three
        surveys, the mean (standard deviation) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">intra</NUMEX>-person differences in usual sleep for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-y periods was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.10</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.47</NUMEX>) h. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> sleep diaries, the
        mean (standard deviation) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">intra</NUMEX>-person differences in average nightly sleep for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 4-y
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.09</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.41</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Furthermore</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subjectively</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of usual sleep
        and the diary-derived average nightly sleep values were highly correlated (
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.55</NUMEX>, 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.001</NUMEX>). One-night polysomnographically defined total sleep time
        had a similar intra-person mean difference (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> h), with a somewhat larger standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.68</NUMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">713</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> sleep studies.
        Elevated ghrelin mainly correlated with acute sleep loss as measured by polysomnography
        immediately prior to blood sampling (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>), while reduced leptin
        correlated with chronic sleep restriction indicated by self-reported sleep measures (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). Measures of usual and one-night polysomnographically defined sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> were only weakly, but statistically significantly, correlated (
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>, 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.001</NUMEX>), supporting the concept that these measures reflect
        long-term and short-term changes in sleep amounts, respectively. Our findings are in
        agreement with the current view that leptin is important in signaling long-term nutritional
        status while ghrelin has a more significant role in acute hunger. The changes in leptin and
        ghrelin with sleep restriction could, therefore, provide a powerful dual stimulus to food
        intake that may culminate in obesity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longitudinal</ENAMEX> and intervention studies will be necessary to define further the link
        between sleep curtailment and increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. Only total ghrelin was measured, since active
        octanoylated ghrelin is unstable. Although both total and active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ghrelin</ENAMEX> appear to be
        regulated in a similar and parallel manner, future studies will need to focus on
        measurement of the biologically active form. Other potentially important appetite
        regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PYY</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3‚Äì36</NUMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>], were not measured. Measures of appetite were
        not included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study</ENAMEX> overnight protocol; therefore, a direct
        examination of the relationship between the observed hormone changes with sleep duration
        and alterations in appetite was not possible.
        Hormone measurements were all performed on a single fasted, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> sample and may not
        reflect the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h profile. It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with shorter sleep woke up
        earlier and that hormone differences may be partially related to circadian time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leptin</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ghrelin</ENAMEX> levels rise slightly during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], and this could result in higher hormone
        levels in short sleepers. This may be an issue for ghrelin, as levels increased with acute
        sleep restriction. It is, however, unlikely to play a role in the leptin finding, since
        lower levels were found with chronic but not acute sleep restriction. Additionally, studies
        have shown a high correlation <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between morning</TIMEX>, fasting leptin and ghrelin levels and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
        mean profile [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,30</NUMEX>]. We also found that the ghrelin and leptin changes were unaffected by
        morningness tendencies. The fact that studies investigating the diurnal profile of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> found similar hormonal changes over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire 24-h</TIMEX> period after experimental
        sleep restriction also corroborates our results [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,19</NUMEX>]. The robustness of our findings and
        similar observations from smaller controlled studies [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,19</NUMEX>] also suggest that our
        statistically significant results are unlikely to be a reflection of the number of analyses
        carried out.
        Animal studies have suggested a link between sleep and metabolism [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,32</NUMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>,
        prolonged, complete sleep deprivation increased both food intake and energy expenditure.
        The net effect was weight loss and, ultimately, death [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>]. Rats fed a high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-to-calorie</ENAMEX> diet had accelerated weight loss, compared to sleep-deprived <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> fed
        calorie-augmented (fatty) diets [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Food</ENAMEX> consumption remained normal in sleep-deprived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats fed protein-rich</ENAMEX> diets, but increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">250%</NUMEX> in rats fed calorie-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diets</ENAMEX>. Preference
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty foods</ENAMEX> has also been reported anecdotally in sleep-deprived <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,34</NUMEX>]. Sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deprivation</ENAMEX> may thus increase not only appetite but also preference for lipid-rich,
        high-calorie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. Animal experiments that have found weight loss after prolonged sleep
        deprivation have to be interpreted in the context of a stressful procedure producing
        intense sleep debt [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,36</NUMEX>], which may interfere with adequate food intake. From our study,
        we hypothesize that the moderate chronic sleep debt associated with habitual short sleep is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased appetite and energy expenditure. In societies where high-calorie
        food is freely available and consumption uncontrolled, after milder chronic sleep
        restriction, the equation may be tipped towards food intake for high-calorie food rather
        than expenditure, culminating in obesity. Short <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sleepers</ENAMEX> may also have more time to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overeat</ENAMEX>.
        Sleep loss from a baseline of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.7</NUMEX> h was associated with a dose-dependent increase in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. This was the predominant effect in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> increasingly curtailing sleep [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>].
        Sleep greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.7</NUMEX> h, however, was also associated with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX> (a pathology associated with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>) may spend a longer time in bed to
        compensate for fragmented sleep; however, controlling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AHI</ENAMEX> did not change the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curvilinear BMI‚</ENAMEX>Äìsleep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. Another possibility is that in long sleepers, reduced
        energy expenditure due to increased time in bed has a greater impact than reduced food
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>. In favor of this hypothesis, long sleepers exercise less [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. In our data, we
        found that the odds ratio of high levels of self-reported exercise (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>7 h/wk</ENAMEX>), based on a
        single survey question, decreased with increased sleep time, but controlling for this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> also did not change our findings (analyses not shown).
        Insulin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> with sleep deprivation has been reported in a laboratory study of
        young, healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. When controlling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, we found no significant
        correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>, or adiponectin levels and various measures of sleep
        duration. Also, there was no significant correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUICKI</ENAMEX> (or the homeostatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">model assessment HOMA</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]; data not shown) and sleep duration. This may be due to
        difficulties in detecting small effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose tolerance</ENAMEX> under less-controlled
        conditions of large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studies.
        Our results demonstrate an important relationship between sleep and metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>.
        The direct effect of chronic partial sleep loss on food intake, energy expenditure, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> now needs to be explored. Altering sleep duration may prove to be an important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjunct</ENAMEX> to preventing and treating obesity.
