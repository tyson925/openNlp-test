        given the amount of environmental variation they encounter during development and the
        amount of genetic variation within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This phenotypic constancy led to the
        proposal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were somehow buffered, or canalized, against genetic and
        environmental variation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waddington 1942).</ENAMEX> Clearly, such a mechanism would have important
        evolutionary consequences; because natural selection acts upon phenotypic variation within
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, canalization first appears to reduce the evolvability of the trait upon which
        it is acting (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagner 2000).</ENAMEX> However, canalization also reduces the effects of
        new mutations (which may be deleterious), potentially allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to store this
        genetic variation without suffering the consequences. If canalization breaks down due to
        genetic or environmental circumstances, then the stored genetic variation will be released,
        providing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional substrate</NUMEX> for natural selection. In this way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> could
        potentially undergo large, rapid phenotypic changes.
        Experiments in both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        Arabidopsis have suggested that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90</TIMEX> (heat shock protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>), a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> expressed at high temperatures (heat shock), may be an
        excellent candidate for bringing about canalization (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rutherford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lindquist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Queitsch et al. 2002</ENAMEX>). Several features of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90</TIMEX> suggest that it is an evolutionary buffer,
        capable of hiding and then releasing genetic variation: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> heterozygous for
        mutations in 
        Hsp83 (the gene encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hsp90</ENAMEX>) show increased levels of morphological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of Hsp90 show
        severe morphological abnormalities; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the normal function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hsp90</ENAMEX> is to stabilise the
        tertiary structure of signal transduction molecules involved in developmental pathways; and
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) this function may be compromised by environmental factors, e.g., heat shock.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Networks Generate Canalization</ENAMEX>
        Hsp90 may not, however, be uniquely placed to act as an evolutionary buffer producing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canalization</ENAMEX>. Recent theoretical work has suggested that canalization may be an emergent
        property of complex gene networks and may not require specific mechanisms of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stabilisation</ENAMEX> and environmental coupling such as those provided by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bergman 2002</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergman</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>) proposed that when a network is compromised by
        â€˜knocking outâ€™ one of several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, buffering may be lost or compromised, releasing
        variation that was hidden in the intact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. To test this, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>)
        used numerical simulations of a complex network of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in which each gene is capable
        of influencing the expression of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> as well as itself (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). This network
        essentially defines the genotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and the amount
        of gene expression at equilibrium defines the phenotype. Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> founded
        by either wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or those with a single gene â€˜knockoutâ€™ revealed much higher
        levels of phenotypic variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜knockoutsâ€™</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> derived from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜knockoutsâ€™ express phenotypic variation that was not
        expressed by the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, suggesting that any of the genes within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> may
        buffer genetic variation. This suggests that at least one aspect of generating evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buffering</ENAMEX> is not unique to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90</TIMEX>. But can genes that, unlike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90</TIMEX>, are not conditional
        upon the environment act as evolutionary buffers? To test this, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>)
        simulated a gene network that incorporated a mutation process in which single genes may be
        â€˜knocked outâ€™ and then, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX>, restored. The simulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were allowed
        to evolve whilst being selected for an optimum phenotype (i.e., the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were
        exposed to an environment in which a particular phenotype was optimal). A new optimum
        phenotype was then specified in which the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> network genes
        changed from on to off or vice versa (i.e., there was a shift in the environmental
        conditions favouring a different phenotype). Populations evolving with the mutation process
        reached the new optimum before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> without the mutation process. Thus, the
        â€˜knockoutâ€™ mutations were clearly beneficial because they sped up adaptation to a new
        phenotypic optimum by releasing hidden genetic variation, thereby providing a new substrate
        upon which natural selection may act. Yet these mutations were not coupled to the new
        environment, suggesting that the release of the hidden genetic variation does not have to
        be linked to an environmental change in order to be beneficial.
        The simulations described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) suggest that the key properties
        of an evolutionary buffer, the ability to store and then release genetic variation in
        response to environmental or genetic change, are not unique to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hsp90</TIMEX>. Indeed, the
        simulations suggest that evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffering</ENAMEX> may be a widespread property of gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. They also suggest that the hidden genetic variation does not have to be revealed
        by an environmental change, but can be produced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene â€˜knockoutâ€™</ENAMEX>. These results may go
        some way to explain the original observation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waddington</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>) of phenotypic constancy,
        yet many questions remain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns 2003</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the major outstanding questions must be
        whether it is possible to verify these results experimentally. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>)
        used data from the yeast 
        Sacchromyces cerevisiae , in which each gene may be â€˜knocked
        outâ€™ in turn and the expression of the remaining genes determined, to demonstrate that
        their simulations also had application to biological gene networks. Using these data, they
        showed that â€˜knockoutsâ€™ show greater variability in gene expression than wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
        suggesting that buffering has been disrupted.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ion Channels</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evolutionary Buffers</ENAMEX>
        Given the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), it should be possible to find gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in which the elimination of single genes reveals variation in gene expression and
        hence in phenotype. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of gene network that may conform to the structure outlined by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) is that of the gene networks regulating ion channel expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. Neurons contain an array of voltage-dependent Na
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> as well as numerous Cl
        âˆ’ , Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ , and voltage-independent leak channels. The electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of
        a single neuron are dependent, though not exclusively, upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> of ion channels
        expressed within that neuron. The properties of a neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, which generates
        behaviour, are determined both by the intrinsic expression patterns of ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and the connectivity between neurons. The nervous system develops as an interaction
        between experience and genetically programmed events. One mechanism by which this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> is achieved is ion channel compensation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turrigiano 1999</ENAMEX>); individual neurons
        can change their sensitivity to inputs by altering the relative proportion of ion channels,
        enabling them to maintain stable properties in the face of changing experience (Turrigiano
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 1994</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brickley et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maclean et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niven et al.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2003a</ENAMEX>) (Figure
        1B).
        Many studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ion channel â€˜knockoutsâ€™</ENAMEX> show relatively little change in overall
        neuronal activity, although predictions based upon pharmacological blockade of the ion
        channels suggest there should be a more severe phenotypic change (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prinz 2002).</ENAMEX>
        Subsequent work has shown that the loss of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channel</ENAMEX> may often be compensated by a
        change in the expression of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX>. For example, the neurons upon which I work
        are 
        Drosophila photoreceptors. In these neurons, loss of the one
        particular ion channel leads to compensatory changes in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> linked to the
        activity of the neuron to restore the ability to process visual information (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niven et</ENAMEX> al.
        2003a, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003b</TIMEX>). However, these changes do not restore the original phenotype completely, and
        the compensated photoreceptors still show a reduced ability to process visual information.
        In many neurons, it appears that the intracellular Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ concentration acts as an internal sensor of neural activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marder</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prinz 2002).</ENAMEX> Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ , along with other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX>, may influence the expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding ion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, allowing their expression to be coupled to neural activity
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berridge 1998)</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B and 1C</TIMEX>). Additionally, activity-independent mechanisms of ion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> compensation have been described in which the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channel</ENAMEX> is
        linked to the expression of other opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> within a neuron (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maclean et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems of activity-dependent and activity-independent ion channel
        compensation bear a close resemblance to the gene network simulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegal</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) in which each gene regulates its own expression and that of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> genes.
        It is possible, therefore, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of genes regulating ion channel expression
        may act as evolutionary buffers. The relationship between neural activity and the network
        of ion channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encoding genes</ENAMEX> may stabilise the neural activity in relation to both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> and environmental variation. The stabilisation of neural activity may have
        consequences for the generation of adaptive behaviour, which is constructed from neural
        activity. It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> could canalize the evolution of the nervous
        system by reducing behavioural variation and therefore removing the substrate on which
        natural selection may act. For example, changes in voltage-dependent Na
        + channel properties (such as the activation voltage) may be compensated
        for by regulating the expression of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜Knockoutâ€™</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these
        compensating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX> may reveal the change in voltage-dependent Na
        + channel properties, resulting in a shift in the output of the neuron.
        This hypothesis has several testable predictions. For example, â€˜knocking outâ€™ an ion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> should increase the variation in the activity of particular neurons among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This variation in neural activity may produce an effect on the
        behaviour of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
        Studying canalization in ion channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> may have significant advantages over
        studying developmental gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> because it is relatively straightforward to measure
        the amounts of ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> expressed in single identified neurons, to alter the expression
        of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX>, and to relate these alterations to behaviour. I am currently
        pursuing the impact of ion channel compensation in 
        Drosophila photoreceptors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niven et al.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2003a</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003b</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003c</TIMEX>). In
        this system, changes in ion channel expression produce changes in the coding of visual
        information, which may lead to behavioural differences. The possible role of ion channel
        compensation in canalizing the evolution of the nervous system may have important
        implications not just for understanding this system, but also for understanding the
        contribution of ion channel compensation to the function of the nervous system and its
        evolution.
