        Epidemics typically start at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of February</TIMEX> and last until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>. We can try to
        explain the observed patterns on the basis of some seasonally varying environmental factor
        that favors disease transmission. Air dryness produced by strong dust winds is the most
        likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>.
        But while there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">qualitative “stories”</ENAMEX> of this kind in the literature for many
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> phenomena, convincing quantitative evidence to support them remains largely
        elusive. Instead, we tend to see weak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between environmental and transmission
        variables when measured by simple, linear correlations. The study of meningococcal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meningitis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mali</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> is a remarkable exception [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The study reports a strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> onset of epidemics and a large-scale regional index for
        atmospheric circulation related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harmattan</ENAMEX> winds in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sahelo-Sudanian Africa</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Importance of Seasonality</ENAMEX>
        Why is a focus on the seasonality of infectious diseases and its variation from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> so important? Isn't it more important for us to instead understand the effects of
        long-term climate change on human health?
        At first sight, understanding seasonal patterns seems disconnected from understanding
        the impact of long-term climate change. However, seasonal patterns are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major pathway
        for the subtle but potentially drastic effects of climate change on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease dynamics</ENAMEX>.
        Long-term climate change affects seasonal patterns through the lengthening of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> and the crossing of environmental and demographic thresholds that
        underlie seasonal outbreaks [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Thus, identifying the specific environmental factors
        underlying seasonal transmission is a critical step towards predicting and understanding
        how long-term environmental trends in mean climate and their variability will impact human
        health.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Problem</ENAMEX> of Scale
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important difficulty in uncovering seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> of infectious diseases is to
        identify the appropriate scale of analysis. The relationship between disease and climate
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> only becomes apparent at large spatial scales. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> argue that these large scales are necessary to eliminate “idiosyncratic”
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the relationship between cases and climate at the local level. In other
        words, there are only weak correlations between seasonal variations and climate variables
        at small scales because of the multiple other factors that play a local role and act as
        noise.
        But we should be cautious about the suggestion that appropriate larger scales will
        always resolve the problem of local variability and present strong linear associations
        between climate and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Public health measures might require predictions not only at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> and regional scales, but also at a variety of smaller scales.
        Moreover, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important source of variation in how infectious diseases respond to
        climate is the fraction of susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This fraction varies
        over time as the result of immunity acquired by previous infection, and by the input of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">births</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX> into the pool of susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The constant waxing and waning of
        this pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> underlies the intrinsic potential of the population dynamics of
        infectious diseases to oscillate and create epidemic outbreaks. The tendency of these
        intrinsic cycles to go up and down in synchrony at different locations in space will
        determine whether susceptibility levels act as noise at small scales or, alternatively,
        whether their effect must be considered in conjunction with climate at larger scales.
        Because the number of susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is a hidden variable in most epidemiological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, recently proposed methods for its reconstruction from data on cases must be
        combined with studies on climate variation if we are to understand the interaction between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> levels and climate variation [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>].
        The problem of scale also arises when we need to identify the appropriate timing (the
        temporal window) to detect strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between disease outbreaks and environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariates</ENAMEX>. This is particularly important when strong couplings between environment and
        transmission occur only transiently. This seems to be the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh</ENAMEX>,
        where couplings are strong during <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Niños</ENAMEX>, but considerably weaker the rest of the time
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Intermittent couplings provide insight into how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> might behave if pushed into
        specific dynamic regions by a change in climate. Intermittent couplings also suggest the
        existence of thresholds in the response to climate, an area of research that remains in
        need of quantitative approaches.
      
      
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seasonal</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drivers May Be Elusive</ENAMEX>
        Besides scale, specific seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are often elusive because of the simpler reason
        that in nature seasonality is ubiquitous. Multiple and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">covarying</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> have been proposed
        for the seasonal nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX>, including temperature, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX>, and plankton blooms
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Yet the specific roles of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> in the bimodal seasonal cycle of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX>, and
        particularly in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> peak in endemic regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south Asia</ENAMEX>, have not been
        convincingly shown (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. We still don't have predictive explanations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> variation in seasonal patterns. We won't find such explanations by considering
        the average seasonal pattern; instead, we must consider the anomalies in amplitude and
        onset of the peaks that occur in different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        Ecologists have considered seasonality in mathematical models of the population dynamics
        of infectious diseases. Models of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonally</TIMEX> forced, dynamic interactions
        (births, deaths, aggregation, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> transmission) reveal an array of possible
        responses, from simple <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> cycles, through cycles that repeat with longer periods, to
        irregular chaotic fluctuations. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> also predict intermittent switching between
        different dynamic infectious disease behaviors. But typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> consider only simple
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> forcing functions (mathematical functions that are periodic in time and therefore
        describe in a generic way the seasonal variation in the transmission rate or some other
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> parameter—a sine wave is an example). There are some important exceptions to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">this—some</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> do incorporate more complicated seasonal forcing functions that describe
        the actual processes underlying the seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> of transmission. Examples are models
        of childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that describe the regular stopping and starting of school terms
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10,11</NUMEX>], and recent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> models that include the seasonal dynamics of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mosquito</NUMEX> births
        and pathogen incubation as functions of temperature and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        The explicit way in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> treat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> may be critical in
        addressing the links between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within-year</TIMEX> seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> and those of longer period that
        are observed in many infectious diseases. For meningococcal meningitis, we still need to
        examine the connection between the seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        and the previously proposed role of humidity in inter-annual cycles [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complexity of Infectious Disease Dynamics</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' study is exceptional in that it illustrates a clear relationship
        between an external environmental variable and the initiation of disease outbreaks. In
        contrast, many studies seeking environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are plagued by the many confounding
        factors, particularly the impact that other components of global change have on the
        transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Thus, when we examine datasets for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>,
        we must also consider the evolution of drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> and a growing human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that
        is increasingly forced to live in areas that are marginal for agricultural production but
        optimal for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria transmission</ENAMEX>.
        Given this complexity, a serious limiting factor to quantitative analyses and predictive
        models of ecological and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> patterns is the lack of long-term disease records with
        similar data collected over a network of spatial locations. The handful of extremely
        valuable records that have allowed progress in understanding long-term patterns in disease
        dynamics pale in comparison to the spatiotemporal coverage available for climate studies
        and modeling. The need to resolve these issues of scale and confounding variability only
        underscores the urgency and importance of maintaining and developing systematic
        surveillance programs for infectious diseases around the world.
