        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to describe the recent explosion in our awareness and understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated
        gene silencing pathways. The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-mediated gene silencing</ENAMEX> is a
        double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (dsRNA) that is chopped into tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> by the enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicer</ENAMEX>. The tiny
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> associate with various silencing effector <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and attach to homologous target
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>) by basepairing. Depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> composition of the effector
        complex and the nature of the target sequence, the outcome can be either mRNA degradation,
        translational repression, or genome modification, all of which silence gene expression
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Present in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and many fungi, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated gene silencing
        pathways have essential roles in development, chromosome structure, and virus resistance.
        Although the mechanistic details are still under investigation, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-mediated silencing</ENAMEX> has
        already provided a powerful tool for studying gene function and spawned a fledgling
        industry that aims to develop novel RNA-based therapeutics to treat human diseases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson 2004).</ENAMEX>
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> first learned of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated gene silencing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> following the
        discovery, in the nematode <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> 
        Caenorhabditis elegans (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>), of a process called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi), in which dsRNA triggers sequence-specific mRNA degradation. The
        roots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated silencing, however, can be traced back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX>, when a handful of
        botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs stumbled</ENAMEX> across strange cases of gene silencing in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. To
        highlight the many seminal contributions of plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to the field, we offer here a
        personal perspective on the origins and history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated gene silencing in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early Silencing Phenomena</ENAMEX>
        Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> working with transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> found themselves
        confronted with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜bewildering arrayâ€™</ENAMEX> of unanticipated gene silencing phenomena
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martienssen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richards 1995).</ENAMEX> Most intriguing were cases in which silencing seemed to be
        triggered by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequence interactions</ENAMEX>, which could occur between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate
        transgenes that shared sequence homology or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and homologous plant gene.
        Several early examples supplied the prototypes for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated gene silencing
        that are recognized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type, silencing results from a block in mRNA synthesis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcriptional gene silencing</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX>]); in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type, silencing results from mRNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX> (posttranscriptional gene silencing [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX>]) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX> was revealed when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> were introduced in sequential
        steps into the tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> encoded different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but contained
        identical gene regulatory regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>). Unexpectedly, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        which was stably active on its own, often became silenced in the presence of the second
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the silenced transgenes acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation</ENAMEX>, a genome
        modification frequently associated with silencing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silencing</ENAMEX> and methylation were reversed
        when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene complexes segregated</ENAMEX> from each other in progeny, suggesting that
        interactions between the common promoter regions triggered silencing and methylation
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matzke et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> was discovered in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> involved experiments to evaluate antisense
        suppression, a promising approach at the time for selectively silencing plant gene
        expression. In theory, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antisense RNA encoded</ENAMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> should basepair to the
        complementary mRNA of a plant gene, preventing its translation into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Although the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control â€˜senseâ</ENAMEX>€™ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene RNAs</ENAMEX> are unable to basepair to mRNA and hence should not induce
        silencing, they often inexplicably did (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>). In another type of experiment,
        efforts to enhance floral coloration in petunia by overexpressing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene encoding</ENAMEX> a
        protein involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> synthesis led paradoxically to partial or complete loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This resulted from coordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">silencing (â€˜cosuppressionâ€™</ENAMEX>) of both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> and the homologous plant gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoli et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van der Krol et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>),
        later shown to occur at the posttranscriptional level (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Carvalho et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Blokland et al. 1994</ENAMEX>) A related phenomenon, called quelling, was observed in the
        filamentous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> 
        Neurospora crassa (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macino 1992).</ENAMEX> Similarly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> was often associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> methylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingelbrecht et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> influential papers appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reported the discovery of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-directed DNA methylation</ENAMEX> in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wassenegger et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>). This
        was the earliest demonstration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-induced modification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, a process that we return
        to below. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study showed that plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA viruses</ENAMEX> could be both initiators and targets
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX>. Plants expressing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene encoding</ENAMEX> a truncated viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coat protein</ENAMEX> became
        resistant to the corresponding virus, a state achieved by mutual degradation of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene mRNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindbo et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>). In addition to forging a link between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> virus
        resistance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX>, this study included a remarkably prescient model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> that
        featured an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (RDR), small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, and dsRNA, all of which were
        later found to be important for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> was subsequently shown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> to protect
        plants naturally from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covey et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ratcliff et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Transgene</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> thus tapped into a preexisting natural mechanism for combating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">viruses</ENAMEX>.
        To recap: by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1998â</NUMEX>€”the year in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> was reportedâ€”plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> had documented
        sequence-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA degradation</ENAMEX> (PTGS), sequence-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation</ENAMEX> that triggered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-directed DNA methylation</ENAMEX>. They had also proposed models for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> involving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dsRNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindbo et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metzlaff et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>), small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindbo et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>).
      
      
        RNAi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> was discovered in experiments designed to compare the silencing activity of
        single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> (ssRNAs) (antisense or sense) with their dsRNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX>. While only
        marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">silencing</ENAMEX> of a target gene was achieved after injecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> with the individual
        strands, injection of a senseâ€“antisense mixture resulted in potent and specific silencing
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). This unequivocally fingered dsRNA as the trigger of silencing. Shortly
        thereafter, dsRNA was shown to provoke gene silencing in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, including plants
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waterhouse et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). Indeed, the relatedness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX>, and quelling was confirmed
        when genetic analyses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurospora</ENAMEX> identified common components in the respective
        silencing pathways (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannon 2003).</ENAMEX> This included the aforementioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDR</ENAMEX>, which can
        synthesize dsRNA from ssRNA templates (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> is now accepted as the plant
        equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>.
        The discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> established a requirement for dsRNA in silencing, but details of
        the mechanism remained unclear. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> studying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> provided a crucial
        clue when they detected small (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 25 nucleotide-long</NUMEX>) RNAs corresponding to
        silenced target genes in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamilton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baulcombe 1999).</ENAMEX> They proposed
        that the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">RNAs</ENAMEX> provided the all-important specificity determinant for silencing.
        Consistent with this, a rapid succession of studies in 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> demonstrated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21â€“23</NUMEX> nucleotide â€˜short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interfering'RNAs</ENAMEX> (siRNAs), derived from cutting longer dsRNA, can guide mRNA cleavage
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zamore et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elbashir et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>); identified RISC (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-induced silencing
        complex), a nuclease that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> and executes target mRNA cleavage
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hammond et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>); and identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dicer</ENAMEX>, the enzyme that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chops dsRNA</ENAMEX> into short RNAs
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernstein et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi/PTGS</ENAMEX> was detected originally in experiments involving transgenes, injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX>. Did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> machinery also generate small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> gene regulation?
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, the newly discovered siRNAs were the same size as several â€˜small temporalâ€™
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, first identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> as important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of developmental timing in worms
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reinhart et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Everything came together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> when heroic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloning</ENAMEX> efforts unearthed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of natural small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21â€“25</NUMEX> nucleotides in length, first
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> and flies and later from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and mammals (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartel 2004).</ENAMEX> Similar to
        siRNAs, the natural small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, dubbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">microRNAs</ENAMEX> (miRNAs), arise from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dicer</ENAMEX> processing of
        dsRNA precursors and are incorporated into RISC (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannon 2003).</ENAMEX> In many cases,
        miRNAs effect silencing by basepairing to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX>€² ends of target mRNAs and repressing
        translation (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). miRNAs are now recognized as key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and animal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Identifying their target genes and full range of action are areas of intense
        research (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartel 2004).</ENAMEX>
        Up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi/PTGS</ENAMEX> and miRNAs were the most avidly studied aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated
        gene silencing. The next major advance, however, abruptly turned attention back to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-guided modifications of the genome. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> working on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-directed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methylation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGS</ENAMEX> had demonstrated a requirement for dsRNAs that are processed to
        short <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX>, reinforcing a mechanistic link to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTGS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mette et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sijen et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
        This established the principle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-guided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> modifications, but the generality of
        this process was uncertain because not all organisms methylate their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Widespread
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> came with the discovery in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAimediated</ENAMEX> heterchromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volpe et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). This silencing pathway uses short RNAs
        produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dicer</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> components to direct methylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (histones), thus generating condensed, transcriptionally silent chromosome regions
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">heterochromatin</NUMEX>) (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Targets of this pathway include centromeres, which are
        essential for normal chromosome segregation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX>-dependent heterochromatin pathway has
        been found in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zilberman et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pal</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhadra et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) and likely represents a
        general means for creating condensed, silent chromosome domains.
      
      
        More Lessons from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plants</ENAMEX>
        Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> can chalk up other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜firstsâ€™</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated gene silencing. Systemic
        silencing, in which a silencing signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">short</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or dsRNA) moves from cell to cell and
        through the vascular system to induce silencing at distant sites, was initially detected in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palauqui et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voinnet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baulcombe 1997) and</ENAMEX> later in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 1998</ENAMEX>), although not yet in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> or mammals. Viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that suppress silencing by
        disarming the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PTGS</ENAMEX>-based antiviral defense mechanism were discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> virologists
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anandalakshmi et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BÃ©clin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigneti et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasschau</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Carrington 1998</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p19 protein</ENAMEX> of tombusviruses, acts as a size-selective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caliper</ENAMEX> to sequester short RNAs from the silencing machinery (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vargason et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). A
        recent study suggests that animal viruses encode suppressors of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated silencing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2004</ENAMEX>).
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated gene silencing pathways are evolutionarily conserved, there are
        various elaborations in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. For example, the plant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dicer</ENAMEX>-like (DCL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, in contrast to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, whose genomes encode <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dicer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schauer et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RDR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> has also expanded in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> to include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. An
        important goal has been to determine the functions of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX>. Previous
        studies in 
        Arabidopsis have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DCL1</ENAMEX> is needed for processing miRNA
        precursors important for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant development</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reinhart et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), but
        not for siRNAs active in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnegan et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). The paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xie et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) in
        this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> delineates distinct functions for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DCL2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DCL3</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RDR2</TIMEX>.
        Nuclear-localized DCL3 acts with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RDR2</NUMEX> to generate short RNAs that elicit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and histone
        modifications; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DCL2</ENAMEX> produces short RNAs active in antiviral defense in the cytoplasm of
        cells. This study illustrates nicely how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> silencing components have diversified in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> to carry out specialized functions.
        By identifying small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAs</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of gene silencing that act at multiple levels
        throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> have created a new paradigm for eukaryotic gene
        regulation. Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have figured prominently in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>-mediated silencing research.
        Instrumental to their success was the early ability to produce large numbers of transgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, which displayed a rich variety of gene silencing phenomena that were amenable to
        analysis. The agricultural biotechnology industry provided incentives to find ways to
        stabilize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene expression</ENAMEX> and use transgenic approaches to modulate plant gene
        expression and to genetically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> virus resistance. As exemplified by the petunia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cosuppression</ENAMEX> experiments, nonessential plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigments</ENAMEX> provide conspicuous visual markers
        that vividly reveal gene silencing. The history of gene silencing research shows once again
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> offer outstanding experimental systems for elucidating general biological
        principles.
