        serious disease, and its etiology and epidemiology have been well documented. But the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX> to many, and it often goes undiagnosed, even in endemic areas. As
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of this chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains problematic, new preventive or therapeutic
        options are needed.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etiology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiology</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coccidioidomycosis</ENAMEX> is a fungal disease found only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX>. It is
        caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nearly identical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
        Coccidioides immitis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> posadasii , generically referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúCalifornian‚Äù</ENAMEX> and
        ‚Äúnon-Californian‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> respectively [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> grows in a mycelial phase (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Box</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in the soil within a geographically delineated area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> known as the
        Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonoran Life</ENAMEX> Zone [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. This semiarid zone encompasses the southern parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and much of central and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Endemic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> for coccidioidomycosis have long been identified in semiarid areas in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], and smaller endemic foci have been described in areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>]. More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> has also been found to contain endemic areas in the
        semiarid northeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The climatic conditions and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are similar to those in endemic regions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> has the largest number of reported cases, with the prevalence of
        infection in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> reported to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 10%‚Äì40%</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>]. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> posadasii is thought to be the predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        As the soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dries</ENAMEX> or nutrients become limiting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus reproduces</ENAMEX> asexually by
        disarticulating the hyphae into small, environmentally-resistant arthroconidia
        (reproductive spores) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). These are easily aerosolized when the soil is disturbed
        by wind or human activities. Consequently, it is the inhalation of the dust-borne
        arthroconidia that leads to infection by this pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and domestic
        or wild mammals. Upon inhalation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">converts</ENAMEX> to a unique life cycle of alternating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spherules</ENAMEX> and progeny endospores, which comprises the parasitic phase of this dimorphic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungus</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Mycelial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are only occasionally found in diseased tissue
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coccidioidomycosis</ENAMEX> is not contagious; reports of human-to-human spread are extremely
        rare. Hence, primary exposure to contaminated dust is the sole risk factor for the
        acquisition of this disease.
        It is estimated that upwards of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> primary coccidioidal infections occur in humans
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in the endemic areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the incidence of
        the disease has increased in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, which may be partially due to the
        rapid immigration of previously unexposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> outside the endemic areas (in
        other words, the pool of susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> has increased) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
        diagnosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have symptoms is established by serodiagnosis in conjunction with
        patient history. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">previous decades</TIMEX>, a coccidioidal skin test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> was a useful adjunct
        in the diagnosis, but it became unavailable in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1980s</NUMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The incidence of primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary disease</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is not established; most reports are limited to
        disseminated or unusual cases [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Diagnosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> is usually based on
        microbiologic findings, as serology is not always available [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Clinical Features
        In their pioneering epidemiologic studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60%</NUMEX> of
        exposures to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> result in asymptomatic infection [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">symptomatic disease</ENAMEX>, there are protean manifestations. These range from a primary, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">benign</ENAMEX>, pulmonary infection (commonly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúValley Fever‚Äù</ENAMEX>) to a progressive pulmonary
        or extrapulmonary disease involving the skin, bones and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>, the central nervous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, and other organ systems. Fortunately, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with primary disease recover
        spontaneously and retain lifelong immunity to exogenous reinfection. Chronic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disseminated disease</ENAMEX> is estimated to occur in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 5%</NUMEX> of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, with
        comparatively more cases occurring in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The most
        dangerous form of the disease is meningeal infection, which occurs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.15</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äì0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.75%</NUMEX> of
        extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis cases and requires treatment for life [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where tuberculosis rates are high, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> diseases may occur together.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuberculosis</ENAMEX> and coccidioidomycosis share common epidemiological, clinical, radiographic,
        and even histopathological features, making a correct diagnosis extremely difficult in
        cases where both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases coexist</ENAMEX>. In areas where both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> are endemic, the pertinent
        studies for diagnosing both conditions should be performed in every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with compatible
        clinical features. The diagnosis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them does not exclude the possible existence of
        the other [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Treatment
        Historically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the primary respiratory form of the disease were not treated
        because the vast majority recovered on their own. Instead, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were given
        supportive care and were monitored, often with radiographs, until the disease resolved. In
        recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, however, an increasing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are prescribing azole antifungals
        in cases of primary disease, both because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> like fluconazole have a good safety record,
        and because there is a perception that treatment may prevent progression to more serious
        forms of the disease. This latter presumption, however, is not supported by controlled
        trial data.
        All cases of chronic or disseminated disease call for antifungal therapy, but the choice
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, route, and duration of therapy is highly dependent on the form of the disease,
        the severity and site(s) of infection, and the immune status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galgiani</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have published clinical practice guidelines on the choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and duration
        of therapy for a given form of the disease [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> classes of antifungal therapy routinely used for treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coccidioidomycosis</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class is the polyenes, with amphotericin B desoxycholate and
        the newer lipid formulations used for the more serious forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class
        is the azoles, with ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and the newer analogue
        voriconazole as available options. Voriconazole, in particular, is being used more and more
        often in life-threatening mycoses, and was found to be better than amphotericin B in the
        primary therapy of invasive aspergillosis [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. According to available reports, treatment
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> usually consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the azoles (fluconazole or itraconazole) and/or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amphotericin</ENAMEX> B desoxycholate; lipid formulations are too costly to be accessible[<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        Treatment of the more serious or aggressive forms of the disease is typically of long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> and often results in less than complete resolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>; relapse is common
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Unfortunately, information on the treatment of coccidioidomycosis is limited, due to
        the small numbers of controlled trials performed for what is perceived to be a niche
        market. Clearly, newer, more powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are needed.
        In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, surgery is sometimes indicated to remove focalized infections,
        such as pulmonary cavities, or to debride osseous forms of the disease [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunology</ENAMEX> and the Basis for a Vaccine
        Acquired resistance to coccidioidomycosis strongly correlates with the development of a
        delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test response to coccidioidal antigens [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] and the
        production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-helper-1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Th1</NUMEX>)-associated cytokines to coccidioidal antigens, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN-Œ≥</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Interleukin-2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IL-2</NUMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. Humoral immunity plays no known
        role in overcoming infection.
        Although all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are equally susceptible to initial infection, there is evidence of
        genetic predisposition to dissemination, independent of socioeconomic or environmental
        factors, particularly among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Filipinos</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Pregnancy is also a risk
        factor.
        In cases of marked immunosuppression, either in advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> or other forms of
        depressed cellular immunity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of coccidioidomycosis is particularly
        challenging and requires aggressive treatment [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
        As previously mentioned, recovery from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> confers lifelong immunity to reinfection,
        and is a rationale for the development and implementation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> for the prevention
        of symptomatic or serious forms of the disease. The combination of increasing incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, a growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the endemic area, and the lack of a highly effective drug
        treatment justifies efforts to prevent (rather than treat) this disease. To that end, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university-based</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Valley Fever Vaccine</ENAMEX> Project (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valleyfever</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>), has
        identified and cloned immunogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have proven effective in the prevention of
        deaths and fungal burdens in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models of coccidioidomycosis. This suggests that a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> could be created [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> vaccine comprised of a fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antigens</ENAMEX> has been selected and is currently in pharmaceutical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> under the sponsorship of this project, with the goal of evaluating the safety
        and immunogenicity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Although the vast majority of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> emerge from coccidioidomycosis
        without complications, an unlucky minority are faced with a debilitating disease that lacks
        adequate drug options for rapid and completely effective treatment. In the absence of newer
        therapeutics, discoveries that lead to immunologic intervention [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] or prevention by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vaccines</ENAMEX> may ultimately bring a measure of relief.
