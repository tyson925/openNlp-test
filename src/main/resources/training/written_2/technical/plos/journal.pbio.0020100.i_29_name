        artificial surfaces and exhibiting membrane ruffles and protrusions. However, while I found
        cultured cells fascinating I always wondered how cells are able to move and regulate their
        shape in the context of a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> where so many space constraints exist and where
        all cellular processes have to be tightly regulated. Some answers to my questions began to
        emerge in a paper written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perrimon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>), in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> showed the
        expression and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">actin binding proteins</ENAMEX> in a real
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX>.
        The cytoskeleton is a meshwork of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein polymers extending</ENAMEX> throughout the cytoplasm.
        It not only provides structural support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> but also plays a central role in a
        range of dynamic processes from signalling to endocytosis and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">intracellular</ENAMEX> trafficking. A
        particularly clear example of this is the use of actin cytoskeleton as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“wool”</ENAMEX> for
        knitting multiple dynamic structures such as lamellae, filopodia, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress fibres</ENAMEX>. These
        structures determine cell shape and also produce the driving force accompanying many types
        of cellular movements including muscle contraction and cell division. We know many details
        about some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that modulate the dynamics of actin in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        However, most of them have been found biochemically and their function has been elucidated
        primarily using in vitro and cell culture assays of actin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. What about these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the context of a developing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>? How do cells generate a spatially and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temporally</ENAMEX> ordered network of actin filaments represented at the tissue level? To answer
        these questions, we need to move to experimentally accessible multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, such
        as 
        Drosophila , which offers virtually unlimited possibilities as a
        model system for the genetic and molecular analysis of biological processes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perrimon</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) analyzed the function of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in actin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> within the context of a developing epithelium—the follicle cells that surround the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germ</ENAMEX> line cyst during 
        Drosophila oogenesis. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have a simple polarised
        arrangement of actin filaments, which provides a useful system to study the spatial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organisation</ENAMEX> of the actin cytoskeleton.
        Taking advantage of the ability to generate clones of cells lacking specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> identified new functional roles for actin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> (a 
        Drosophila homologue of adenylyl cyclase-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enabled</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ena</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abelson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abl</ENAMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> had been well characterized in cell culture
        and in vitro studies, but little was known about their function in a developing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
        Clones of cells lacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> known to inhibit actin polymerisation,
        maintained their epithelial polarity but had higher levels of actin and defects in the
        apical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">actin organisation</ENAMEX>. This result indicates that the inhibitory activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> is
        restricted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the cells, thus demonstrating that actin dynamics can be
        independently modified at opposite poles of an epithelium. Ena, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the Ena/VASP
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that catalyse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament</ENAMEX> formation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abl</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinase</ENAMEX> that binds CAP
        in mammalian cells, were found to work with CAP in this process. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> proposed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ena</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abl</ENAMEX> regulate the level and spatial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of actin in the follicle
        cells.
        In contrast to the spatially restricted functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ena</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abl</ENAMEX>, profilin and
        cofilin were shown to regulate actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filament</ENAMEX> formation throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell cortex</ENAMEX>, a more
        global function that matches the results obtained in cell culture experiments. In summary,
        this study showed how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can organise actin in space and began to highlight some of
        the differences and similarities between cells in culture and in vivo. The functions
        revealed in the follicular epithelium were consistent with the roles previously shown in
        mammalian systems, but the experiments on intact tissue began to reveal a spatial and
        temporal functional dimension that could not have been observed in cell culture.
        These experiments could be expanded to large-scale screens (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Johnston 2002)</ENAMEX>, but this
        would be time consuming and could encounter the problem that some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will be cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lethal</ENAMEX>, preventing the analysis of their function in actin dynamics. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more
        recent reports (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiger et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) describe a complementary and
        exhaustive search for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of cytoskeletal dynamics by taking advantage of genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> and the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA interference</ENAMEX> (RNAi) technique (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutvágner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zamore 2002).</ENAMEX>
        RNAi allows individual genes to be knocked out in a simple and controlled fashion.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiger et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNAi</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different cell lines of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> to screen a number of genes involved in signalling
        and cytoskeletal dynamics. They targeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">994</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> produced phenotypes in the
        experiment. The range of phenotypes varied from specific defects in the actin and tubulin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> to others affecting cell cycle progression, cytokinesis, and cell shape. They
        also showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 40%</NUMEX> of the genes had similar loss-of-function phenotypes in
        both cell lines. This alone indicates an important limitation of many tissue culture
        experiments, since the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can have different effects depending on the cell type.
        Another valuable element of this work is that clustering of genes with similar phenotypes
        leads to the identification of pathways and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of genes that are involved in
        cytoskeletal function.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), using only one 
        Drosophila cell line, studied the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved
        in the formation of lamellae. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> looked at the effects of loss of function in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX>
        genes known to be involved in actin dynamics and the formation and activity of the lamella.
        As well as confirming the function of many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> already known to play a role in this
        process, this analysis allowed them to find interactions between genes and to build genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>.
        Together these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> screens in tissue culture can be a powerful
        tool for finding new functions of known and uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and new relationships
        between genes. However, this is only the beginning, and the genes identified in this manner
        will have to be tested in vivo, in systems like that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perrimon</ENAMEX>, where specific
        functions can be assessed in time and space within the confines of real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The
        focus must be to understand how all these molecular events and regulation cascades operate
        in individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to contribute to the generation of changes in a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.
        Increasingly, the attention of developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> is being drawn from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their
        products towards cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaltschmidt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinez Arias</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). The future, it seems to me,
        lies in the combination of in vitro systems, cell culture, and in vivo studies. I hope to
        apply this view in my analysis of the process of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">dorsal</TIMEX> closure in 
        Drosophila embryos, as an example of how signalling pathways
        coordinate and regulate the activity of the cytoskeleton in the generation of shape and
        morphogenetic movements (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jacinto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">et al.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
