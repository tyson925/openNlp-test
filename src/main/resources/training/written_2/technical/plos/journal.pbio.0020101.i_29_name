        of violence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. I do not just mean the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> news, even though it is
        hard getting used to multiple murders per day in any large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. No, I mean sitcoms,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">comedies</ENAMEX>, drama series, and movies. Staying away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwarzenegger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stallone</ENAMEX> does not
        do it; almost any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> movie features violence. Inevitably, desensitization sets in. If
        you say, for example, that 
        Dances with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Wolves</ENAMEX> (the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> movie with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX>) is violent, people
        look at you as if you are crazy. They see an idyllic, sentimental movie, with beautiful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landscapes</ENAMEX>, showing a rare white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who respects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Indians</ENAMEX>. The bloody scenes
        barely register.
        Comedy is no different. I love, for example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saturday Night Live</ENAMEX> for its inside commentary on peculiarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenomena</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cheerleaders</ENAMEX>, televangelists, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity lawyers</ENAMEX>. But 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNL</ENAMEX> is incomplete without at least one sketch in which someone's car
        explodes or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> gets blown off. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Characters</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franz (‚</ENAMEX>ÄúWe're going to pump
        you up<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">!‚Äù</NUMEX>) appeal to me for their names alone (and yes, I do have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans</ENAMEX>), but
        when their free weights are so heavy that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> get torn off, I am baffled. The
        spouting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> gets a big laugh from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, but I fail to see the humor.
        Did I grow up in a land of sissies? Perhaps, but I am not mentioning this to decide
        whether violence in the media and our ability to grow immune to it‚Äîas I also have over the
        years‚Äîis desirable, or not. I simply wish to draw attention to the cultural fissures in how
        violence is portrayed, how we teach conflict resolution, and whether harmony is valued over
        competitiveness. This is the problem with the human species. Somewhere in all of this
        resides a human nature, but it is molded and stretched into so many different directions
        that it is hard to say if we are naturally competitive or naturally community<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-builders</ENAMEX>. In
        fact, we are both, but each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX> reaches its own balance between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>,
        the squeaky wheel gets the grease. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, the nail that stands out gets pounded into the
        ground.
        Does this variability mean, as some have argued, that animal studies cannot possibly
        shed light on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aggression</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúNature</ENAMEX>, red in tooth and claw‚Äù remains the dominant image
        of the animal world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> just fight, and that is it? It is not that simple. First, each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> has its own way of handling conflict, with for example the chimpanzee (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan</ENAMEX> troglodytes ) being far more violent than that equally close
        relative of ours, the bonobo (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. paniscus</ENAMEX> ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Waal 1997).</ENAMEX> But also within each species we
        find, just as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, variation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcultures‚Äù</ENAMEX> of violence
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcultures‚Äù</ENAMEX> of peace. The latter are made possible by the universal primate ability to
        settle disputes and iron out differences.
        There was a time when no review of human nature would be complete without assertions
        about our inborn aggressiveness. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> to bring up this issue, not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coincidentally</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konrad Lorenz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenz</ENAMEX>'s thesis was greeted
        with accusations about attempts to whitewash human atrocities, all the more so given the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s native tongue, which was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenz</ENAMEX> was hardly alone. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>, science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Ardrey</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>) presented us as ‚Äúkiller apes‚Äù unlikely to ever
        get our nasty side under control. Recent world events have done little to counter this
        pessimistic outlook.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> argued, of course, that aggression, like all human behavior, is subject
        to powerful cultural influences. They even signed petitions to this effect, such as the
        controversial 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seville Statement on Violence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams et al. 1990).</ENAMEX> In the polarized
        mind-set of the time, the issue was presented in either-or fashion, as if behavior cannot
        be both learned and built upon a biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>. This rather fruitless
        nature/nurture debate becomes considerably more complex if we include what is usually left
        out, which is the ability to keep aggression under control and foster peace. For this
        ability, too, there exist animal parallels, such as the habit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chimpanzees</ENAMEX> to reconcile
        after fights by means of a kiss and embrace. Such reunions are well-documented in a
        multitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, including nonprimates, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hyenas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>. They serve to
        restore social relationships disturbed by aggression, and any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> that depends on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cooperation</ENAMEX> needs such mechanisms of social repair (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aureli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">de Waal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Waal 2000).</ENAMEX>
        There are even indications that in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, too, cultural influences matter in this regard.
        This may disturb those who write culture with a capital 
        C , and hence view it as uniquely human, but it is a serious possibility
        nonetheless.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nonhuman</ENAMEX> culture is currently one of the hottest areas in the study of animal behavior.
        The idea goes back to the pioneering work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinji Imanishi</ENAMEX>, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX> proposed that if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> learn from one another, their behavior may over time grow different from that
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, thus creating a characteristic culture
        (reviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Waal 2001).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imanishi</ENAMEX> thus brought the culture concept down to its most
        basic feature, that is, the social rather than genetic transmission of behavior. Since
        then, many examples have been documented, mostly concerning subsistence techniques, such as
        the sweet potato washing of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> macaques (
        Macaca fuscata ) and the rich array of tool use by wild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chimpanzees</ENAMEX>, orangutans (
        Pongo pymaeus ), and capuchin <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> (
        Cebus spp.) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whiten et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Waal</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hirata et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> et al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Schaik et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> However, much less attention has been
        paid to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> culture , which we might define as the transmission of social
        positions, preferences, habits, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> culture is obviously harder to document than tool use. In human culture, for
        instance, it is easy to tell if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> eat with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX> and fork or with chopsticks, but to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> if a culture is egalitarian or hierarchical, warm or distant, collectivistic or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">individualistic</ENAMEX> takes time and is difficult to capture in behavioral measures. A
        well-documented <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> example of social culture is the inheritance of rank positions in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macaque</ENAMEX> and baboon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>. The future position in the hierarchy of a newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> can
        be predicted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost one hundred</NUMEX> percent certainty on the basis of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s rank.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in high places are born with a silver spoon in their mouth, so to
        speak, whereas those of lowly origin will spend their life at the bottom. Despite its
        stability, the system depends on learning. Early in life, the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> finds out
        against which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> it can expect help from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>. When sparring with
        peer A she may utter screams that recruit massive support to defeat A. But against peer B
        she can scream her lungs out and nothing happens. Consequently, she will come to dominate A
        but not B. Experiments manipulating the presence of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have found that when
        support dwindles dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are unable to maintain their positions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapais 1988).</ENAMEX> In
        other words, the kin-based hierarchy is maintained for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> rather than genetic transmission.
        Returning to the issue of aggressive behavior, here the effects of social culture can be
        felt as well. Without any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> or brain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, one experiment managed to turn monkeys
        into pacifists. Juveniles of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different macaque <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were placed together, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months</TIMEX>. Rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> (
        Macaca mulatta ), known as quarrelsome and violent, were housed
        with the more tolerant and easy-going <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stumptail monkeys</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. arctoides</ENAMEX> ) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Stumptail monkeys easily reconcile
        with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> after fights by holding each others' hips (the so-called ‚Äúhold-bottom‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ritual</ENAMEX>), whereas reconciliations are rare in rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>. Because the mixed-species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were dominated by the stumptails, physical aggression was rare. The atmosphere was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relaxed</ENAMEX>, and after a while all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. Juveniles of the two species
        played together, groomed together, and slept in large, mixed huddles. Most importantly, the
        rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> developed peacemaking skills on a par with those of their more tolerant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group mates</ENAMEX>. Even when, at the end of the experiment, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were separated, the
        rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> still showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times more reconciliation and grooming behaviors after
        fights than typical of their kind (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Waal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johanowicz 1993).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primates</ENAMEX> thus can adopt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> behavior under the influence of others, which opens the door to social culture.
        Not unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhesus monkeys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baboons</ENAMEX> have a reputation for fierce competition and nasty
        fights. With the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Sapolsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lisa</ENAMEX> Share published in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> , we now have the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> field evidence that primates can go
        the flower power route (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapolsky</ENAMEX> and Share <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Wild baboons developed an exceptionally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pacific</ENAMEX> social tradition that outlasted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who established it. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapolsky</ENAMEX> has documented how olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">baboons</ENAMEX> (
        Papio anubis ) on the plains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masai Mara</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, wage
        wars of nerves, compromising their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>' immune systems and pushing up the level of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood cortisol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sapolsky 1994).</ENAMEX> An accident of history, however, selectively wiped out all
        the male bullies of his main study troop. As a result, the number of aggressive incidents
        dropped dramatically. This by itself was not so surprising. It became more interesting when
        it was discovered that the behavioral change was maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>. Baboon males
        migrate after puberty, hence fresh young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> enter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> all the time, resulting in a
        complete turn-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> during the intervening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>. Nevertheless, compared with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> around it, the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troop</ENAMEX> upheld its reduced aggression, increased friendly
        behavior, and exceptionally low stress levels. The conclusion from this natural experiment
        is that, like human societies, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> society has its own ecological and behavioral
        history, which determines its prevalent social style.
        It is somewhat ironic that at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> on human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggression</ENAMEX> are
        increasingly attracted, albeit with a far more sophisticated approach, to the Lorenzian
        idea of a biological basis of aggression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Enserink 2000</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> of animal behavior are
        beginning to look at its possible cultural basis. There is no reason for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with a
        development as slow as a baboon (with adulthood achieved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or six years</TIMEX>) not to be
        influenced in every way by the environment in which they grow up, including the social
        environment. How this influence takes place is a point of much debate, and remains unclear
        in the case of the peaceful male baboons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masai Mara</ENAMEX>. Given their mobility, the males
        themselves are unlikely transmitters of social traditions within their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natal troop</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapolsky</ENAMEX> and Share look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> for an answer‚Äîfemale baboons stay all
        their lives in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troop</ENAMEX>. By reacting positively to certain kinds of behavior, for
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> may be able to steer male attitudes in a new direction. This complex
        problem is hard to unravel with a single study, especially in the absence of
        experimentation. Yet, the main <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points of this discovery are loud and clear: social
        behavior observed in nature may be a product of culture, and even the fiercest primates do
        not forever need to stay this way.
        Let us hope this applies to humanity as well.
