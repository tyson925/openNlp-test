        the social domain, which is perhaps also a major reason for our relative evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. Our social skills are already being honed in childhood and early adolescence, when
        we quickly become very adept at forming and breaking alliances within and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> groups
        and spend much of our time engaged in complex social interactions. At best, these
        interactions enrich our society; at worst, they become ‘Machiavellian’ and exploitative.
        While science might appear removed from such politics, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> would probably agree
        that science is in fact a social enterprise, sharing many characteristics with other human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pursuits</ENAMEX>, and that any claim to greater scientific truth can only be accorded over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>,
        even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
        I have always been fascinated by social intelligence, particularly of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‘Machiavellian’ kind</ENAMEX>, and found myself wondering at the start of my doctoral research how
        one might use neuroimaging to study social intelligence in the human brain. I was also
        interested by the fact that some of this flexible behaviour is shared with other primates
        such as chimps, bonobos, and even monkeys, who also spend inordinate amounts of time in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> interactions, working out social hierarchies. However, it was not immediately
        obvious how one might go about designing experiments that would address these somewhat
        intangible issues of social behaviour.
        Trawling the scientific literature, I came across the concept of reversal learning.
        While it is obviously important that we can learn arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between stimuli
        and actions, it is also extremely important that we can relatively easily break these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> and learn others. If we learn that choosing a certain object leads to a
        reward, it would be rather maladaptive to keep choosing this object when it was no longer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a reward but, say, a punishment instead. In order to accommodate complex
        behaviour, we need to be able to adapt or reverse the learning patterns when things
        change.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>, it was thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> behaviour depended crucially on the
        prefrontal cortex of the brain, but it was not clear which parts were important for
        reversal learning. This was investigated in a classic paper by the eminent neuroscientists
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Iversen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortimer Mishkin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>), who studied <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, with elegant and
        important results. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> lesioned discrete parts of the prefrontal cortex in
        different monkeys and showed convincingly that these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> had differential effects on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>' ability to reverse rewarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> in an object reversal task. When the
        inferior prefrontal convexity and parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral orbitofrontal cortex</ENAMEX> (which is the
        ventral part of the prefrontal cortex over the orbits) (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were lesioned, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monkeys</ENAMEX> became significantly impaired with respect to object reversal learning.
        Specifically, they continued to respond much longer than controls to an object that was no
        longer rewarded on the first reversal trial.
        This was not the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> who had had the medial parts of the orbitofrontal
        cortex lesioned. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> were not completely unaffected by the lesion, but showed
        moderate impairment on all but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the object discrimination reversals.
        Furthermore, they had moderate difficulty withholding response between trials on an
        auditory differentiation task. These results strongly suggested a differential role for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> and medial parts of the orbitofrontal cortex.
        Although the paper was not published in a high-profile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, this elegant and very
        significant result has had a huge influence on subsequent research. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, like many
        other great papers, was ahead of its time, and it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a decade</TIMEX> before the citations
        started to pick up (at last online count, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1, 2004</TIMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISI</ENAMEX> database, the
        paper had generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX> citations since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iversen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mishkin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>) persuasively demonstrated the importance of the orbitofrontal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cortex</ENAMEX> in reversal learning, and other studies have since extended this result in nonhuman
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primates</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study demonstrated that single neurons in the macaque orbitofrontal cortex
        change their responses to a visual cue after a single trial in which the reward association
        of the visual cue is reversed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorpe et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). Another lesion study in marmosets by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dias et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) found that the orbitofrontal cortex is essential for the performance of
        emotion-related reversal learning tasks.
        There was also some evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to the orbitofrontal cortex have
        problems with reversal learning, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, caused by neurological insult, were not
        very clean or focal (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>). In addition, it had also become clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>
        to the orbitofrontal cortex were associated with impairments in emotional and social
        behaviour, characterised by disinhibition, social inappropriateness, and irresponsibility
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>).
        These interesting but nonconclusive results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> spurred us on to use neuroimaging
        on a modified version of a probabilistic reversal learning task designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Hornak</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John O'Doherty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hornak et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), whose preliminary data suggested that patients
        with surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to the orbitofrontal cortex were impaired. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' task was to
        determine, by trial and error, which of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stimuli was the more profitable to choose and
        to keep track of this, reversing their choice when a reversal occurred. By design, the
        actual reversal event was not easy to determine, since ‘money’ could be won or lost on both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimuli</ENAMEX>, but a choice of the rewarding stimulus would in general give larger rewards and
        smaller punishments. The converse was true of the punishing stimulus; losing a large amount
        of money would often (but not always) signal that a reversal had occurred.
        We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that dissociable activity in the
        medial orbitofrontal cortex was correlated with the magnitude of the monetary gains
        received, while activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral orbitofrontal cortex</ENAMEX> was correlated with the
        monetary losses incurred (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">O'Doherty et al. 2001</ENAMEX>). This dissociation between the functions
        of medial and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral orbitofrontal cortex</ENAMEX> seemed to mirror <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iversen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mishkin</ENAMEX>'s initial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissociation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral orbitofrontal cortex</ENAMEX> was linked, in both
        cases, to the reversal trials. However, owing to the probabilistic nature of the task, in
        which receiving a monetary punishment did not always signal reversal, our imaging study did
        not reveal the cortical localisation of reversal trials. In addition, our task used money
        as the secondary reinforcer, which might be a powerful influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> but has little
        biological relevance for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and certainly none in the social domain that I was
        interested in.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to solve these problems was to use facial expressions rather than money as the
        reinforcing stimuli. This made sense, given that the key to social intelligence is the
        ability to detect subtle changes in communication and act upon these changes rapidly as
        they occur. Such changes in social behaviour are often based on facial expression and come
        so naturally to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> (and are in place so early in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development) that some might
        argue that this functionality is essentially innate. However, our human social behaviour is
        sufficiently flexible that we can easily learn to adapt our behaviour to most facial
        expressions. For example, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s neutral expressions do not normally indicate that
        our behaviour should change, but it is easy to think of social contexts in which a neutral
        expression does indeed imply that our current behaviour is inappropriate and should
        change.
        I designed a reversal task in which the subject's overall goal was to keep track of the
        mood of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> presented in a pair and, as much as possible, to select the ‘happy’
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, who would then smile. Over time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with the ‘happy’ mood (who would smile
        when selected), changed his/her mood to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‘angry’</ENAMEX>. This person thus no longer smiled when
        selected, but instead changed to a facial expression that signalled that he/she should no
        longer be selected. In the main reversal task, the facial expression used to cue reversal
        was an angry expression (the most natural facial expression to cue reversal), while in the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, control, version of the reversal task, a neutral expression was used. By using two
        different reversal tasks in which different facial expressions signalled that behaviour
        must change, we were able to determine which brain areas were specific to general reversal
        learning, rather than just to reversal following a particular expression, such as
        anger.
        We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the ability to change
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviour</ENAMEX> based on facial expression is not reflected in the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fusiform</ENAMEX> face
        area (which invariably appears to reflect only identity and not valence), but that general
        reversal learning is specifically correlated with activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral orbitofrontal</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">anterior cingulate/paracingulate</ENAMEX> cortices (as well as other brain areas, including the
        ventral striatum and the inferior precentral sulcus) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kringelbach</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rolls 2003</ENAMEX>).
        This result confirmed and extended the results from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iversen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mishkin</ENAMEX>'s original
        paper. Further confirmation came from the neuropsychological testing, carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia</ENAMEX>
        Hornak on human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to the orbitofrontal cortex, which showed
        that bilateral (but not unilateral) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral orbitofrontal cortex</ENAMEX> produce
        significant impairments in reversal learning (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hornak et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Yet, as always, these
        results are not conclusive and raise many new issues. It is, for instance, not presently
        clear what other areas of the brain are necessary and sufficient for reversal learning.
        Among the other brain areas we found relating to general reversal learning in our study,
        the ventral striatum is, for instance, an obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cools et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). In
        addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging is essentially a correlative technique,
        with poor temporal information, which makes it very difficult to infer causal relations
        between brain regions. Thus, further investigations, e.g., with magnetoencephalography,
        will still be required to gain temporal information on the milliseconds scale. I take heart
        from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, a very distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, who states that the price for having spent a
        lifetime in cutting-edge research is that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of his (and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>') research is
        wrong—perhaps not completely wrong, but certainly wrong in the details. I would like to
        think that the original result from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iversen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mishkin</ENAMEX> paper is among the rare <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>, but
        the trouble with such foresight is that it lacks the vantage point of true hindsight.
        In his masterpiece, 
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niccolò Machiavelli</ENAMEX> offers a rather pessimistic view on
        human nature, in which ‘love is held by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of obligation which, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are bad, is
        broken at every opportunity for personal gain’. It may be that our capacity for rapid
        reversal learning is sometimes used for less than noble pursuits, both in science and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">interpersonal</ENAMEX> relations in general, but we would be in real trouble if we couldn't learn to
        change.
