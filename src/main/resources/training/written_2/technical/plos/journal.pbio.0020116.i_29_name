  
    
      
        
        We are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Council on Bioethics</ENAMEX>. In late
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, we were invited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to serve on this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bioethics Council</ENAMEX> was appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúmonitor stem-cell research, to
        recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations, and to consider all of the medical and
        ethical ramifications of biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">innovation‚Ä¶</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> will keep us apprised of new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developments</ENAMEX> and give our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> a forum to continue to discuss and evaluate these
        important issues.‚Äù
        This was a difficult invitation to accept. On the one hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s views on the
        use of human embryonic stem cell research and somatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> nuclear transfer techniques were
        well-known and in conflict with our own beliefs about the costs and benefits of the use of
        progressive technologies to advance biomedical research. On the other hand, we were
        grateful that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, despite his views in opposition to these therapies, was
        willing to invite serious biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to help formulate advice to him‚Äîand
        ultimately to contribute to the development of national policy‚Äîon these critically
        important advances.
        We knew that on this originally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-member (but for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</TIMEX> a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-member) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> we would be in the minority in our belief of the good to
        be gained through these and other areas of biomedical research. We were also aware that
        some others on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> had strong opposing views. Thus, it was only with the assurances
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Kass</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>, and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> himself that we were persuaded that our voices would be heard and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> into the statements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, we felt, and continue to feel,
        that bioethical issues are important not only to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, but also to society at
        large, and thus especially worthy of engaging debate and discussion.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recently issued reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúBeyond Therapy</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biotechnology</ENAMEX> and the
        Pursuit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Happiness‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://bioethics.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/reports/beyondtherapy/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúMonitoring Stem Cell Research‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://bioethics.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/reports/stemcell/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>), are
        therefore of deep concern to us. We discuss them in turn below.
      
      
        Concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúBeyond Therapy‚Äù Report</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúBeyond Therapy‚</ENAMEX>Äù report deals with issues of direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for every thoughtful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. However, in the interests of setting straight the record of our views, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, on the content of this report and for a proper assessment of the
        scientific content of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúBeyond Therapy‚</ENAMEX>Äù report, we feel it is important to point out
        aspects of the report for which we had requested revisions and for which those requests
        were declined.
        In the discussions of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, the specter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> babies
        is raised by implying that selecting embryos for intelligence and other traits, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperament</ENAMEX> is a possibility. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scientifically</ENAMEX>, this simply is highly unlikely and indeed may
        not even be feasible. While such scientific unlikelihood is mentioned in passing in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, it is easy to take away from the report the feeling that such genetic manipulation
        will happen and is even imminent.
        The report also claims that ‚Äúthe underlying impulse driving age-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> research is,
        at least implicitly, limitless, the equivalent of a desire for immortality.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Furthermore</ENAMEX>,
        the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX> of the report, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúAgeless Bodies</ENAMEX>,‚Äù implies that immortality is the
        goal of this research, despite all reliable scientific evidence to the contrary. Such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> is not consistent with the knowledge, stated in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, that there is no
        scientific basis for immortality and implies that, by seeking to maintain and extend
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúyouth</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äù</ENAMEX> research into aging, including stem cell research, is predominantly to serve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vanity</ENAMEX>. Also, without presenting scientific or reliable evidence, the report presents the
        opinion that research into prolonging healthy life may result in a lifetime obsession with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immortality</ENAMEX>. Hence, this chapter in the report falls short of explaining the serious
        challenge of preventing and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">curing age-related disease</ENAMEX> to extend health‚Äîvery different from
        attempting immortality.
        The same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> offers a sensational quote from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> that ‚Äúthe real goal [of
        aging research] is to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> alive forever.‚Äù The request that quotes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the biomedical research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> also be included was declined.
        This leads to a misleading misrepresentation of the motivation of reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in
        the field of aging.
        In suggesting that slowing biological aging may increase the disjunction <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between ‚</NUMEX>Äúsocial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aging‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age</TIMEX> at which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúadult‚Äù images and concepts) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúbiological aging‚Äù</ENAMEX> (expected lifespan), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> view, a conservative <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, of the supposed
        ‚Äúbest‚Äù way to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is presented. The report also suggests, with no clear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reasoning behind it</ENAMEX>, that longer lives will somehow undermine human determination to
        contribute as much as one can during a lifetime. Despite requests for inclusion of material
        that would allow for a balanced treatment of these topics, the report minimized discussion
        of potential positive aspects of slowing biological aging, such as prolonged good
        health.
        Finally, the report repeatedly emphasizes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúprofound</ENAMEX> and mysterious‚Äù link between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">longevity</ENAMEX> and fertility, thereby leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> with the distinct but erroneous
        impression that anything done to extend healthy life will be traded for decreased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertility</ENAMEX>, despite the fact that current scientific literature, which was made available
        for inclusion in the report, shows a 
        lack of any necessary 
        mechanistic linkage of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúMonitoring Stem Cell Research‚Äù Report</ENAMEX>
        With respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúMonitoring Stem Cell Research‚</ENAMEX>Äù report, we feel that some facts that
        would help the public and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> better assess the content of the report were not
        brought out clearly or were omitted entirely. First, from the published scientific
        literature in peer-reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> on stem cells, a major message can be distilled:
        namely, the vast difference that currently exists in our understanding of, and the
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of, embryonic versus adult stem cells as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of material for research
        and clinical purposes. In brief, human stem cells have been isolated from a variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">embryonic</ENAMEX>, fetal, and adult tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. However, enormous differences exist in purity,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, data reproducibility, and understanding of cells from these different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
        Much of our ignorance is related to the relative paucity of funding for research using
        embryonic stem cells.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years</TIMEX> of rigorous and careful research in animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have documented that embryonic
        stem cells have great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for scientific studies. This work has also rigorously and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibly</ENAMEX> established the great plasticity of these cells and supports the opinion that
        human embryonic stem cells possess the greatest broadest potential and promise for clinical
        applications. As well as therapeutic uses, important potential applications include studies
        of embryonic stem <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> bearing complex genotypes susceptible to poorly understood common
        human diseases and testing and screening drug efficacy.
        The report does not make clear that the best-characterized adult stem cells are
        hematopoietic stem cells. Currently, major difficulties and inadequate understanding exist
        with most other types of adult stem cells reported to date. In addition, many experiments
        suggesting that adult stem cells have broad plasticity may be incorrectly interpreted owing
        to an error caused by an experimental artifact of cell fusion present in some unknown
        proportion of the experiments. Research on some of the reported adult stem cell
        preparations may conceivably in the future demonstrate that they, too, like hematopoietic
        stem cells, can also be prospectively identified, ‚Äúsingle cell cloned,‚Äù expanded
        considerably by growth in vitro with retention of normal chromosome structure and number,
        and preserved by freezing and storage at low temperatures. But it should be strongly
        cautioned that this has not been done for most adult stem cell preparations, and, even if
        possible, it is not clear that any of the just-mentioned procedures will be accomplished in
        the near future, owing to the technically very demanding nature of such experiments.
        We feel it is important to emphasize a point that the report mentioned, that the
        reported isolation and properties of multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) must be
        reproduced in additional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> for any reliable interpretation of the results
        reported with these cells. After considerable effort, this has still not been achieved.
        Thus, in the reported results, the possible significance of the reported isolation and
        properties of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAPCs</ENAMEX> is left unclear, as is their potential as a source of stem cells
        for clinical purposes. Hence, a strong overall caution is that many of the reports on the
        properties of cells differentiated from adult stem cell preparations are to date
        preliminary and incomplete. If results with any isolated and characterized adult stem cells
        are validated, it will then be very important to compare their properties‚Äîand those of any
        more differentiated cells that can be derived from them‚Äîwith other stem cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, such
        as the well-characterized hematopoietic stem cells, and with human embryonic stem cell
        preparations.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> major considerations argue strongly for non-commercial, federal, peer-reviewed
        funding to be made available for this work. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is the sustained effort this work
        will require. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the importance of reliable and unbiased design of experiments
        and of open, public availability of the complete findings.
      
      
        Reasons for Our Concern
        In being concerned about the content of these reports, neither of which makes any
        recommendations for legislative or policy actions, are we worrying too much? We think not.
        Indeed, already, sadly as a result of the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> on aging research in the report
        were written, the myth that longevity has an inevitable tradeoff of diminished fertility is
        now gaining a further foothold: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 26, 2004</TIMEX>, issue of the 
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Republic</ENAMEX> . In it, an article about this report of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>
        falls right into the trap: it states, ‚ÄúBut changes come with longer life. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Worms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        that are altered for extended lifespans become sterile, or barely reproduce.‚Äù The public is
        done a disservice when science is presented incompletely; myths are then perpetuated.
        This is but one example of the dangers that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Gazzaniga</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dartmouth College</ENAMEX>) pointed out,
        in a Commentary within the edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúBeyond Therapy‚</ENAMEX>Äù report published by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2003</TIMEX>. In that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Commentary</ENAMEX>, we stated that ‚ÄúOur <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> ‚Ä¶ is that,
        moving forward, the debate carry on with all of the scientific evidence‚Äîor as much as such
        a widespread public discussion can include‚Äîand take care not to leave an erroneous
        impression as to the nature of the potential problems at hand.‚Äù We ended the Commentary by
        saying ‚ÄúWe urge both good reading and 
        critical reading<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">!‚Äù</ENAMEX> (our italics).
        These reports had as their premise the aim of neutrality in the scientific analysis of
        the issues addressed. But our concern is that some of their contents, as in the few
        examples outlined above, may have ended up distorting the potential of biomedical research
        and the motivation of some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. Continuing discussions will form the basis
        for future decisions on these topics; keeping such discussion open and balanced is of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramount</ENAMEX> importance.
