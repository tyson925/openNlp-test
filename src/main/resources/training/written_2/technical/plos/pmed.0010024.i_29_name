        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acidosis</ENAMEX> is still unclear. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that hypovolemia contributes to the problem,
        and that rehydration therapy could be of benefit. Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanjeev Krishna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have
        shown that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria dehydration</ENAMEX> is not severe and is not correlated
        with other measures of disease severity. “The optimum resuscitation approach in severe
        childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> remains to be defined,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick White</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahidol University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>),
        the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the paper. “The relative advantages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, colloids, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystalloids</ENAMEX> need to be characterized.”
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX> around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> worldwide contract <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, of whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a million</NUMEX>
        die. The vast majority of those who die are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under five years</TIMEX>, mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>,
        since young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have had little chance to acquire any immunity. Fluid resuscitation is
        generally considered to be a cornerstone of treatment—but how much fluid should be given?
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> believe that surrogate signs of fluid depletion—such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tachycardia</ENAMEX>,
        reduced capillary refill time, and reduced urine excretion—suggest that there is
        substantial volume depletion. The reason that the amount of fluid given matters so much is
        that giving too much, especially of hypotonic solutions, can lead to electrolyte imbalance,
        especially hyponatremia and hypokalemia.
        Research efforts have been hampered by not having an easy way to assess in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the
        fluid depletion in different compartments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, i.e., total body water and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> and intracellular water volume. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> used heavy-water
        distribution to calculate the total body water and bromide distribution to determine the
        extracellular volume in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with moderately severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> with severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gabon</ENAMEX>. By subtracting extracellular volume from total body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, they were able
        to calculate intracellular volume for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. They also used a less invasive and more
        rapid method of determining water volumes based on using bioelectrical impedance to
        calculate the volume.
        None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were severely dehydrated (defined as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
        depletion), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> had fluid depletion, which
        was moderate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">60–90 ml/kg depletion</ENAMEX>). “This challenges the view that dehydration is a major
        contributor to the pathology of this frequently lethal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX>.
        So based on these data, obtained from a carefully studied, albeit small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, what should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> do? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' first
        recommendation is that clinicians should think again about how vigorously they rehydrate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and if they have access to ways of assessing fluid volume more precisely, they
        should do so (not a trivial undertaking in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> where these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are
        treated). And certainly the methods used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> should undergo wider
        testing in larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to confirm their usefulness. Until the worldwide
        efforts to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> come to fruition, refining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        will remain a cornerstone of the efforts against this devastating disease.
