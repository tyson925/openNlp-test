        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. C.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) report suggesting that medical
        errors may kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> health care experts
        have tried to boost the quality of patient care by focusing on the speed and precision of
        service delivery. Several insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have already started to place a surcharge on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who elect to receive care from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúinefficient‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> (a definition that includes
        most teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>), hoping to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to seek more cost-effective service,
        and to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to provide it [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        The problem is, most of these reform efforts, while critically important, only capture
        half the picture. Efficiency isn't everything, and unless we learn to cultivate creativity
        as avidly as we pursue consistency, future generations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may find themselves
        stuck with the same basic treatments they're receiving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. It will be the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>,
        just served quickly.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benefits of Quality Reform</ENAMEX>
        From its earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, medical training was based on an apprenticeship model, in which
        junior acolytes learned the art from senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>. Even with the evolution of
        modern medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, which offered future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> a rigorous common training, once
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> entered the real world they essentially did as they pleased. Consequently, there
        were pronounced differences in approaches to common problems from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clinician to
        another.
        There was also little to guarantee that once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> had hung out their shingle, they
        were actually competent (and remained competent) to practice their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>. While most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> remained committed to the general professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">standard‚</ENAMEX>Äîdo the best that you can
        for each individual patient‚Äî many well-meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> ultimately were not delivering their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the best care available.
        More recently, and largely due to the contagious spread of the so-called ‚Äúbusiness
        model,‚Äù there has been an increased emphasis on the consistency and quality of care. The
        clear goal is ensuring that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> truly receive the very best care available, as
        defined by rigorous scientific studies.
        This discrepancy between what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> should be receiving and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        actually receiving is the major focus of quality reform, and reflects the new recognition
        that there are truly preferred approaches‚Äîpathways‚Äîto guide disease management. These
        pathways are not meant to represent a rigid algorithm reflexively applied to each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>,
        but are intended as a summary of the best available data, a useful template to guide
        further medical decisions.
        The renewed emphasis on quality has also resulted in a newfound appreciation for the
        role of experience and repetition in patient care. Study after study has shown that the
        best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> to treat a particular problem is the one who has treated it the most
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gets Lost: Innovation</ENAMEX>
        The great paradox here is that the same reforms that are improving our current care may
        also be endangering our future health. As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> has become more standardized and
        increasingly regulated, it turns out there is much less room for innovation. The spirited
        pursuit of the unknown‚Äîso long a defining quality of medicine‚Äînow seems seriously
        endangered. The new world of rapid throughput and endless documentation provides little
        time to reflect upon important clinical problems and consider fresh approaches. If
        anything, thinking about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or a question too much is now implicitly discouraged
        because it slows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> down; contemplation is bad for productivity.
        Academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> like our own have played a particularly important role in the
        history of medical discovery; the hallmark of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> is our commitment to
        thinking and reflecting about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> we see, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are often extremely sick
        and whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is exceptionally complex. Unfortunately, many of the measurements now
        used by insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to assess quality pay little attention‚Äîif any at all‚Äîto the
        complexity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, or to the importance of spending time trying to define
        the underlying malady. Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> seems to be how fast a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúprocessed</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ideally</ENAMEX> with as few tests as possible. These measures provide no mechanism for
        distinguishing between the addled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who inappropriately orders every test that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">springs</ENAMEX> to mind, and the reflective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who is trying to get to the bottom of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s complaint, rather than simply throw a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Band-Aid</ENAMEX> over the symptoms [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Situated on the front lines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> have a unique opportunity to provide new medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insights</ENAMEX> and to identify critical, unanswered questions. Classic examples include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archibald</ENAMEX>
        Garrod, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> whose desire to understand why a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> produced black urine
        led to the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> can result from defective metabolic enzymes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuller</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>, a clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> whose thoughtful approach to his patients
        yielded insights that revolutionized the field of endocrinology. More recently, the astute
        clinical observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Gottlieb</ENAMEX> resulted in the original
        description of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        Preserving <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Creativity in Medicine</ENAMEX>
        But where are these types of insights going to come from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>? It seems difficult to
        imagine that a medical care environment characterized by staccato-quick patient visits
        covering an ever-increasing number of compulsory topics will support or encourage such
        reflection and innovation. Our failure to nourish and sustain inquisitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> seems
        particularly tragic because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> has traditionally attracted some of our brightest and
        most imaginative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Even at the height of the dot-com boom, for example, there
        were still more medical school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> than there were spaces to train them. But if
        current trends continue, many of these creative minds will head elsewhere, while those who
        stay will risk becoming stultified by repetitious routine.
        Several medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> have recognized this emerging
        problem, and have initiated programs aimed at sparking curiosity in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> (our own
        school's program is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PASTEUR</ENAMEX> initiative‚<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Äîsee www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pasteur</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hms</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harvard</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. But
        as well-intentioned as these efforts are, simply changing the curriculum isn't likely to
        fix the underlying problem. Unless ever-savvy medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> perceive that inquisitive
        thinking is truly valued in clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, and unless exasperated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are
        inspired to believe that they have the ability to change some aspect of the way <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> is
        practiced, nothing is going to change. We may lose the best hope we have of defeating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">terrible diseases</ENAMEX> that now plague us.
        Even as we strive to improve the consistency of care‚Äîand striving is clearly a very good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">idea‚Äîwe</ENAMEX> must continue to cultivate novelty and originality, rather than penalize it.
        Imagination is perhaps the most essential trait that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>, must
        again learn to recognize and reward. Even with the best algorithms and the brightest
        computers, the future of health care ultimately depends upon the creativity of the hardy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> still entrusted with its delivery.
