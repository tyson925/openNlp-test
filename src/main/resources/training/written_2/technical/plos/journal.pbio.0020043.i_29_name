        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are clones like me. It is a slight oversimplification to say that
        all of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are genetically identical to each other. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>. In mammals, some cells (red blood cells) lack a nuclear genome entirely. Some
        cells have viruses‚Äîand when it's in a cell, a virus is basically a gene‚Äîthat other cells
        lack. But a typical animal is a clone in the sense that all its cells arise from that
        single fertilized egg cell.
        Not all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, however, are clones. Sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tiny embryos developing inside their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX> will fuse together into a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryo</ENAMEX> and continue developing. The resulting
        animal is not a clone, but a chimera: a conglomeration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different cell lineages into
        a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. Some species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> (marmosets) typically have chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, from
        having shared a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> supply with a twin in utero (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Haig 1999</ENAMEX>), and rare cases of accidental
        chimerism are known from many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tremblay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caltagirone</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Dijk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 1996</ENAMEX>). In marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">invertebrates</ENAMEX>, chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> often arise from the fusion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> later in development (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buss 1987).</ENAMEX> Here I want to draw attention to a remarkable
        form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chimerism</ENAMEX> found in armored scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) always develop
        not from a single fertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> but from two genetically different cells. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these
        cells develops into a special organ (the bacteriome, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> symbiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>) that
        has a nuclear genome different from that found in the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
        Obligate chimerism‚Äîthe presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genetically distinct cell lineages in every
        individual at each life stage‚Äîis found in a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, but nowhere else
        in nature. The avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalist</ENAMEX> wants to understand this sort of deep oddity for its own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sake</ENAMEX>, but such understanding might have broader implications as well. For instance,
        although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are not usually chimeras, we do have a quasi-chimeric phase in our life
        cycle: pregnancy. Some diseases of pregnancy are apparently due to conflicts between the
        genetically nonidentical tissues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fetus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haig 2002).</ENAMEX> And the main things that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">humans</ENAMEX> eat are also quasi-chimeras: the seeds of flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. In a grain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>, for
        instance, the germ, the endosperm, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bran</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different nuclear genomes, and
        the conflicts between them may be similar in some ways to the conflicts seen in human
        pregnancy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alleman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Doctor 2000</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santiago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich 2000</ENAMEX>). Ultimately, we might learn
        something about the general principles of conflict and cooperation between maternal and
        embryonic tissues that govern these cases if we can understand the uniquely stable and
        intimate chimerism of armored scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Different Cell</ENAMEX> Lineages
        In all sexual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, production of an egg cell involves meiosis, the
        complex cellular process (involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX>, recombination, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nuclear
        divisions) whereby <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> diploid nucleus (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies of each chromosome) becomes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        genetically different haploid nuclei (each with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of each chromosome). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> haploid nuclei becomes the egg <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (oocyte). In ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, the other
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nuclei (the polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>) degenerate‚Äîthey never divide again and are lost or
        destroyed‚Äîand the oocyte is the single maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> that (after fusion with a single
        paternal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, the spermatocyte) develops into the embryo. But in armored scales, the polar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bodies</ENAMEX> fuse together into a triploid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> copies of each chromosome), and this
        triploid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> also winds up in the embryo (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The triploid cell derived from the
        polar bodies fuses with one cell from the embryo to become a pentaploid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        copies of each chromosome). This pentaploid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> then proliferates to form the bacteriome
        of the embryo (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown 1965).</ENAMEX> Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in the bacteriome thus contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s complete genome, in addition to the same haploid paternal genome as the rest of
        the embryo. In contrast, the rest of the embryo contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> copy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s genome. The apparent function of the bacteriome is to house intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. During embryonic development, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> move from the mother's bacteriome into the
        cells of the embryo's bacteriome. The precise role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> is not known, but it is
        thought that they synthesize essential nutrients (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tremblay 1990</ENAMEX>), as they do in scale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>' close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, the aphids (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shigenobu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
        Now the story gets even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> is a male, then the genetic
        difference between his bacteriome and the rest of his tissues becomes even greater as he
        develops. This is because most armored scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> have an unusual genetic system called
        embryonic paternal genome elimination (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seger 1999).</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, the paternal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> is completely eliminated from most tissues very early in development‚Äîbut it is never
        eliminated from the bacteriome. As a result, most of a male armored scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insect</ENAMEX>'s tissues
        (including his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX>) have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the mother's genome (the same genome as the
        oocyte from which he developed), but his bacteriome has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complete copies of the mother's
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> and also has a paternal genome. Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>) of the gene copies in the
        male's bacteriome are absent from the rest of the male (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chimerism</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sibling Rivalry</ENAMEX>
        What could possibly be going on here? Why should scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX>, have
        obligate chimerism involving activated polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>? Essentially, we have no idea, largely
        because no one has even ventured a serious guess. When the phenomena were discovered, early
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, the theoretical tools for making sense of them were unavailable. One
        such tool is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. D. Hamilton</ENAMEX>'s (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1964a</NUMEX>) theory of inclusive fitness, which holds that the
        degree of cooperation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (or tissues) must depend upon their degree of
        genetic relatedness. But the rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamiltonian</ENAMEX> thinking coincided with the eclipse of
        classical cytogenetics in favor of the molecular biology of model <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, and these
        remarkable little chimeras have languished in undeserved obscurity. Perhaps merely by
        looking at them with a modern eye, we can turn up some plausible hypotheses.
        Consider the special theoretical difficulty posed by chimerism between tissues derived
        from the oocyte and those derived from the polar bodies ejected by it during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">meiosis</TIMEX>. Two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siblings</ENAMEX> will typically exhibit some degree of sibling rivalry‚Äîtheir interests are not
        identical. If an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> were a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chimera</ENAMEX> comprising full-sibling tissues (identical
        across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> of their genomes), there might be conflict between the two
        nonidentical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lineages</ENAMEX>, as there is between the tissues of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> mammal and her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fetus</ENAMEX> (also identical across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of their genomes) during pregnancy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haig 2002).</ENAMEX> This may
        explain why obligate sibling chimerism never evolves (except perhaps in the very limited
        case of blood cells between sibling marmosets). But the problem of cooperation between
        tissues that derive from the oocyte and those that derive from the polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> is, if
        anything, even greater. The oocyte and the polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are 
        less closely related than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> would be, because the polar bodies
        are enriched for chromosome regions 
        not present in the oocyte.
        If there were no crossing over between homologous chromosomes during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">meiosis</TIMEX>, then the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> would consistently separate the chromosomes derived from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> from the chromosomes derived from the mother's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, producing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells
        that are not related to each other 
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all</TIMEX> (or, more precisely, exactly as closely related to each other as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was to the mother's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>). Crossing over prevents this, creating a
        mosaic of related and unrelated chromosome regions between the products of the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meiotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> and uncertain relationships between the final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> meiotic products.
        Nonetheless, the consistently depressed relatedness between the oocyte and the polar bodies
        may help to explain why polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are almost always eliminated‚Äîsibling rivalry might be
        even greater if some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> were derived from each other's polar bodies.
      
      
        Towards an Explanation
        So how and why did <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects tame</ENAMEX> and domesticate their potentially
        fractious polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, rather than killing them like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">normal animals</ENAMEX> do? There are at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> lines of thinking that seem promising for unraveling this mystery.
        
          Histological eusociality and relatedness.
          There are interesting parallels between, on the one hand, the chimerism seen in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">armored scale insects</ENAMEX> and, on the other hand, the eusociality (true sociality) seen in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> and honeybees. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> and honeybees, sterile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>) provide
          nutrition to their potentially fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>. In armored scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, a genetically
          distinct but ultimately sterile cell lineage (the bacteriome) provides nutrition to its
          potentially fertile ‚Äúsibling‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lineage (the rest of the scale insect)‚Äîthough, of
          course, polar body-derived cells are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsibling‚Äù</ENAMEX> in a strange special sense. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, armored scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> are effectively haplodiploid: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> transmit only the
          chromosomes they inherited from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, and all of a male's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> are identical to
          each other. This ‚Äúclonality‚Äù of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> boosts the relatedness between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1964b</NUMEX>) pointed out that this high relatedness can explain the high level of
          cooperation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> seen in eusocial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> and honeybees. High levels of
          cooperation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> have since been found in haplodiploid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">thrips</ENAMEX> as well (Crespi
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). It is tempting to speculate that similar explanations can be applied to
          ‚Äúhistological eusociality‚Äù seen in the cooperation between related tissues in scale
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>.
          This temptation increases when we consider another case from the old cytogenetics
          literature of apparent histological eusociality, though not of true permanent chimerism.
          This occurs in a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of parasitoid wasps (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tremblay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caltagirone</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strand</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grbic 1997</ENAMEX>), in which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> derived from polar bodies form a membrane around the
          yolkless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> that is deposited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wasp</ENAMEX>'s insect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> (which is often a scale
          insect!). Similar to the worker <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX> and the scale insect bacteriome, this membrane is
          thought to mediate nutrition of the developing embryo, and, similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX>, honeybees,
          and scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, these wasps are haplodiploid.
          But although it is tempting to conclude that haplodiploidy plays the same role in
          promoting histological eusociality as it does in promoting organismal eusociality, the
          temptation should probably be resisted. In the case of the parasitoid wasps, the polar
          body-derived tissue has no paternal genome, so the clonality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> cannot boost its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relatedness</ENAMEX> to anything. In the case of armored scale insect chimerism, the bacteriome
          does have a copy of the paternal genome, and that copy is identical to the paternal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> in the rest of the embryo, so in that sense the two tissues do have a high
          relatedness similar to the high relatedness of full <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> under haplodiploidy. But the
          scale insect bacteriome gets its copy of the paternal genome directly from the embryo, so
          the clonality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> (the source of elevated relatedness between haplodiploid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>)
          apparently has nothing to do with it. Some other explanation is probably needed.
        
        
          Maternal interests.
          Note that, whatever the relationship between the polar body-derived tissues and the
          rest of the insect, the polar bodies contain the mother's complete genome. And while your
          polar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> may be 
          less related to you, on average, than your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> are, they are 
          more related to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> (and, of course, to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>) than
          they are to you! Perhaps the polar bodies function to somehow enforce some maternal or
          family interest, nipping in the bud some sibling rivalry that would otherwise suppress
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s fitness. In haplodiploid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are more closely related to their
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> (with whom they share <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-quarters</TIMEX> of their gene copies) than to their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brothers</ENAMEX> (with whom they share only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-quarter</NUMEX> of their gene copies). So if there is
          competition between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> for resources, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are expected to behave more
          antagonistically towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and more cooperatively towards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>. In contrast, a
          female is equally related to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> as she is to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> (each carries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of her gene
          copies). These asymmetries in relatedness lead to struggles in haplodiploid social
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> seeking to direct more resources towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and with sisters
          seeking to direct more resources away from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and towards each other (Seger
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stubblefield 2002).</ENAMEX>
          It is difficult to see how such a struggle might play itself out in scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>,
          which are hardly social <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>. The only motile stage in a female's life is the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">instar (‚Äúcrawler‚Äù</ENAMEX>), after which she settles in one spot permanently. The male is slightly
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile</ENAMEX>, having a motile (usually winged) adult form. Nonetheless, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the low
          motility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, and the fact that they live mostly on long-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">woody plants</ENAMEX>, means
          that maternal kin may interact over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long timescales</TIMEX>, as in social <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) some scale
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> appear to make relatively sophisticated social decisions about where to settle,
          settling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer</NUMEX> to (and thus possibly competing more closely with) non-kin than kin
          (Kasuya <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) although most scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> use phloem sap, an almost inexhaustible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>, armored scales use parenchyma tissues (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen 1990)</ENAMEX>, which may be locally
          exhausted, and therefore may compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. Thus, it is conceivable
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> may compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> for resources, that they may make
          decisions that affect the intensity of that competition, and that such decisions may have
          different optima from the perspectives of maternal versus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paternal genes</ENAMEX>. Possibly, the
          presence of a massive contingent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maternal genes</ENAMEX> (a double dose of the complete
          maternal genome) in a nutritionally significant tissue like the bacteriome might somehow
          affect such decisions in ways favorable to maternal interests. Proximal mechanisms might
          include effects on signals or perceptions related to relatedness, gender, site quality,
          or satiety.
          Similar manipulation of intersibling interaction might be going on in the case of the
          parasitoid wasps that have polar body-derived membranes around their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. Sometimes
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wasps</ENAMEX> lay a single unfertilized (male) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> and a single fertilized (female) egg
          into the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> divide to form embryos, which divide into a clone of many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX>. Some of the embryos become sterile ‚Äúprecocious‚Äù larvae that can apparently
          attack other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">larvae</ENAMEX> trying to use the same host‚Äîincluding, potentially, their own
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siblings</ENAMEX> (Ode and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter 2002).</ENAMEX> Here is a situation in which the polar body <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (in the
          membranes surrounding the proliferating embryos) might have very different selective
          optima for levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between-sibling aggressiveness‚</NUMEX>Äîand even for rates of
          development‚Äîthan the genes in the embryos they surround, and (because they apparently
          mediate the nutrition of the embryos) they might be able to influence how the embryos
          develop.
        
        
          Gender crypsis.
          The endosymbiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that dwell in the scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>' bacteriomes are maternally
          inherited. Thus, from the perspective of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> are deadends. Many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maternally</ENAMEX> inherited <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> have evolved to manipulate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>' genetic system for
          their own advantage. Some bacterial lineages induce parthenogenesis or feminize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> may even evolve to suicidally kill male embryos that they find themselves in, if
          the death of the male frees up resources that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> can use (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Majerus 2003).</ENAMEX> In
          order to do this, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> must respond to some cue that indicates the gender of the
          individual they are in. Potentially, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> could evolve resistance to such manipulation
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maternally</ENAMEX> inherited <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> by depriving those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> of cues indicating gender.
          In armored scales, the bacteriome has exactly the same genome (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complete copies of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>'s diploid genome and one complete copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s genome) in all full
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siblings</ENAMEX>, whether they are male or female, and the same is usually true in mealybugs.
          This might explain why the bacteriome is the only tissue in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s genome
          remains present and active in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Prospects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Scale insects</ENAMEX> and their bacteriomes challenge our notion of what an individual is. Is a
        scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insect</ENAMEX>'s bacteriome a kind of sibling? Is it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> sibling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> self? Is it a sterile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slave</ENAMEX>, under control? Is it an extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, exerting control? In all other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, chimeras are temporary and unstable. How have scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> suppressed the
        conflicts that normally tear chimeras apart? To approach such questions, we'll have to
        revive the empirical study of scale insect bacteriomes, combining approaches from recent
        studies of aphid bacteriomes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braendle et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) and of human pregnancy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haig 2002).</ENAMEX> We
        can better understand the nature of genetic conflicts in scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> by studies of the
        genetic structure of scale insect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, together with studies of sex ratio variation
        and the proximate mechanisms of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>. For simplicity, I have described only
        the most common of the huge variety of very different scale insect genetic systems and
        modes of bacteriome development (Tremblay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977, 1990</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nur 1980).</ENAMEX> This diversity (greater
        than for the comparable cases of mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">placentas</ENAMEX> and flowering-plant endosperms) means
        there is a huge scope for comparative ecological and genetic studies that could help
        elucidate general principles. The study of truly strange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> can tell us what kinds
        of things are possible. That's why we will be so interested in any life found on another
        planet and why, in the meantime, we should take a close look at scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>.
