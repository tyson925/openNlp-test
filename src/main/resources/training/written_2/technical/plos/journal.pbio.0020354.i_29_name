        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology, Hebert et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) have set out to test the resolution
        and performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúDNA barcoding</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äù</ENAMEX> using a single mtDNA gene, cytochrome 
        c oxidase I (COI), for a sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. Before turning
        to details of this study, it is useful as context to consider the following questions: What
        is DNA barcoding, and what does it promise? What is new about it? Why is it controversial?
        What are the potential pitfalls?
        Put simply, the intent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA barcoding</ENAMEX> is to use large-scale screening of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or a few
        reference genes in order to (i) assign unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) enhance
        discovery of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoeckle 2003).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> envisage
        development of a comprehensive database of sequences, preferably associated with voucher
        specimens representing described <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, against which sequences from sampled individuals
        can be compared. Given the long history of use of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> (e.g., allozymes, rDNA,
        and mtDNA) for these purposes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Avise 2004</ENAMEX>), there is nothing fundamentally new in the DNA
        barcoding concept, except increased scale and proposed standardization. The former is
        inevitable. Standardization, i.e., the selection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more reference genes, is of
        proven value in the microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and in stimulating large-scale phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, but whether ‚Äúone gene fits all‚Äù is open to debate.
        Why, then, all the fuss? Initial reactions to the DNA barcoding concept have ranged from
        unbridled enthusiasm, especially from ecologists (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Janzen 2004</ENAMEX>), to outright condemnation,
        largely from taxonomists (e.g., see the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2003</TIMEX> issue of 
        Trends in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evolution</ENAMEX> ). The former view reflects a real need
        to connect different life history stages and to increase the precision and efficiency of
        field studies involving diverse and difficult-to-identify taxa. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criticisms</ENAMEX> are mainly
        in response to the view that single-gene sequences should be the primary identifier for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species (‚ÄúDNA taxonomy‚Äù</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tautz et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; see also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blaxter 2004).</ENAMEX> At least for the
        macrobiota, the DNA barcoding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> has moved away from this to emphasize the
        importance of embedding any large-scale sequence database within the existing framework and
        practice of systematics, including the importance of voucher specimens and of integrating
        molecular with morphological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. Another point of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">contention‚Äîthat DNA barcodes</ENAMEX> have
        limited phylogenetic resolution‚Äîarises from confusion about the scope of inference. At
        best, single-gene assays can hope to identify an individual to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or reveal
        inconsistencies between molecular variation and current perceptions of species boundaries.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> barcoding should not be confused with efforts to resolve the ‚Äútree of life.‚Äù It should
        connect with and benefit from such projects, but resolving phylogeny at scales from species
        to major eukaryotic clades requires a very different strategy for selecting genes. Indeed,
        the very characteristic that makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COI</ENAMEX> gene a candidate for high-throughput DNA
        barcoding‚Äîhighly constrained amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> and thus broad applicability of primers
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>)‚Äîalso limits its information content at deeper phylogenetic levels
        (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russo</ENAMEX> et al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zardoya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naylor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown 1997).</ENAMEX> Finally, while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superficially</ENAMEX> appealing, the very term <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA barcoding</ENAMEX> is unfortunate, as it implies that
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has a fixed and invariant characteristic‚Äîlike a barcode on a supermarket
        product. As evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, we should question this analogy.
        In evaluating the promise and pitfalls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA barcoding</ENAMEX>, we need to separate the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of application: molecular diagnostics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> relative to described taxa, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-led discovery of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Both are inherently phylogenetic and rely on a solid
        taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>, including adequate sampling of variation within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and inclusion
        of all previously described <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extant species</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given genus</TIMEX>. Accurate diagnosis depends
        on low intraspecific variation compared with that between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, such that a short DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> will allow precise allocation of an individual to a described taxon. The extensive
        literature on mtDNA phylogeography (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avise 2000)</ENAMEX> indicates that this condition often holds,
        although there are exceptions. Furthermore, within many species there is sufficient
        structure that it will be possible to allocate an individual to a particular geographic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Such identifications should be accompanied by a statement of confidence‚Äîe.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>,
        node support in a phylogenetic analysis and caveats in relation to the breath of sampling
        in the reference database (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale forensics</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palumbi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cipriano 1998).</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-led species discovery is more contentious, but again is not new. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
        inclusion of mtDNA evidence in biogeographic and systematic analyses often reveals
        unexpected diversity or discordance with morphology, which then prompts re-evaluation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphological</ENAMEX> and ecological characteristics and, if warranted, taxonomic revision. But,
        despite recent proposals (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Penkrot</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), it does not follow
        that mtDNA divergence should be a primary criterion for recognizing species boundaries (see
        also Sites and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall 2003).</ENAMEX> Potential limitations of using mtDNA to infer species
        boundaries include retention of ancestral polymorphism, male-biased gene flow, selection on
        any mtDNA nucleotide (as the whole genome is one linkage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>), introgression following
        hybridization, and paralogy resulting from transfer of mtDNA gene copies to the nucleus.
        These are acknowledged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) and well documented in the literature
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bensasson et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitlock 2004)</ENAMEX>, including that on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> (Degnan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lovette</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bermingham</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weckstein et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). More
        specifically, using some level of mtDNA divergence as a yardstick for species boundaries
        ignores the low precision with which coalescence of mtDNA predicts phylogenetic divergence
        at nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turelli 2003).</ENAMEX> An additional problem with focusing on mtDNA
        (or any other molecular) divergence as a primary criterion for recognizing species is that
        it will lead us to overlook new or rapidly diverged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, such as might arise through
        divergent selection or polyploidy, and thus to conclude that speciation requires long-term
        isolation. For example, a recent mtDNA analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) showed that numerous avian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> have low divergences and that speciation can occur
        relatively rapidly under certain circumstances. We contend, therefore, that whereas
        divergent or discordant mtDNA sequences might stimulate taxonomic reassessment based on
        nuclear genes as well as morphology, ecology, or behavior, mtDNA divergence is neither
        necessary nor sufficient as a criterion for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">delineating species</ENAMEX>. This view accords with
        existing practice: taxonomic splits in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> typically are based on multiple
        lines of biological evidence, e.g., morphological and vocal differences as well as genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Ornithologists' Union</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>).
        We turn now to the core of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et al.</ENAMEX>'s paper‚ÄîCOI sequencing of a substantial sample
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">667</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) and its validity as a test of the barcoding
        concept. Their aim is to test ‚Äúthe correspondence between species boundaries signaled by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COI</ENAMEX> barcodes and those established by prior taxonomic research.‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are
        an interesting choice because their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-level taxonomy is relatively well resolved and
        there has been extensive previous analysis of levels of mtDNA sequence divergence within
        and among described <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klicka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zink</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avise</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Walker</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero 2004).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) found differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences ‚Äúbetween</ENAMEX> closely
        related species‚Äù that were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19‚Äì24</NUMEX> times greater in magnitude than the differences within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.05</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äì7</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.93%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.27</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äì0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.43%</NUMEX>, respectively). From these data, they conclude that
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species</ENAMEX> can be discriminated via molecular diagnosis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and propose a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústandard sequence threshold‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times the mean intraspecific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> (yielding a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7%</NUMEX> threshold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>) to flag genetically divergent taxa as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúprovisional species</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Thus</ENAMEX>, their analysis seeks to address both potential applications of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA barcoding</ENAMEX>.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herbert et</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">al.</ENAMEX> sampled a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, a true test of the precision
        of mtDNA barcodes to assign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> would include comparisons with sister
        species‚Äîthe most closely related extant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. This would require that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
        genus be examined, rather than a random sample of imprecisely defined close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, and
        that taxa be included from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> geographic region. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>)
        showed the importance of comparing sister species when examining genetic divergence values
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, with results that contrast strongly with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et al.</ENAMEX> as
        well as previous studies (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Klicka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zink 1997).</ENAMEX> For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> pairs of avian sister
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mtDNA sequence divergences</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0% to 8.2%</NUMEX>, with an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9%</NUMEX> (cf.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7% to 8%</NUMEX> among closely related species in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et al.</ENAMEX>). Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX>) are at
        or below the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7%</NUMEX> threshold proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert et al.</ENAMEX> and thus would not be recognized as
        species despite biological differences. Moreover, although only a few of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> pairs
        (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>]) had sufficient sampling to assess intraspecific
        variation in mtDNA sequences, these typically showed paraphyly in mtDNA haplotypes.
        Therefore, there are still too few cases with adequate sampling of intraspecific diversity
        for sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> pairs to know how common paraphyly is, although a recent meta-analysis
        found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species</ENAMEX> deviated from mtDNA monophyly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omland 2003).</ENAMEX>
        Collectively, these observations cast doubt on the precision of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA barcoding</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allocating individuals</ENAMEX> to previously described avian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        
        Empidonax flycatchers, which are renowned for their
        morphological similarity and could thereby benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-based identification tools,
        provide an example of the importance of a more detailed analysis. A complete molecular
        phylogeny for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero 2002)</ENAMEX> yielded distances <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four</NUMEX> pairs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> species that ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7%</NUMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. difficilis</ENAMEX> versus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. occidentalis</ENAMEX> ) to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6%</NUMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. traillii</ENAMEX> versus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. alnorum</ENAMEX> ); notably, the genetic distance between mainland and
        island <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. difficilis</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. d.</ENAMEX> difficilis and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. d.</ENAMEX> insulicola , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9%</NUMEX>) was greater than that between sister
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cicero 2002).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert et al.</ENAMEX>'s analysis included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empidonax</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. traillii</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. virescens</ENAMEX> ), which are not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of divergent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clades</ENAMEX>. Because 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. virescens</ENAMEX> is genetically distant from all other species of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empidonax</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.3% to 12.5%</NUMEX> uncorrected distance; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cicero 2002</ENAMEX>), its comparison with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.</ENAMEX> trailli therefore inflates estimates of interspecific
        distances within the genus.
        Another key point of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et al.</ENAMEX>'s analysis was to estimate levels of intraspecific
        diversity. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> species of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">260</TIMEX> examined, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were sequenced (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, mean = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>), and pooled pairwise
        genetic distances were found to be uncorrelated with geographic distances, leading Hebert
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> to conclude that ‚Äúhigh levels of intraspecific divergence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> appear uncommon.‚Äù However, this makes the assumption that there is a common
        underlying pattern of phylogeographic structure, which is unlikely for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> birds
        (Zink <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zink et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). If there is significant variation, assessment of
        intraspecific diversity can be based on a small sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> only if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        are sampled across existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> subdivisions for which geography and phenotypic
        variation are reasonable initial surrogates.
        The analyses presented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et al.</ENAMEX> will certainly stimulate further debate (a reply
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hebert et al.</ENAMEX> to the present letter is posted at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barcodinglife</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>), but, for
        the reasons outlined here, they are not yet a definitive test of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of DNA
        barcoding for either diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. We also question
        whether the results for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> can be extrapolated to the tropics, where DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barcoding</ENAMEX> could have maximum value. In general, among-population sequence divergence
        increases with decreasing latitude, even excluding previously glaciated regions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">MacKay 2004</ENAMEX>), and studies of intraspecific genetic diversity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neotropical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> have
        revealed a higher level of phylogeographic subdivision compared to temperate species
        (Remsen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovette</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bermingham 2001).</ENAMEX> Thus, the general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of mtDNA barcoding
        across different biogeographic regions‚Äîand between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> versus migratory taxa‚Äîrequires
        further scrutiny.
        There is little doubt that large-scale and standardized sequencing, when integrated with
        existing taxonomic practice, can contribute significantly to the challenges of identifying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and increasing the rate of discovering biological diversity. But to determine
        when and where this approach is applicable, we now need to discover the boundary
        conditions. The real challenge lies with tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">taxa</ENAMEX> and those with limited dispersal and
        thus substantial phylogeographic structure. Such analyses need to be taxonomically broad
        and need to extend beyond the focal geographic region to ensure that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> taxa
        are evaluated and can be discriminated. There is also the need to examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with
        frequent (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">possibly cryptic</NUMEX>) hybridization, recent radiations, and high rates of gene
        transfer from mtDNA to the nucleus. Only then will the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeptics</ENAMEX> be satisfied.
