        Approved by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">External Review Board</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> of an academic health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is to advance the
        understanding and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> through clinical research. In this pursuit, there is
        a need for checks and balances. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Gelsinger</ENAMEX>, a relatively healthy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>,
        died in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> during a clinical trial of a novel adenovirus-based genetic therapy
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency</ENAMEX>, it was a tragedy [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In retrospect, there were
        many clues that there were problems with the adenovirus vector, clues that neither the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">investigator</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> pursued.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Milstein</ENAMEX> made the case that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> were both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blinded</ENAMEX> to these problems by their heavy financial investment in the technology, an
        investment worth <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Though the legal case was settled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>,
        it created a de facto standard that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> with commercial rights in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> or
        technology should not be allowed to pursue clinical trials involving that new technology. I
        do not believe that such a blanket prohibition is necessary.
        At its core, the issue revolves around conflicts of interest. In clinical research, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> should be primarily an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or volunteer. The core reason
        to perform clinical research is to create generalizable knowledge about a therapy, patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, or a disease process with the long-term intent of improving human health. The
        interests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> should be fully aligned. However, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        in clinical research have other, more personal motivations, intermixed with the desire for
        progress. Successful research projects can lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>, promotions, grant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">renewals</ENAMEX>, and per case clinical trial enrollment fees. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have intellectual
        property rights that may have very substantial financial value if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> or device
        reaches the level of approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> stand to gain personally if the clinical trial is successful, a situation
        that has the potential to distort the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>'s objectivity, and may lead to a less
        honest relationship with study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>.
        In order to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> are honest with potential research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>, the
        system of institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review boards</ENAMEX> (IRBs) evolved. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> approves the informed consent
        document, which should describe the clinical experiment in a clear and dispassionate way to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRBs</ENAMEX> are largely made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>, although there are also public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and nonscientists on most IRB panels.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> must remain autonomous and be able to hold up or stop an investigation. There is an
        obligation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and foremost think about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> rights and safety.
        The passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bayh–Dole Act</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> to license inventions for
        commercial development [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> or
        technology is at the time of licensure, the more valuable it becomes. Therefore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> have an incentive to advance the clinical development of inventions by their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>. In this regard, they are very much like corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> of research, subject to
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> oversight as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>.
        In terms of performing clinical trials using new technologies in which it has a
        financial interest, how is a university different from a corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX>? In regard to
        patient safety, one primary distinction rests with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX>. The corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> will
        present the research protocol to an independent commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IRB</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> to its own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX>. Yet in both cases, there are potential conflicts of interest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> IRB
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> will have a conflict of interest between the investments of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> and the
        rights of the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>. Independent commercial IRBs depend on pleasing corporate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> for their continued existence, and there is an unstated expectation that they
        will both be fast and produce rulings consistent with corporate expectations (which in most
        cases include a desire to do the research ethically).
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> level a logical and conservative solution to the problem of
        institutional conflicts is to require that an IRB from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> become the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> of record when such a conflict arises. This external IRB could be either an independent
        commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IRB</ENAMEX> or one of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>. The key is to grant the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> independence and
        the authority to provide real oversight.
        There are other elements of conflicts of interest that need to be considered when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> has a commercial interest, but most have more to do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        personal conflicts than institutional conflicts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> needs to assure the
        presence of an independent data safety monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, thorough audits of good clinical
        practice, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications committee</ENAMEX> that will ensure submission of all meaningful study
        results, whether positive, negative, or neutral. Anyone subjectively evaluating patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> should be as free of conflicts as possible. These steps can be formulaically required,
        which should allow for performance of clinical research despite the presence of
        institutional commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Korn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Viewpoint: Academic Biomedical Research Must Be Free</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taint of</ENAMEX>
        Financial Compromise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, and especially their academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, have
        greatly benefited from their uniquely privileged status in our society. That status is
        rooted in public confidence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> and their faculties will be
        independent and impartial in fulfilling both their academic mission to create, transmit,
        and preserve knowledge, and their duty to the general society to serve as credible,
        trustworthy arbiters of knowledge. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important mark of this status has been the
        remarkably consistent generosity of public support for biomedical research. Another has
        been the noteworthy deference of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to university autonomy, and the
        light hand with which the sponsoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> historically have overseen the conduct of
        university research.
        When federal interposition occurred, it typically responded to widely publicized
        episodes of research misconduct, sometimes intertwined with egregious financial self
        interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>; these episodes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legitimately</ENAMEX> questioned the effectiveness of
        institutional oversight. Nevertheless, regulations consistently focused more on defining
        the metes and bounds of the permissible than on prescriptive mandates, and their
        implementation was effected largely through the mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“assurances”—commitments</ENAMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> would faithfully safeguard the specified perimeters of acceptable conduct.
        Awardee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> thus bear primary responsibility for assuring the credibility and
        integrity of federally sponsored research. Public confidence in the trustworthiness of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> is critical, and yet nowhere is it more fragile than in biomedical
        research involving human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. That confidence eroded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> and 1990s
        because of reports of scientific misconduct and of individual and institutional financial
        self interests in clinical trials. Scathing reports from federal oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and
        angry congressional hearings questioned whether financially self-interested institutions
        could any longer be trusted to guard the welfare of research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> or the integrity
        of clinical research.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of American Medical Colleges</ENAMEX> convened a task force to examine
        and make recommendations on individual and institutional financial self interests in
        clinical research. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> began by recognizing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> important trends over the past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</TIMEX>. First, the nature and culture of academic biomedical research have changed,
        bringing the potential of commercial relevance even to the most fundamental of scientific
        discoveries. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, there has been enormous growth in the extent and depth of interactions
        between research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> and industry, especially in biomedicine. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the public
        has become increasingly impatient that its extraordinary investments in research yield more
        effective disease preventions and therapies. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, the involvement of academic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in the translation of their discoveries has been essential in bringing those
        discoveries to market and to the benefit of public health.
        But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX>, in its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reports, asserted that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and institutional
        financial conflicts of interest in clinical research could be problematic [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>]. It
        recommended urgent and substantial refinement and strengthening of institutional policies
        and practices for monitoring, managing, and—when necessary—extinguishing such
        conflicts.
        Both reports rest on a common set of core principles. The most important is that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> should regard all significant financial interests in research involving human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> as potentially problematic. Where such interests exist, there should be a
        rebuttable presumption that the concerned individual or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> should not conduct the
        research, absent compelling circumstances. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX>, after intense
        debate, rejected categorical prohibitions lest they unintentionally impede the translation
        of research discoveries into tangible public benefits.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> acknowledged that the issue of institutional financial self interests is
        extraordinarily complex and sensitive, since it touches the very core of institutional
        autonomy. But the fact that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> has a financial interest per se should raise a
        strong presumption against its participation in the clinical testing of that product.
        Public accountability and scientific integrity require that all research results emanating
        from academic medicine be as free as possible from the taint of financial compromise.
        Adding human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to the research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mix</ENAMEX> should raise the barrier to the highest level
        and require compelling justification for any participation by a financially self-interested
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> did not define “compelling,” believing that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> should make
        that determination based on disinterested scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of each
        case. For example, there may exist in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> a unique capability, without
        which the proposed research involving human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> could not be conducted as
        effectively or safely, or at all. In these instances, the public and science deserve access
        to that capability, provided the necessary safeguards are put in place to mediate the
        conflicting interests. In all such instances, protection of scientific integrity and the
        welfare of research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> must remain the foremost priority of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>.
        This narrow window avoids absolute prohibition while striving to prevent institutional
        participation where credible alternatives exist. Only by such stringent self-policing can
        we sustain the trustworthiness and credibility of biomedical research, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, and
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, while continuing vigorously to promote the translation of biomedical
        discovery for the public's benefit.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross McKinney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Response to David Korn's Viewpoint</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> has every right to expect that academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are working <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>'s interest. This value is even codified in the laws granting these institutions
        tax-exempt status. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> also expects that new, more effective therapies will be
        developed swiftly as a consequence of its support for academic research.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of a new technology is always more motivated to see it through to
        widespread use than anyone else. This motivation, which may be as simple and benign as
        curiosity or as easy to understand as a financial incentive, is a powerful force driving
        human research. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> can be disciplined and controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> and policies on
        conflicts of interest. Personal investment in research is, nevertheless, an important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX> of scientific progress.
        When society makes an unnecessarily broad assumption that nearly all research with
        financial implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> or their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> is potentially corrupted, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brake</ENAMEX> is placed on progress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> will be better served by establishing clear guidelines
        and formalizing oversight of the research process than by rigidly limiting clinical
        research affected by conflict of interest. As examples, clinical trials should have
        independent data safety monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> charged to review the study design, execution,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> analysis, and publication of results. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> system should be strengthened in its
        independence through the use of community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. And, to be certain that institutional
        conflict of interest is avoided, an IRB from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> in most cases will be
        preferable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> wants better treatments. The fact that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> has mixed motives for
        developing a new treatment has always been acknowledged. The need to carefully manage the
        experimental process in human studies has always been understood. However, when rules
        minimize the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventors</ENAMEX> at academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, by forcing trials of their new ideas to
        go to outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> loses more than it gains. The incremental gain in
        safety is likely to be small (particularly if oversight is well established), while the
        decrease in speed of development will be significant.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Korn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross McKinney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Viewpoint</ENAMEX>
        There are many similarities between the position espoused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross McKinney</ENAMEX> and my
        position. Most saliently, we both recognize the critically important role played by
        academic biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> in making discoveries and in facilitating their efficient
        translation into beneficial products. Neither of us proposes that academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>,
        or their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, should be flatly prohibited from trying to foster that translation
        in the presence of financial self interests.
        But there is an important difference. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKinney</ENAMEX>'s approach for dealing with institutional
        conflicts of interest depends critically on the engagement of external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to monitor
        closely both scientific integrity and the welfare of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. That, in my view,
        would require such deep interposition of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> into the conduct of academic research
        as to be not only unprecedented but unfeasible. Beyond that, the approach falls short with
        respect to the maintenance of institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trustworthiness</ENAMEX> and protection of public
        trust.
        Routine clinical assessment of technologies by financially interested institutions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fosters</ENAMEX> public cynicism and distrust of the motives of academic biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. The
        protective mechanisms recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKinney</ENAMEX> are opaque to the public and reflect a
        “business as usual” image that fails fully to account for the markedly changed
        circumstances and perceptions of academic biomedical research. Most important, the
        mechanisms appear to be aimed primarily at protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>' financial
        interests.
        By contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Association of Medical Colleges</ENAMEX> formulation urges that any
        institutional involvement in clinical research involving human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the presence
        of financial conflicts must be predicated on the presence or absence within the institution
        of demonstrably unique capability. This approach offers a much higher and more credible
        standard that aims to protect not only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> well-being and scientific integrity, but
        also institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trustworthiness</ENAMEX> and public trust.
