        in a radio debate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theconnection</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/</ENAMEX>shows<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2004/01/20040106</NUMEX>_b_main.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asp</ENAMEX>) on human
        life extension that was remarkable for one thing: on the key issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kass</ENAMEX> was right and
        Sinclair wrong. Sinclair suggested, as have other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, including his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guarente</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute</ENAMEX> on Aging advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Blackburn</ENAMEX>,
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kass</ENAMEX> and other bioconservatives are creating a false alarm about life extension,
        because only a modest (say, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>) increase in human life span is achievable by biomedical
        intervention, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kass</ENAMEX>'s apprehensions concern extreme or indefinite life extension.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kass</ENAMEX> retorted that science isn't like that: modest success tends to place the bit between
        our teeth and can often result in advances far exceeding our expectations.
        
        Coping with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methuselah</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> essays, mostly on the economics
        of life extension but also including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> essay surveying the biology of aging and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on
        the ethics of life extension. The economic issues addressed are wide ranging, including
        detailed analysis of the balance between wealth creation by the employed and wealth
        consumption in pensions and health care; most chapters focus on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, but the
        closing chapter discusses these issues in a global context. Each essay is followed by a
        short commentary by another distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>. Within their own scope, all of these
        contributions are highly informative and rigorous. Dishearteningly, however, all echo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair</ENAMEX>'s views about the limited prospects for life extension in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming decades</TIMEX>. In
        my opinion, they make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct oversights.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> concerns current science. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair</ENAMEX> and several other prominent gerontologists
        are presently seeking human therapies based on the long-standing observation that lifelong
        restriction of caloric intake considerably extends both the healthy and total life span of
        nearly all species in which it has been tried, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> that
        elicit the gene expression changes that result from caloric restriction might, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> assert, extend human life span by something approaching the same proportion as seen
        in rodentsâ<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">€”20%</NUMEX> is often predictedâ€”without impacting quality of life, and even when
        administered starting in middle age. They assiduously stress, however, that anything beyond
        this degree of life extension is inconceivable.
        I agree with these predictions in two respects: that the degree of life extension
        achieved by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-generation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> of this sort may well approach the (currently unknown)
        amount elicitable by caloric restriction itself in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and that it is unlikely to be
        much exceeded by later <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that work the same way. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other ways, however, I claim
        they are incorrect. The first error is the assumption of proportionality: I have recently
        argued (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Grey 2004</ENAMEX>), from evolutionary considerations, that longer-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will
        show a smaller maximal proportional life-span extension in response to starvation, probably
        not much more than the same 
        absolute increase seen in shorter-lived species. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> error is the
        assertion that no other type of intervention can do better. In concert with other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> whose areas of expertise span the relevant fields, I have described (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Grey et</ENAMEX>
        al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002, 2004</TIMEX>) a strategy built around the actual 
        repair (not just <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> of accumulation) of age-related molecular
        and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">damageâ</ENAMEX>€”consisting of just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> major categories of â€˜rejuvenation therapyâ€™
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1)â€”that</ENAMEX> appears technically feasible and, by its nature, is indefinitely extensible
        to greater life spans without recourse to further conceptual breakthroughs.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> oversight made both by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> to 
        Coping with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methuselah</ENAMEX> and by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> is demographic. Life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectancy</ENAMEX> is typically defined in terms of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demographers</ENAMEX> call a period survival curve,
        which is a purely artificial construction derived from the proportions of those of each age
        at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of a given year</TIMEX> who die during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜life expectancyâ€™</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜populationâ€™</ENAMEX> thus described is that of a hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> live all
        their lives with the mortality risk at each age that the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of that age
        experienced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of interest. The remaining life expectancy of someone aged 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> is more than this life expectancy minus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> mathematical (what one actually wants, roughly, is
        the age to which the probability of survival is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> that of survival to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ) and one biomedical (mortality rates at each age, especially advanced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ages</ENAMEX>, tend to fall with time). My spirits briefly rose on reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX>'s
        explicit statement (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 69</ENAMEX>) of the latter reason. Unfortunately, they didn't discuss what
        would happen if age-specific mortality rates fell by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 2%</NUMEX> per year. An interesting
        scenario was thus unexplored: that in which mortality rates fall so fast that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s 
        remaining (not merely total) life expectancy increases with time. Is this
        unimaginably fast? Not at all: it is simply the ratio of the mortality rates at consecutive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ages</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX>) in the age range where most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> die, which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10%</NUMEX> per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. I term this rate of reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">age-specific</ENAMEX> mortality risk â€˜actuarial escape
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">velocityâ€™</ENAMEX> (AEV), because an individual's remaining life expectancy is affected by aging and
        by improvements in life-extending therapy in a way qualitatively very similar to how the
        remaining life expectancy of someone jumping off a cliff is affected by, respectively,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gravity</ENAMEX> and upward jet propulsion (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        The escape velocity cusp is closer than you might guess. Since we are already so long
        lived, even a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> increase in healthy life span will give the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> of
        rejuvenation therapies another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 yearsâ€”an</NUMEX> eternity in scienceâ€”to benefit from
        second-generation therapies that would give another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>, and so on ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">infinitum</ENAMEX>. Thus, if
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-generation rejuvenation therapies were universally available and this progress in
        developing rejuvenation therapy could be indefinitely maintained, these advances would put
        us beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AEV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX> availability might be thought economically and sociopolitically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implausible</ENAMEX> (though that conclusion may be premature, as I will summarise below), so it's
        worth considering the same question in terms of life-span 
        potential (the life span of the luckiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>). Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> again
        illustrates this: those who get <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-generation therapies only just in time will in fact
        be unlikely to live <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 20â€“30 years</TIMEX> more than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, because they will spend
        many frail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> with a short remaining life expectancy (i.e., a high risk of imminent
        death), whereas those only a little younger will never get that frail and will spend rather
        few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> even in biological middle age. Quantitatively, what this means is that if a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
        per year decline of mortality rates at all ages is achieved and sustained indefinitely,
        then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 1000-year-old</TIMEX> is probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 5â€“10 years</TIMEX> younger than the first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150-year-old</TIMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> oversight that I observe in contemporary commentaries on life extension, among
        which 
        Coping with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methuselah</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, is the most significant because
        of its urgency. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-generation rejuvenation therapies, whenever they arrive, will surely
        build on a string of prior laboratory achievements. Those achievements, it seems to me,
        will have progressively worn down humanity's evidently desperate determination to close its
        eyes to the prospect of defeating its foremost remaining scourge anytime soon. The problem
        (if we can call it that) is that this wearing-down may have been completed long before the
        rejuvenation therapies arrive. There will come an advanceâ€”probably a single laboratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resultâ€”that</ENAMEX> breaks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camel</ENAMEX>'s back and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> society to abandon that denial: to accept
        that the risk of getting one's hopes up and seeing them dashed is now outweighed by the
        risk of missing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> by inaction. What will that result be? I think a conservative
        guess is a trebling of the remaining life span of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of a long-lived strain that have
        reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of their normal life span before treatment begins. This would possess
        what I claim are the key necessary features: a big life extension, in something furry and
        not congenitally sick, from treatment begun in middle age.
        It is the prospect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEV</ENAMEX>, of course, that makes this juncture so pivotal. It seems
        quite certain to me that the announcement of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> will cause huge, essentially
        immediate, society-wide changes in lifestyle and expenditure choicesâ€”in a word,
        pandemoniumâ€”resulting from the anticipation that extreme human life extension might arrive
        soon enough to benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> already alive. We will probably not have effective
        rejuvenation therapies for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 25 years</TIMEX>, and it could certainly be 100
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. But given the present status of the therapies listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, we have, in my
        view, a high probability of reaching the mouse life extension milestone just described
        (which I call â<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">€˜robust mouse rejuvenationâ€™</ENAMEX>) within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just</TIMEX> 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>, given adequate and focused funding (perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> per
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>). And nobody in 
        Coping with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methuselah</ENAMEX> said so. This timeframe could be way off, of
        course, but as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Wade</ENAMEX> notes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 57</ENAMEX>), big advances often occur much sooner than most experts
        expect. Even the most obvious of these lifestyle changesâ€”greater expenditure on traditional
        medical care, avoidance of socially vital but risky professionsâ€”could severely destabilise
        the global economy; those better versed in economics and sociology than I would doubtless
        be even more pessimistic about our ability to negotiate this period smoothly.
        Overpopulation, probably the most frequently cited drawback of curing aging, could not
        result for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many decades</TIMEX>, but the same cannot be said for breadth of access irrespective of
        ability to pay: in a post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> world, restricted availability of rejuvenation therapies
        resembling that seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> would invite violence on a scale that, shall we
        say, might be worth trying to avoid.
        Am I, then, resigned to a future in which countless <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> are denied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many decades</TIMEX> of
        life by our studied reluctance to plan ahead <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>? Not quite. The way out is pointed to in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuljapurkar's</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) graph of the average wealth consumed and generated by an
        individual as a function of age, reproduced in 
        Coping with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methuselah</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 143</ENAMEX>). Once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEV</ENAMEX> is achieved, there will be no
        going back: rejuvenation research will be intense forever thereafter and will anticipate
        and remedy the life-threatening degenerative changes appearing at newly achieved ages with
        ever-increasing efficacy and lead time. This will bring about the greatest economic change
        of all in society: the elimination of retirement benefits. Retirement benefits are for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frail people</ENAMEX>, and there won't 
        be any frail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The graph just mentioned amply illustrates how much
        wealth will be released by this. My hope, therefore, is that once policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> begin to
        realise what's coming they will factor in this eventual windfall and allocate sufficient
        short-term resources to make the period of limited availability of rejuvenation therapies
        brief enough to prevent mayhem. This will, however, be possible only if such resources
        begin to be set aside long enough in advanceâ€”and we don't know how long we have.
