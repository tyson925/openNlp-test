        form from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>? How do voting patterns emerge? Such a diverse array of problems
        seems completely unrelated. However, they all involve ‚Äúemergence of complexity.‚Äù When
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> come together, they form patterns, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that cannot be
        discerned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> alone. The study of the emergence of complexity is one of
        the most active and important areas of research. It is important not only for understanding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, but also for technological applications, including the fabrication of large-scale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> nanocircuits using a bottom-up approach, and the preparation of multifunctional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúsmart‚Äù</ENAMEX> nanomaterials.
        DNA evolved to be the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> of genetic information because of its
        extraordinary chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>. These same properties also make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> an excellent system
        for the study of self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and self-organization. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> complementary molecules of
        single-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> have paired <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that bond with each other and form the well-known
        double helix structure. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> molecules of double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (duplexes) can further
        associate together if they have complementary single-stranded overhangs (sticky ends).
        Intermolecular interactions can be precisely predicted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watson‚</ENAMEX>ÄìCrick basepairing (adenine
        to thymidine and guanine to cytosine). And, these interactions are structurally understood
        at the atomic level. Given the diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>, we can easily engineer a
        large number of pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA duplexes</ENAMEX> that associate with each other with sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> and in a well-defined fashion. This property is not common among other
        molecular systems. Small organic and inorganic molecular pairs can interact with each other
        with specificity and in well-defined structures, but the number of such pairs is limited
        and their chemistry varies greatly. Protein molecules, such as antibody‚Äìantigen pairs, have
        great diversity and high specificity. However, it is extremely difficult, if not
        impossible, to predict how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> interact with each other. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">molecular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> fulfills all the aforementioned criteria.
        In nature, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> occurs predominantly as a linear molecule, and if its conformations were
        limited to linearity, it would not be very useful for studying self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Fortunately,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">branched DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> can be engineered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holliday</ENAMEX> junctions, for example, are
        intermediates that occur during genetic recombination. To model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holliday</ENAMEX> junctions, a
        stable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-arm junction has been constructed in which, by design, no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strands</ENAMEX> are fully
        complementary to each other (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kallenback et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seeman 2003)</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). For example,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5‚</NUMEX>Ä≤ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of strand 2 is complementary to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3‚</NUMEX>Ä≤ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3‚</NUMEX>Ä≤ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">strand 2</ENAMEX> is complementary to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5‚</NUMEX>Ä≤ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strand 3</ENAMEX> instead of that of strand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Combining
        branched structures and the excellent molecular recognition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, we are ready to
        engineer complicated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA nanostructures</ENAMEX> and use them for studying self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>.
        Extensive studies have shown that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-arm junction adopts an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-shape structure
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>) under physiological conditions, and the angle between its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> helical domains
        can vary widely (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lilley 2000).</ENAMEX> It is impossible to construct well-defined large structures
        from flexible components. To overcome this problem, several well-behaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> motifs have
        been engineered. Double crossover (DX) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Seeman 1993</ENAMEX>) and triple crossover (TX)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LaBean et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) molecules are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> early examples (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1C and 1D</TIMEX>). In such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> duplexes lie side by side. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">duplexes</ENAMEX> are joined
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crossovers, which prevent any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> from twisting against its neighbor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, the interhelical angles become fixed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0¬∞</NUMEX>. Other motifs quickly followed, including
        the paranemic crossover motif (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shen et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rhombus</ENAMEX>/parallelogram motif (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mao et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), cross motif (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yan et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), and several triangle motifs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelyapov et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ding et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu et al. 2004).</ENAMEX> They all are stable, rigid, and readily designed for
        self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> simple example of self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> is the formation of two-dimensional (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2D</NUMEX>) periodic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> or 2D crystals. This is also one of the greatest successes in the field of DNA
        self-assembly (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> 2D <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> crystals were assembled from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DX</ENAMEX> motifs (Winfree
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 1998</ENAMEX>). In a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2D crystal</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DX</ENAMEX> molecule contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sticky ends (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A‚ÄìA‚Ä≤</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B‚ÄìB‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>)
        distributed on its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component duplexes</ENAMEX>. The complementarity of the sticky ends is
        designed in such a way that a DX molecule will interact with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DX</ENAMEX> molecules
        through its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sticky ends. Any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DX</ENAMEX> molecules can interact with each other though only
        one pair of sticky ends. Any pair of sticky end interactions will position the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> DX
        molecules in a conformation such that no other sticky ends from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecules are in
        sufficient proximity to interact. As a result of this design, regularly ordered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX> arrays
        have formed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Following similar strategies, others have designed DNA motifs to
        assemble into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2D</NUMEX> arrays, whose symmetries include tetragonal (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yan et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudohexagonal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mao et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), and hexagonal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chelyapov el</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ding et al. 2004</ENAMEX>).
        Inspired by early theoretical suggestions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Winfree 1998</ENAMEX>), experimental exploration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">aperiodic</ENAMEX> self-assembly immediately followed. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study applied algorithmic self-assembly
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TX</ENAMEX> molecules (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao et al. 2000).</ENAMEX> The assembling rule ‚Äúexclusive OR‚Äù (XOR) is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TX</ENAMEX> molecules. Consider the value of all inputs and outputs as either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XOR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> inputs are the same, the output will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>; otherwise, the output
        will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. If molecules <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> are the input and output, respectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
        i molecule takes the input from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        i and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
        i‚àí1 molecules. In other words, the values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        i and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
        i‚àí1 molecules determine what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> molecule will be incorporated. There are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> molecules, whose inputs are (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 1</ENAMEX>), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 0</ENAMEX>), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 1</ENAMEX>), and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0, 0</ENAMEX>).
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> molecules are enough to satisfy any input combination. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> C
        molecules connect the input and output molecules, which is necessary for the
        characterization but not essential for the self-assembly process. Sticky ends between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
        molecules and the C molecules are longer than those between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> molecules and between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>
        or C molecules. Thus, the C and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> molecules assemble <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to form the inputs because the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between longer sticky ends is more stable than those between the shorter ones.
        Then the output <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> molecules assemble to the assembled C and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> molecules. In that study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2000</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different input combinations were used, and one of them is shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The resulting DNA structures are periodic with respect to the backbones, but they
        are aperiodic in their sequences. Though the resulting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four-byte one-dimensional</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1D</NUMEX>)
        structures are quite simple, this study demonstrated that aperiodic structures are
        achievable through self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winfree</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> have extended the algorithmic self-assembly strategy from 1D
        to 2D (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothemund et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). This achievement is certainly a milestone in the field of
        self-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. It overcomes a great challenge, as the structural complexity dramatically
        increases from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1D</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2D</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have applied the same XOR algorithms
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">DX</ENAMEX> molecules in their study and achieved fractal structures, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierpinski</ENAMEX> triangles
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). External inputs are in the bottom row. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each row</TIMEX> takes inputs from the row
        immediately below, and sends the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> outputs to the row immediately above. Each
        position takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> inputs (identical or non-identical) from lower left and lower right
        positions, and sends identical output to both upper left and upper right positions. The
        arrows indicate the direction of information flow, or assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX>. In their
        experiment, the rules are encoded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DX</ENAMEX> molecules. This study is conceptually
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX>, but the experimental challenges are tremendous. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> key challenge is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assembly fidelity</ENAMEX>. The right molecules have to compete with partially matched molecules.
        The concentrations of the competing molecules further complicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> issue, as
        some molecules could be rapidly depleted from the solution. In that sense, the current work
        is quite stunning even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> is far from perfect.
        In principle, a wide range of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX> patterns could be generated with the same set of
        molecules and the same strategy, changing only the first row of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, which
        specifies the external inputs. Realization of this goal will critically rely on the
        elimination of assembly errors, or the introduction of error corrections (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winfree</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bekbolatov 2004</ENAMEX>).
        The current work represents a neat approach to understanding the emergence of
        complexity. It integrates both simulation and wet chemistry. It also provides a plausible
        approach to nanofabrications. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>, a variety of methods have been
        developed, which use biomacromolecules as templates to fabricate nanostructures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braun el</ENAMEX>
        al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young 1998; Mucic et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Limited by the
        complexity of the available biomacromolecular templates, simple nanostructures are the
        usual result: mostly nanowires, nanoparticles, and simple aggregates of nanoparticles. The
        current work illustrates the possibility of generating more complicated structures and
        promises unprecedented structural complexity for nanomaterials.
