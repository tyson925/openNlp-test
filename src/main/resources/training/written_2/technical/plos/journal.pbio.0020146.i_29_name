          profound enough problem to dominate all the life sciences, but it contains, piece by
          piece, all the mysteries.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">” — Lewis Thomas</ENAMEX>
        
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the oldest beliefs about human perception is that we have a poor sense of smell.
        Not only is this a general belief among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but it appears to have a scientific
        basis. Recent genetic studies show a decline in the number of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor
        genes through primate evolution to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Human evolution was characterized by the gradual
        ascendance of vision and reduction of smell, evidenced in the anthropological record by the
        progressive diminution of the snout as the eyes moved to the middle of the face to subserve
        depth vision (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jones et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concurrently</ENAMEX>, the use of an arboreal habitat and the
        adoption of an erect posture moved the nose away from the ground, with its rich varieties
        of odors.
        However, some recent behavioral studies suggest that primates, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, have
        relatively good senses of smell. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution</ENAMEX> of this paradox may come from a larger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> on the biology of smell. Here we begin by reassessing several overlooked
        factors: the structure of the nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cavity</ENAMEX>, retronasal smell, olfactory brain areas, and
        language. In these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">arenas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> may have advantages which outweigh their lower numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. It appears that in the olfactory system, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor genes</ENAMEX> do not map
        directly onto behavior; rather, behavior is the outcome of multiple factors. If human smell
        perception is better than we thought, it may have played a more important role in human
        evolution than is usually acknowledged.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gene Studies</ENAMEX>
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> through the primate series to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> there is a progressive reduction in
        the proportion of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouquier et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilad et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,300</NUMEX> olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor genes</ENAMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 1,100</NUMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Firestein 2002</ENAMEX>), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 350</NUMEX>
        functional genes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,000</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glusman et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zozulya et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). The
        conclusion seems obvious: the low number of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor genes</ENAMEX> in humans
        compared with rodents—and presumably most other mammals—is directly correlated with the
        evolutionary decline in the human sense of smell.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behavioral Studies</ENAMEX>
        Although these conclusions seem incontrovertible, they are challenged by some recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behavioral</ENAMEX> studies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> type of study shows that much of the olfactory system can be
        removed with no effect on smell perception. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor genes map
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">topographically</ENAMEX> onto the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> relay <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, a sheet of modules called glomeruli in the
        olfactory bulb. Up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the glomerular layer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> can be removed without
        significant effect on olfactory detection and discrimination (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bisulco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slotnick 2003).</ENAMEX>
        If the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the glomeruli—and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor genes</ENAMEX> they represent—can
        subserve the functions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, it implies that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the human are more than
        enough to smell as well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>.
        Another type of study has tested smell perception in primates, and has shown that,
        despite their reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor gene repertoire, primates, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, have
        surprisingly good senses of smell (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laska et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Comparing the data on smell
        detection thresholds shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> not only perform as well or better than other
        primates, they also perform as well or better than other mammals. When tested for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thresholds</ENAMEX> to the odors of a series of straight-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (aliphatic) aldehydes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> do better
        on the short <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> compounds, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> perform as well or slightly better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> on
        the longer chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> perform significantly better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laska et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Similar results have been obtained with other types of odors.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> type of study demonstrating human olfactory abilities shows that in tests of
        odor detection, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> outperform the most sensitive measuring instruments such as the gas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatograph</ENAMEX>.
        These results indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are not poor smellers (a condition technically called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microsmats</ENAMEX>), but rather are relatively good, perhaps even excellent, smellers (macrosmats)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laska et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). This may come as a surprise to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, though not to those who
        make their living by their noses, such as oenologists, perfumers, and food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>.
        Anyone who has taken part in a wine tasting, or observed professional testing of food
        flavors or perfumes, knows that the human sense of smell has extraordinary capacities for
        discrimination.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mystery</ENAMEX>
        Here, then, is the mystery: how can one reconcile a relatively high sensitivity to smell
        with a relatively low number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptors</ENAMEX> in the nose? To answer this question, I
        think we need to look beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor genes</ENAMEX> and consider olfaction in its
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> behavioral context. This requires considering several overlooked aspects of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olfactory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>: the nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cavity</ENAMEX>, the oropharyngeal cavity, the olfactory brain, and the
        role of language. In this article I focus on behaviors related to conscious perception of
        ordinary smells. Pheromones, and the rich world of unconscious effects of odors and
        pheromones, are beyond the present scope (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cf. Jacob et al. 2004</ENAMEX>), though they undoubtedly
        will add to the general conclusions.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Filtering Apparatus of the Nasal</ENAMEX> Cavity
        A marked difference between the noses of primates and other mammals is that in nearly
        all nonprimate mammals, the nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cavities</ENAMEX> contain at the front a much-convoluted filtering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apparatus</ENAMEX> (formed by the ethmo- and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">maxillo-turbinals</ENAMEX>) covered with respiratory membrane.
        This filtering apparatus is a biological air conditioner (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Negus 1958)</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> key
        functions: cleaning, warming, and humidifying the inspired air. An important function of
        the filtering apparatus is presumably to protect the nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cavity</ENAMEX> from infections. In many
        mammals, air drawn into the nose is often highly contaminated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> from fecal
        material, decaying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, and noxious fumes from the environment, all
        of which attack the olfactory epithelium. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rodents</ENAMEX> are susceptible to chronic rhinitis,
        which causes substantial loss of functioning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hinds et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>).
        This filtering, however, might have negative consequences for odor detection. Warming
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">humidification</ENAMEX> presumably enhance the odor-stimulating capacity of the inhaled air, but
        cleaning would remove odor molecules by absorbing them into the lining of the epithelium,
        an effect which could be large depending on the size of the filtering apparatus. If so,
        mammals with large snouts might have a large inventory of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptors</ENAMEX> at least in
        part to offset the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">odor</ENAMEX> molecules absorbed by the filtering apparatus.
        How do these considerations relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>? The evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> involved lifting
        the nose away from the noxious ground environment as they adopted a bipedal posture (Aiello
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean 1990).</ENAMEX> This would have reduced the need for the filtering apparatus and with it
        the losses of absorbed odor molecules. The large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptors</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> would have come under reduced adaptive pressure and could accordingly be
        reduced in proportion.
        By this hypothesis, during human evolution the snout could be reduced in dimensions and
        complexity without compromising the ultimate amounts of odorized air reaching the olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX>. The reduced snout allowed the eyes to come forward and lie closer together to
        promote more effective stereoscopic vision. Thus, vision could become more dominant in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> without sacrificing unduly the sense of smell. Tests of this hypothesis are needed,
        including calculations of air flows and odor losses through the filtering apparatus in
        mammals with extensive filtering apparatuses compared with the simpler nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cavities</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primates</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humans Receive Richer Retronasal Smells</ENAMEX>
        Being carried in with inhaled air (the orthonasal route) is not the only way for odor
        molecules to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Odor</ENAMEX> molecules also reach the olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> via the retronasal route, from the back of the oral cavity through the
        nasopharynx into the back of the nasal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cavity</ENAMEX>. Although the orthonasal route is the one
        usually used to test for smell perception, the retronasal route is the main source of the
        smells we perceive from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX> within our mouths. These are the smells that
        primarily determine the hedonic (i.e., pleasurable or aversive) qualities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>, and
        that, combined with taste and somatosensation, form the complex sensation of flavor. It is
        likely, for several reasons, that this is an important route for smell in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
        First, with the adoption of bipedalism, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> became increasingly wide ranging, with
        concomitant diversification of diet and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retronasal</ENAMEX> smells. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the advent of fire,
        perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 2 million years ago</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrangham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Conklin-Brittain 2003</ENAMEX>), made the
        human diet more odorous and tasty. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> also one can begin to speak of human
        cuisines of prepared foods, with all their diversity of smells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrangham</ENAMEX> and
        Conklin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittain</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) support the view that prepared cuisines based on cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the defining characteristics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, added to the cooked cuisines were
        fermented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX>, with their own strong flavors. These developments occurred
        among the early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX>-gatherer human cultures and continued through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last ice age</TIMEX>. With
        the transition to agricultural and urban cultures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10,000 years ago</TIMEX>, human cuisines changed
        by the advent of animal domestication, plant cultivation, use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, and of complex
        procedures, such as those for producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, all of which produced foodstuffs
        that especially stimulate the smell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in the nose through the retronasal route and
        contribute to complex flavors.
        These considerations suggest the hypothesis that the retronasal route for smells has
        delivered a richer repertoire of smells in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> than in nonhuman primates and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammals</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Research on retronasal olfaction is being actively pursued
        (reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deibler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delwiche 2004).</ENAMEX> Studies are needed of the evolutionary pressures
        on this route in addition to the pressures on the evolution of the snout.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Humans Smell with Bigger and Better Brains</ENAMEX>
        Comparisons of the decreasing size of the olfactory system relative to expansion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visual</ENAMEX>, auditory, and somatosensory systems usually focus on the olfactory bulb and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olfactory</ENAMEX> tract, which are relatively small. However, what matters more are the central
        olfactory brain regions that process the olfactory input as the basis for smell
        perception.
        These regions are more extensive in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> than is usually realized. The dedicated
        olfactory regions include the olfactory cortex, the olfactory tubercle, the entorhinal
        cortex, parts of the amygdala, parts of the hypothalamus, the mediodorsal thalamus, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medial</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral orbitofrontal cortex</ENAMEX>, and parts of the insula (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neville</ENAMEX> and Haberly
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). These regions are involved in immediate processing of odor input and probably
        subserve the specific tasks of smell detection and simple smell discrimination. For more
        complex tasks, memory becomes important in comparing smells, thus involving the temporal
        and frontal lobes (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchanan et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) and the specifically human higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> areas. It may be hypothesized that these regions enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to bring far
        more cognitive power to bear on odor discrimination than is possible in the rodent and
        other mammals.
        The reduced repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor genes</ENAMEX> in the human is thus offset by the
        expanded repertoire of higher brain mechanisms. Rather than being restricted to a tiny part
        of the brain, olfactory processing of complex smells, such as those produced by human
        cuisines, draws on the enlarged processing capacity of the human brain.
      
      
        Language <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is Necessary for Human Smell</ENAMEX>
        In the enlarged processing capacity for perceiving and discriminating odors, language
        plays a critical role. This seems paradoxical, for we have great difficulty describing a
        smell in words. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insight</ENAMEX> into this difficulty comes from the finding that different smells
        are represented in the olfactory bulb by different patterns of olfactory glomerular
        activity. These patterns function as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virtual “odor images”</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xu et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> It has been
        hypothesized that these odor images provide the basis for discrimination between odors,
        analogous to the way that retinal images are the basis for discrimination of visual pattern
        stimuli. The complex patterns constituting odor images may be considered as analogous to
        the complex patterns constituting visual images of faces. And just as we are very good at
        recognizing a human face, yet have difficulty describing it in words, we have a hard time
        describing and verbally comparing odor images.
        Because of this difficulty, describing a smell or a taste in words is very demanding. A
        professional wine tasting, for example, requires many steps: analysing both orthonasal and
        retronasal perception, comparing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in memory with each other and with all other wines
        to be compared, identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> properties separate from the hedonic qualities,
        and finding the words to describe the process as it unfolds, leading to the final
        formulation to characterize the quality of the wine and identify it as distinct from all
        others. It may be characterized as hard cognitive work that only a human, among all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with olfactory organs, can do. It may be argued that this is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are
        adapted to do (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrangham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conklin-Brittain 2003).</ENAMEX>
        This cognitive work is largely independent of the numbers of peripheral receptor cells
        and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. A good analogy is with language. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 17,000–20,000</NUMEX> auditory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nerve fibers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 25,000–30,000</NUMEX> in the human (cf. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> and Masengill
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). This modest increase in the input from the peripheral auditory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> provides
        little basis for the development of human speech and language, which had much more to do
        with the increase in the central brain mechanisms that elaborate the input. It may be
        hypothesized that a similar conclusion applies to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfaction</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Implications for Systems Biology</ENAMEX>
        A general result from these considerations is that there appears not to be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>
        relation between the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory receptor genes</ENAMEX> and the detection and
        discrimination of odors. This implies that we are dealing with a fundamental problem in
        relating genes to systems behavior: a given set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may not map directly onto a given
        behavior. In this respect the mystery being addressed here is a caution for the new era of
        “systems biology” and against any belief that behavior can be related directly to genomes,
        proteomes, or any other type of “-ome.” We are reminded instead that the functional ecology
        of the body is dependent on many factors.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Much about the sense of smell seems enigmatic and conflicting. This is partly because of
        the inherent difficulties in presenting smell stimuli, and partly because there is not yet
        a recognition of all the relevant mechanisms that are involved.
        It may be hoped that the hypotheses and mechanisms discussed here can help to address
        and resolve the mystery of the apparent noncorrelation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olfactory</ENAMEX> receptor gene numbers
        with smell acuity, and in doing so stimulate a major reassessment of human smell
        perception. Such an effort cuts across many academic disciplines. Molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> need
        to continue their efforts to characterize the olfactory genomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and nonhuman
        mammals more closely, to compare how different organisms sample odor space. Physiologists
        need to devise high-throughput systems to test these odor spaces. Behavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroscientists</ENAMEX> need to develop increasingly accurate tests of olfactory function that
        enable comparisons across different species. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Psychologists</ENAMEX> need to explore even more
        vigorously the subtle ways that smells can influence human behavior. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthropologists</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paleontologists</ENAMEX> need to study the olfactory parts of the cranium and face from this new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, to reassess the role that both orthonasal and retronasal smell may have played
        in primate and human evolution.
        The factors reviewed here suggest that the sense of smell is more important in humans
        than is generally realized, which in turn suggests that it may have played a bigger role in
        the evolution of human diet, habitat, and social behavior than has been appreciated. All of
        these considerations should stimulate a greater interest in this neglected sense.
