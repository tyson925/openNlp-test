        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> called non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nucleoside</NUMEX> reverse transcriptase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (NNRTIs). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Efavirenz</ENAMEX> has the
        advantage of once-daily dosing. In a recent study called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2NN</TIMEX> study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lancet 363</ENAMEX>:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1253â€“1263</NUMEX>), it appeared to be only marginally superior to nevirapine in terms of clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> and virological suppression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Leth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have now shown that while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nevirapine</ENAMEX> and efavirenz both raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> (the â€œgoodâ€
        type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>), the overall lipid profile is better with nevirapine than with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efavirenz</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œThese</ENAMEX> data suggest that nevirapine may be preferable to efavirenz in HIV-infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with other cardiovascular risk factors,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says the study's academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carr of St. Vincent's Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Darlinghurst</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œHowever</ENAMEX>, perceived
        cardiovascular risk is only one factor that would affect the choice between these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.â€
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Leth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> prospectively analyzed the lipids of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in the
        2NN study, a randomized, open-label efficacy study that included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> who had
        never been on antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were given stavudine and lamivudine and
        were then randomized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: nevirapine, efavirenz, or both.
        For the lipid analysis, which was preplanned, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> included only the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nevirapine</ENAMEX> and efavirenz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">417 and 289</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, respectively). This was because the
        2NN study showed that simultaneous use of nevirapine and efavirenz should be avoidedâ€”the
        combination is associated with increased toxicity without increased efficacy. The increase
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> was significantly higher with nevirapine than with efavirenz. There was
        a decrease in the ratio of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> with nevirapine and an
        increase with efavirenz.
        The study does not prove, however, that the rise in HDL cholesterol seen with NNRTIs
        (especially nevirapine) actually leads to a reduction in coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>. â€œThere are
        no vascular functional data,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX>, â€œor clinical vascular endpoint data that confirm
        that the statistically significant lipid differences observed are clinically
        significant.â€
        The study was funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boehringer Ingelheim</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of nevirapine. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> clearly state that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had â€œa nonbinding input on issues of study design
        and analysesâ€ but it had â€œno influence on reporting of the data or the decision to
        publish.â€
        Despite its limitations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Leth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' study â€œmoves clinicians and patients
        away from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜one-size-fits-allâ€™ antiretroviral therapy,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œIt</ENAMEX> takes us further
        along the path of choice of antiretroviral therapy being individualized according to other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient comorbidities</ENAMEX> and risk factors, as well as therapy simplicity and side
        effects.â€
