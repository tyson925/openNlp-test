        biology for us to appreciate it fully. Moreover, the field has expanded rapidly, especially
        since the development of molecular techniques in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two to three decades</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Futuyma</ENAMEX>'s
        classic text on evolution (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> totaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">763</NUMEX> pages. To cover the
        topic in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> pages, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlesworths</ENAMEX> have done in 
        Evolution: A Very <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short Introduction</ENAMEX> , is no mean feat.
        Their book is one of a series of short introductions, published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX>
        Press, covering an eclectic array of subjects that aim to provide an accessible yet
        stimulating read for anyone wanting a thorough introduction to a topic. In this small
        volume, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlesworths</ENAMEX> have succeeded on both fronts and provide an excellent account of
        the core issues for a broad range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the reasons for the book's appeal is
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> draw on a range of carefully chosen human traits to illustrate their
        points. By contrast, most evolutionary textbooks (other than those purely on human
        evolution) tend to focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nonhuman organisms</ENAMEX>. As with traits in every other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>,
        many human and human-related characteristics have evolved via genetic drift and natural
        selection, and they provide an effective means of convincing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the reality and
        relevance of evolution. For example, to explain how mutation can cause the loss of a
        function, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> discuss the relatively poor sense of smell in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, as compared
        with many other mammals, using an example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vestigial â€˜pseudogeneâ€™</ENAMEX> of a human olfactory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor gene</ENAMEX>. They also discuss tooth decay, enzyme aesthetics, heritable differences,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, and the ability to taste and so on.
        Although the topics the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlesworths</ENAMEX> choose to focus on are certainly appropriate, they
        provide only a brief mention of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important processâ€”development. Evolutionary
        developmental biology is a burgeoning field that can provide interesting and important
        insights into our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, the absence of
        eyes in cavefish, rather than being the result of a degenerative process, might be the
        result of selection on genes that govern feeding morphology, a selection process that has
        included suppression of eye development (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pennisi 2002).</ENAMEX> Such developmental mechanisms and
        constraints can actually alter the direction of evolution. Although the key forces driving
        evolution are usually thought of as mutation, genetic drift, natural selection, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">divergence</ENAMEX>, the developmental pathways from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to phenotypes, along with associated
        developmental constraints, can also determine the rate and direction of evolution.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> discuss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> topics that have traditionally been hard to
        understand from an evolutionary point of view. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜difficult problemsâ€™</ENAMEX> are ageing,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">altruism</ENAMEX>, human consciousness, complex adaptations, and the origin of living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>.
        Difficult problems can be interpreted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: those that, although hard to solve, have
        either been explained or will eventually be explained by modern evolutionary theories, and
        those problems that cannot be fully resolved with our current understanding but leave room
        for learning about additional mechanisms or factors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Charlesworths</ENAMEX> generally consider
        only those problems of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">typeâ€”the</ENAMEX> explained ones. However, I think that some of
        the more intractable problems should be described in more detail. For instance, complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adaptation</ENAMEX> might be fully explained by mutations and natural selection, but additional
        unknown mechanisms might be essential for the evolution of the complex traits. I realize
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of modern evolutionary theory, such as creationists, have often cited these
        traditional problems to support their conclusion that modern evolutionary theory is wrong;
        but progress always depends on the consideration of new ideas, and there might be important
        mechanisms still to be discovered that play a key role in evolution. Describing potentially
        intractable problems might also spur on young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who are thinking of studying
        evolutionary biology with the hope that there are still some theoretical battles to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conquered</ENAMEX>.
        Who is the target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of this book? For many books, the topics chosen and the
        writing style can perhaps provide clues to the nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. For instance, 
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blind Watchmaker</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Dawkins</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) is a good introductory
        book for those interested in natural selection because it seems to be written mainly for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who either oppose or do not understand the role of natural selection. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlesworths</ENAMEX>' book, providing evidence for evolution occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> pages. They
        explain how the similarities between living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> can be understood in terms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evolution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3</ENAMEX>) and subsequently discuss evidence from the geographical distributions
        of living and fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>). My first impression was that this part occupies
        too large a proportion of the book. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3</ENAMEX> serves as a good introduction to the
        basic background of biology, such as the gene, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, and cells. When I read a recent article
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a teaching controversy concerning evolution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch 2003</ENAMEX>), I began to
        appreciate the importanceâ€”at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Statesâ</ENAMEX>€”of
        convincing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the reality and cogency of evolution and evolution theory by astutely
        providing them with the evidence to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> for themselves.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, there seem to be few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who deny the facts of evolution, although there
        are many ideologically motivated books opposing natural selection and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwinism</ENAMEX>. To
        convince creationists of evolution is usually extremely difficult, if not impossible,
        because they will never doubt their assumption that God created humankind. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education of</ENAMEX>
        young and curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, however, can make a difference. This is where I think the book
        will be most successful, but this book should not just be limited to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peopleâ</ENAMEX>€”I can
        recommend it to anyone who wants to know about evolution. Moreover, I can recommend it to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> not only as an introduction to evolution, but also as an exercise in
        reading a well-written and engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> text.
