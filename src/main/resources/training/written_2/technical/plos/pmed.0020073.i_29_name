        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somatic</ENAMEX> gain-of-function mutations in exons encoding the epidermal growth factor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain are found in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%</NUMEX> of non-small cell lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> (NSCLCs) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>], with higher percentages observed in east
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4,5,6</NUMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 90%</NUMEX> of NSCLC-associated mutations occur as either multi-nucleotide
        in-frame deletions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 19</TIMEX>, involving elimination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu-Arg</ENAMEX>-Glu-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>,
        or as a single nucleotide substitution at nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T‚ÜíG</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 21</TIMEX>, resulting in
        substitution of arginine for leucine at position 858 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L858R</NUMEX>). Both of these mutations are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with sensitivity to the small-molecule kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors gefitinib</ENAMEX> or erlotinib
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>]. Unfortunately, nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who experience marked improvement on these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> eventually develop progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. While 
        KRAS mutations have been associated with some cases of primary resistance
        to gefitinib or erlotinib [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], mechanisms underlying ‚Äúacquired‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsecondary‚Äù resistance
        are unknown.
        Acquired resistance to kinase-targeted anticancer therapy has been most extensively
        studied with imatinib, an inhibitor of the aberrant BCR-ABL kinase, in chronic myelogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leukemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX>). Mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX> kinase domain are found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì90%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        secondary resistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (reviewed in [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]). Such mutations, which cluster in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        distinct regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX> kinase domain (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding loop, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T315</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M351</TIMEX>, and the
        activation loop), interfere with binding of imatinib to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10,11</NUMEX>]. Crystallographic
        studies of various ABL mutants predict that most should remain sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bind ABL</ENAMEX> with less stringent structural requirements. Using this insight, new
        small-molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> have been identified that retain activity against the majority of
        imatinib-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BCR-ABL mutants</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,13</NUMEX>].
        Although imatinib inhibits different kinases in various <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> (BCR-ABL in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIT</ENAMEX> or
        PDGFR-alpha in gastrointestinal stromal tumors [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GISTs</ENAMEX>], and PDGFR-alpha in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hypereosinophilic</ENAMEX> syndrome [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HES</ENAMEX>]) (reviewed in [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]), some tumors that become refractory to
        treatment with imatinib appear to have analogous secondary mutations in the kinase-coding
        domain of the genes encoding these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> enzymes. For example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX>, a commonly found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">C‚ÜíT</ENAMEX> single nucleotide change that replaces threonine with isoleucine at
        position 315 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T315I</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX> kinase domain [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10,11</NUMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GIST</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HES</ENAMEX>, respectively, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">analogous T670I</ENAMEX> mutation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KIT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T674I</ENAMEX> mutation in PDGFR-alpha have been associated with
        acquired resistance to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,16</NUMEX>].
        To determine whether lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> that acquire clinical resistance to either gefitinib
        or erlotinib display additional mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase domain, we have examined the
        status of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 to 24</TIMEX> in tumors from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who initially responded
        but subsequently progressed while on these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. These exons were also assessed in tumor
        cells from a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> whose disease rapidly recurred while on gefitinib therapy after
        complete gross tumor resection. Because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of 
        KRAS mutations with primary resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], we
        also examined the status of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> in tumor cells from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In an effort to explain the
        selective advantage of cells with a newly identified ‚Äúresistance‚Äù mutation in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR‚</ENAMEX>Äî a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitution‚</ENAMEX>Äîwe further characterized the drug
        sensitivity of putatively resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> mutants versus wild-type or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>-sensitive EGFR
        mutants, using both a NSCLC cell line fortuitously found to contain the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation and
        lysates from cells transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> cDNAs.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tissue Procurement</ENAMEX>
          Tumor specimens, including paraffin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, fine needle biopsies, and pleural
          effusions, were obtained through protocols approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</ENAMEX> (protocol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92‚Äì055</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] and protocol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">04‚Äì103</NUMEX> [Protocol
          S1]). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> provided informed consent.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutational Analyses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung Tumors</ENAMEX>
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from tumor specimens, and primers for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exons 18‚Äì24</ENAMEX>) and 
          KRAS2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 2</ENAMEX>) analyses were as published [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,7</NUMEX>]. All sequencing
          reactions were performed in both forward and reverse directions, and all mutations were
          confirmed at least twice from independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> isolates.
          A specific exon 20 mutation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T790M</NUMEX>) was also detected by length analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled (FAM) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products on a capillary electrophoresis device (ABI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3100</TIMEX>
          Avant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems, Foster City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), based on a new NlaIII
          restriction site created by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T790M</TIMEX> mutation (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C‚ÜíT</ENAMEX>), using the following primers:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ex20F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤-FAM- CTCCCTCCAGGAAGCCTACGTGAT-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ex20R 5‚</ENAMEX>Ä≤-
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TTTGCGATCTGCACACACCA-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>. Using serially mixed dilutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> cell lines
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H1975</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L858R- and T790M-positive</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2030</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> wild-type) for calibration, this assay detects the presence of the
          T790M mutation when H1975 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> or more of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tested, compared to a
          sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> for direct sequencing (data not shown).
        
        
          RT-PCR
          The following primers were used to generate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> cDNA fragments spanning exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">EGFR 2095F 5‚Ä≤-</ENAMEX>

          ligated into plasmids using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPO TA</ENAMEX>-cloning kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>), as per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. Minipreps of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from individual
          clones were sequenced using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T7</NUMEX> priming site of the cloning vector.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Functional Analyses of Mutant</ENAMEX> EGFRs
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> numbering systems are used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> denotes the initiating methionine
          in the signal sequence as amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid ‚àí24</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, used here, denotes the methionine
          as amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid +1</ENAMEX>. Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of antibodies, such as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y1068</NUMEX>-specific
          anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">phospho</NUMEX>-EGFR, use the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> nomenclature. To be consistent, we consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y1068</ENAMEX> as
          Y1092. Likewise, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T790M</TIMEX> mutation reported here has also been called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T766M</ENAMEX>. Mutations
          were introduced into full-length wild-type and mutant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> cDNAs using a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit</ENAMEX>

          described [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The following primers were used to generate the deletion (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX>)

          All mutant clones were fully re-sequenced bidirectionally to ensure that no additional
          mutations were introduced. Various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFRs</ENAMEX> were transiently expressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">293T</TIMEX> human
          embryonic kidney cells as published [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Cells were treated with different concentrations
          of gefitinib or erlotinib.

          were then incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> h in the continued presence of gefitinib or erlotinib.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viability Assay</ENAMEX>
          Cell viability was assayed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcein AM</ENAMEX> (acetoxymethyl ester of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcein, Molecular</ENAMEX>

          Case Reports
          We identified secondary

          either gefitinib or erlotinib (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Brief case histories of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
          presented below.
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 1</ENAMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 63-y-old</TIMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnever smoker‚Äù</ENAMEX> (smoked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 100</NUMEX> cigarettes in her

            pleural effusion. Transbronchial biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Disease progressed on
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of systemic chemotherapy, after which gefitinib, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">250 mg</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, was started.
            Comparison of chest radiographs obtained prior to starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gefitinib</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1A</TIMEX>, left
            panel) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 wk later</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1A</TIMEX>, middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) showed dramatic improvement. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months later</TIMEX>, a chest radiograph revealed progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1A</TIMEX>, right
            panel). Subsequently, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT)‚Äìguided biopsy of
            an area in the right lung base (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Despite continued treatment
            with gefitinib, either with chemotherapy or at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">500 mg</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, the pleural effusion
            recurred, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> mo after initiating gefitinib (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). Pleural fluid was
            obtained for molecular studies. In total, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tumor specimens
            available for analysis: the original lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor biopsy</ENAMEX>, a biopsy of the progressing
            lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesion</ENAMEX>, and pleural fluid. However, re-review of the original transbronchial
            biopsy showed that it had scant tumor cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 2</ENAMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> began erlotinib, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">150 mg</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. A baseline CT scan of the chest demonstrated
            innumerable bilateral nodules (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1B</TIMEX>, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), which were markedly reduced in
            number and size 4 mo after treatment (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1B</TIMEX>, middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> mo of
            therapy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s dose of erlotinib was decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mg <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> owing to
            fatigue. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> mo of treatment with erlotinib, a CT scan demonstrated an enlarging
            sclerotic lesion in the thoracic spine. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> underwent CT-guided biopsy of this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), and the erlotinib dose was increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> mg <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.
            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> mo of treatment, she progressed within the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1B</TIMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
            Erlotinib was discontinued, and a fluoroscopically guided core needle biopsy was
            performed at a site of progressive disease in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In
            total, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tumor specimens available for analysis: the original
            resected lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>, the biopsy of the enlarging spinal lesion, and the biopsy of the
            progressing lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 55-y-old</TIMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnever smoker‚Äù</ENAMEX> was treated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 4.5</NUMEX> y with weekly

            features involving her left lower lobe, pleura, and mediastinal lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>. Treatment
            was discontinued owing to fatigue. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resection</ENAMEX>. Because of metastatic involvement of multiple mediastinal lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> and
            clinical features known at that time to be predictive of response to gefitinib (female,
            never smoker, bronchioloalveolar variant histology), she was placed on ‚Äúadjuvant‚Äù
            gefitinib <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 mo later</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1C</TIMEX>, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was discontinued after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mo
            when she developed a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>sided malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pleural effusion</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1C</TIMEX>, middle
            panel). Despite drainage and systemic chemotherapy, the pleural effusion recurred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mo
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1C</TIMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>), at which time pleural fluid was collected for

          Sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors</ENAMEX>
          We screened all available tumor samples from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for previously
          described drug-sensitive 
          EGFR mutations, by direct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequencing of exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 and 21</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> showed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T‚ÜíG</ENAMEX> change at nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX>, resulting in the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          L858R amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> substitution commonly observed in drug-responsive tumors. This mutation
          was present in the biopsy material from the progressing lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesion</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S2A</TIMEX>, upper
          panels) and from cells from the pleural effusion (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S2A</TIMEX>, lower panels), both of
          which on cytopathologic examination consisted of a majority of tumor cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Interestingly, comparisons of the tracings suggest that an increase in copy number of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> allele may have occurred. Specifically, while the ratio of wild-type (nucleotide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>) to mutant (nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) peaks at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 1:1 or 1:2 in the</TIMEX>
          lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biopsy specimen</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S2A</TIMEX>, upper panels), sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the pleural fluid
          cells demonstrated a dominant mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> peak (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S2A</TIMEX>, lower panels). Consistent with
          this, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) noted at nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2361</TIMEX> (A or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>)
          demonstrated a corresponding change in the ratios of A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio in the
          transbronchial biopsy, and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio in the pleural fluid (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). Notably,
          we did not detect the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX> T‚ÜíG mutation in the original transbronchial biopsy specimen
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; data not shown). As stated above, this latter specimen contained scant tumor
          cells, most likely fewer than needed for detection of an 
          EGFR mutation by direct sequencing (see [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> specimens from patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, including the original lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> and the two
          metastatic samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and lung, showed an exon 19 deletion involving elimination
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11 nucleotides</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2238‚Äì2248</ENAMEX>) and insertion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nucleotides, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S2B</TIMEX>, all
          panels; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These nucleotide changes delete amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids L747‚ÄìE749</ENAMEX> and change amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid 750</ENAMEX> from alanine to proline (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A750P</NUMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L747‚ÄìE749</ENAMEX>;A750P mutation was previously
          reported with different nucleotide changes [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. In all samples from patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the
          wild-type sequence predominated at a ratio of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 3:1</TIMEX> over the mutant sequence.
          Both of the available tumor samples from patient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX> contained a deletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2236‚Äì2250</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 19</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; data not shown), resulting in elimination of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E746‚ÄìA750</ENAMEX>). This specific deletion has been previously reported
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The ratio of mutant to wild-type peaks was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> in both specimens (data
          not shown).
          Collectively, these results demonstrate that tumors from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> contain 
          EGFR mutations associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors gefitinib</ENAMEX> and erlotinib. In addition, these data show that within individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, metastatic or recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to the spine, lung, and pleural fluid contain
          the same mutations. These latter observations support the idea that relapsing and
          metastatic tumor cells within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are derived from original progenitor
          clones.

          Progressed while on Treatment with Either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gefitinib</ENAMEX> or Erlotinib
          To determine whether additional mutations in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase domain were associated with progression of disease in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we performed direct sequencing of all of the exons (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 through 24</TIMEX>) encoding the
          EGFR catalytic region in the available tumor specimens.
          Analysis of patient 1's pre-gefitinib specimen, which contained scant tumor cells
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; see above), not surprisingly showed only wild-type 
          EGFR sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; data not shown). However, careful analysis of
          the exon 20 sequence chromatograms in both forward and reverse directions from this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">biopsy</ENAMEX> specimen obtained after disease progression on gefitinib
          demonstrated an additional small peak at nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX>, suggesting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C‚ÜíT</ENAMEX> mutation
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This nucleotide change leads to substitution of
          methionine for threonine at position 790 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T790M</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">2369 C‚ÜíT mutant</ENAMEX> peak was even more
          prominent in cells from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s pleural fluid, which were obtained after further
          disease progression on gefitinib (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, lower panels; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The increase in the
          ratio of mutant to wild-type peaks obtained from analyses of the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">specimen</ENAMEX> and
          pleural fluid paralleled the increase in the ratio of the mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> peak (leading to the
          L858R mutation) to the wild-type T peak at nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX> (see above; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S2A</NUMEX>), as
          well as the increase in the ratio of the A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> SNP at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2361</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>).
          Collectively, these findings imply that the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> T790M mutation was present on the
          same allele as the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> L858R mutation, and that a subclone of cells harboring these
          mutations emerged during drug treatment.
          In patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, the tumor-rich sample obtained prior to treatment with erlotinib did not
          contain any additional mutations in the exons encoding the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase domain (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). By
          contrast, her progressing bone and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> contained an additional small peak at
          nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX>, suggesting the existence of a subclone of tumor cells with the same C‚ÜíT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> observed in patient 1 (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, middle and lower panels; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          relative sizes of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T mutant</ENAMEX> peaks seen in these latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> samples appeared to
          correlate with the relative size of the corresponding peaks of the exon 19 deletion
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S2B</NUMEX>). Interestingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> at nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2361</TIMEX> (A or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>) was detected in
          specimens from patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> before but not after treatment with erlotinib, suggesting that
          one 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> underwent amplification or deletion during the course of
          treatment (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S2B</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Patient 3</ENAMEX> showed results analogous to those of patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. A tumor-rich pre-treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX> did not demonstrate 
          EGFR mutations other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E746‚ÄìA750</ENAMEX> exon 19 deletion;
          specifically, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 20</TIMEX>, no secondary changes were detected (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>, upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>). However, analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the pleural effusion that developed
          after treatment with gefitinib showed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C‚ÜíT</ENAMEX> mutation at nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>, lower panels; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation described above.
          There was no dramatic change between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in the ratio of the A:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> SNP at
          position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2361</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant 2369 T</ENAMEX> peak was small, possibly because gefitinib had been
          discontinued in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mo at the time pleural fluid tumor cells were
          collected; thus, there was no selective advantage conferred upon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> bearing the T790M
          mutation.
          To determine whether the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> C‚ÜíT mutation was a previously overlooked 
          EGFR mutation found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLCs</ENAMEX>, we re-reviewed exon 20 sequence tracings
          derived from analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> fresh-frozen resected tumors [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> paraffin-embedded
          tumors [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], all of which were removed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> prior to treatment with an EGFR
          tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We did not detect any evidence of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation in these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX> tumors (data not shown; see Discussion). Collectively, our results suggest that the
          T790M mutation is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> that progress while on gefitinib or erlotinib.
          Moreover, at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2</TIMEX>, the subclones of tumor cells bearing this
          mutation probably emerged between the time of initial treatment with a tyrosine kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> and the appearance of drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (case histories not described here) with lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> who improved but subsequently progressed on therapy with either gefitinib
          or erlotinib, we examined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from tumor specimens obtained during disease progression.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we found 
          EGFR mutations associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> sensitivity (all exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deletions</ENAMEX>). However, we did not find any additional mutations in exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 to 24</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C‚ÜíT</ENAMEX> change at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> (data not shown). These
          results imply that alternative mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired</ENAMEX> drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> exist.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Progressive Tumors Lack KRAS Mutations</ENAMEX>
          Mutations in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of 
          KRAS2 occur in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-fourth</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLCs</ENAMEX>. Such mutations rarely, if
          ever, accompany 
          EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to gefitinib
          or erlotinib [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. To evaluate the possibility that secondary 
          KRAS mutations confer acquired resistance to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, we performed
          mutational profiling of 
          KRAS2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 2</ENAMEX> from tumor specimens from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 3</TIMEX>, as well as the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> lacking evidence of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation. None of the specimens
          contained any changes in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; data not shown), indicating that 
          KRAS mutations were not responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> and tumor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          An <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Established NSCLC Cell Line Also Contains Both T790M and L858R Mutations</ENAMEX>
          We profiled the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase domain (exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 to 24</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> established NSCLC lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Surprisingly,
          one cell line‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ÄîH1975‚Äîcontained</TIMEX> the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C‚ÜíT</ENAMEX> mutation at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T790M</NUMEX>) as described
          above (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). This cell line had previously been shown by others to
          contain a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX> T‚ÜíG mutation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 21</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L858R</NUMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], which we confirmed (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>, upper
          panel); in addition, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H1975</TIMEX> was reported to be more sensitive to gefitinib inhibition than
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> cell lines bearing wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Only exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 and 21</TIMEX> were apparently examined in this
          published study.
          In our own analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H1975</TIMEX> (exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 to 24</NUMEX>), the mutant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> peak resulting in the
          T790M amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitution</ENAMEX> was dominant, suggesting an increase in copy number of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> allele in comparison to the wild-type allele. The ratio of mutant to wild-type
          peaks was similar to that of the mutant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> (corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L858R</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substitution</ENAMEX>) to wild-type T peaks (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>, all panels), implying that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> and
          L858R mutations were in the same amplified allele. To further investigate this
          possibility, we performed RT-PCR to generate cDNAs that spanned exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and included sequences from exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 and 21</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were then
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cloned</ENAMEX>, and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were analyzed for 
          EGFR mutations. Sequencing chromatograms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX> showed both the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C‚ÜíT</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2573</TIMEX> T‚ÜíG mutations, confirming that both mutations
          were in the same allele (data not shown).
          Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> cell lines carried either 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> or 
          KRAS mutations, but none had both (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). As reported, H3255
          contained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an L858R</TIMEX> mutation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H1650</TIMEX> contained an exon 19 deletion [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. No other
          cell lines analyzed contained additional mutations in the exons encoding the EGFR
          tyrosine kinase domain.
        
        
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Novel PCR Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Assay Independently Confirms</ENAMEX>
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Absence or Presence of the T790M Mutation</ENAMEX>
          As stated above, the mutant peaks suggestive of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> were small
          in some sequence chromatograms. To eliminate the possibility that these peaks were due to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">background ‚Äúnoise</ENAMEX>,‚Äù we sought to confirm the presence of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> C‚ÜíT mutation in
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, by developing an independent test, based on a fluorescence detection
          assay that takes advantage of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
          generated by the specific missense mutation. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification with
          exon-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> spanning nucleotide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX>, wild-type sequence contains specific
          NlaIII <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, which upon digestion yield a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">106-bp</ENAMEX> product (see Methods; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>).
          Presence of the mutant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> nucleotide creates a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NlaIII</ENAMEX> restriction digest site,
          yielding a slightly shorter product (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">97 bp</TIMEX>), readily detected by fluorescent capillary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX>. This test is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX> -fold more sensitive than direct sequencing (see
          Methods; data not shown).
          We first used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H1975</TIMEX> cell line (which contains both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T790M</ENAMEX> and L858R
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutations</ENAMEX>) to confirm the specificity of the PCR-RFLP assay. As expected, analysis of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> produced both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX>-bp fragments. By contrast, analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from
          H2030 (which contains wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) showed only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX>-bp fragment (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). These data
          show that this test can readily indicate the absence or presence of the mutant allele in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX>. However, this test was only semi-quantitative, as the ratio of the mutant
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>-bp product versus the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">106-bp</ENAMEX> product varied in independent experiments from
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 2</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.
          We next used this PCR-RFLP assay to assess various patient samples for the presence of
          the specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> C‚ÜíT mutation corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitution</ENAMEX>. DNA
          from the progressing bone and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in patient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> produced both the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX>-bp
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragments</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the original lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> did not (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). The ratio of mutant
          to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> was higher in the cells from the pleural fluid, consistent with the
          higher peaks seen on the chromatograms from direct sequencing of exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>).
          Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">progressive lesions</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 3</TIMEX> yielded both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX>-bp
          fragments in the PCR-RFLP assay (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>), whereas the pre-treatment specimens did not
          produce the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>-bp product. Collectively, these data from an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> confirm
          that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T790M</TIMEX> mutation was present in progressing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. We
          were also unable to detect the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation in any specimens from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> that failed to demonstrate secondary mutations in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 to 24</TIMEX> by direct sequencing (data not shown).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical Properties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> Mutants
          To determine how the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation would affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> already containing
          mutations associated with sensitivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, we introduced
          the specific mutation into 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> cDNAs that encoded the exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 and 19</TIMEX> mutations found in patients
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>, respectively. Corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> ([i] <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L858R</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L858R plus T790M</ENAMEX>, [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ii</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX>
          L747‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ÄìE749</TIMEX>;<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A750P</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L747‚ÄìE749;A750P plus T790M</ENAMEX>, and [<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">iii</ENAMEX>] wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGFR</ENAMEX> and
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGFR</ENAMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T790M</NUMEX>) were then produced by transient transfection with expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293T</NUMEX> cells, which have very low levels of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Various lysates
          from cells that were serum-starved and pre-treated with gefitinib or erlotinib were
          analyzed by immunoblotting. Amounts of total EGFR (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t-EGFR</ENAMEX>) were determined using an
          anti-EGFR monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, and actin served as an indicator of relative levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> per sample. To assess the drug sensitivity of the various EGFR kinases in
          surrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">assays</ENAMEX>, we used a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y1092</NUMEX>-phosphate-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (i.e., phospho-EGFR
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">p-EGFR</ENAMEX>]) to measure the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúautophosphorylated‚Äù Tyr-1092</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> in relation to
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t-EGFR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. We also assessed the global pattern and levels of induced
          tyrosine phosphorylation of cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by using a generalized anti-phosphotyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> (RC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gefitinib</ENAMEX> inhibited the activity of wild-type and L858R <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFRs</ENAMEX> progressively with
          increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, as demonstrated by a reduction of
          tyrosine-phosphorylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>) and a decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-EGFR:t-EGFR ratios
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). By contrast, wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant EGFRs</ENAMEX> containing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation did
          not display a significant change in either phosphotyrosine induction or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-EGFR:t-EGFR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ratios</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4A and 4B</TIMEX>). Similar results were obtained using erlotinib against
          wild-type and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E747‚ÄìL747</ENAMEX>;A750P <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFRs</ENAMEX> in comparison to the corresponding mutants
          containing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>). These results suggest that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation
          may impair the ability of gefitinib or erlotinib to inhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase
          activity, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> mutants (i.e., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L858R</TIMEX> or an exon 19 deletion) that are clinically
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> sensitivity.
        
        
          Resistance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NSCLC Cell Line Harboring Both T790M and L858R Mutations to</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gefitinib</ENAMEX> or Erlotinib
          To further explore the functional consequences of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation, we determined
          the sensitivity of various NSCLC cells lines grown in the presence of either gefitinib or
          erlotinib, using an assay based upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcein AM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uptake</ENAMEX> and retention of this fluorogenic
          esterase substrate by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>- versus drug-treated live cells allows for a comparison of
          relative cell viability among cell lines [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H3255</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line, which harbors the
          L858R mutation and no other 
          EGFR TK domain mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), was sensitive to treatment with
          gefitinib, with an IC
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.01 Œºmol</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). By contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H1975</TIMEX> cell line,
          which contains both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L858R and T790M</TIMEX> mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX>-fold less
          sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, with an IC
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 1 Œºmol</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In fact, the sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H1975</NUMEX> cells
          was more similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H2030</TIMEX>, which contains wild-type 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> (exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 to 24</NUMEX>) and mutant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Very similar results were obtained with erlotinib
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S3</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Specific mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> are associated with sensitivity to either gefitinib or erlotinib,
        but mechanisms of acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> have not yet been reported. Based upon analogous
        studies in other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> with another kinase inhibitor, imatinib, a single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        substitution from threonine to methionine at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">790</NUMEX> in the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> was predicted to lead to drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, even before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> and
        21 mutations of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">responsiveness</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> was reported. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation
        was shown in vitro in the context of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGFR</ENAMEX> to confer resistance to gefitinib [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]
        and a related quinazoline inhibitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PD153035</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        We show here, through molecular analysis of tumor material from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and one
        NSCLC cell line, as well as additional biochemical studies, that acquired clinical drug
        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib is indeed associated with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, we find that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation confers drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> not just to wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> but also to mutant EGFRs associated with clinical responsiveness to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> tyrosine
        kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>]. Our results further demonstrate that an analogous mechanism of
        acquired resistance exists for imatinib and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>),
        despite the fact that the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agents target</ENAMEX> different kinases in distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        In tumors from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> not treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2369</TIMEX> C‚ÜíT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T790M</NUMEX>) appears to be extremely rare. We have not identified this mutation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> (see above), and among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1,300</NUMEX> lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> in which analysis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 to 21</TIMEX> has been performed [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,4,5,6</NUMEX>], only one tumor
        (which also harbored an L858R mutation) was reported to contain the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation. Whether
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from which this tumor was resected had received gefitinib or erlotinib is
        unclear, and the report did not note an association with acquired resistance to either drug
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        How tumor cells bearing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation emerge within gefitinib- or erlotinib-treated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is a matter of investigation. Subclones bearing this mutation could arise de novo
        during treatment
        . However, based upon analogous studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX>, it is also possible that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NSCLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subclones</ENAMEX> bearing this secondary mutation pre-exist within the primary tumor clone in
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, albeit at low frequency [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. In either scenario, treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gefitinib</ENAMEX> or erlotinib subsequently allows these resistant subclones to become apparent,
        because most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> bearing sensitivity-conferring mutations die, while cells with the T790M
        mutation persist.
        From analysis of the crystal structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase domain bound to erlotinib, it
        is has been shown that the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">threonine residue</ENAMEX> at position 790 is located in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophobic ATP</ENAMEX>-binding pocket of the catalytic region, where it forms a critical hydrogen
        bond with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. The related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>, gefitinib, is predicted to interact with
        this threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> as well. Substitution of the threonine at position 790 by a larger
        residue like methionine would probably result in steric clash with the aromatic moieties on
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> would likely not depend on the accessibility of the
        same hydrophobic cavity and is therefore probably not affected by the incorporation of a
        bulky methionine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chain</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Consistent with this, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T790M</TIMEX> mutation has been shown
        not to abrogate the catalytic activity of wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGFR</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation could also affect the kinase activity or alter the substrate
        specificity of mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFRs</ENAMEX>, such that a proliferative advantage would be conferred upon
        cells bearing the mutation. Consistent with this, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H1975</TIMEX> NSCLC cell line reported here
        to contain both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T790M and L858R</TIMEX> did not to our knowledge undergo any prior treatment with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gefitinib</ENAMEX> or erlotinib; the doubly mutated cells must have become dominant over time
        through multiple passages in vitro. This scenario could explain the seemingly contradictory
        report by others who found the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H1975</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line to be highly sensitive to gefitinib [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>];
        our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H1975</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> could represent a subclone that emerged over time. Analysis of earlier
        passages of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">H1975 cells</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T790M</TIMEX> mutation would be informative in this regard.
        Recently, new small-molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> have been identified that retain activity
        against the majority of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX> in an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúopen‚Äù</ENAMEX> conformation, as opposed to imatinib, which binds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúclosed‚Äù</ENAMEX> conformation
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,13</NUMEX>]. Analogously, it may be possible to find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> that bind
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase domain in different ways than gefitinib and erlotinib. For example, the
        crystal structure of another EGFR inhibitor, lapatinib (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GW572016</NUMEX>), was recently solved
        bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. This study revealed that the quinazoline rings of erlotinib and
        lapatinib interact differently with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase domain, suggesting that while the T790M
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX> may affect inhibition by erlotinib and gefitinib, it may not affect inhibition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> by compounds similar to lapatinib. To our knowledge, no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NSCLC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who initially
        responded to but then progressed on either gefitinib or erlotinib has yet been treated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lapatinib</ENAMEX>.
        In some of the patient specimens analyzed, the actual sequencing peaks demonstrating the
        T790M mutation were smaller than originally anticipated. These results differ from those of
        acquired resistance mutation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GIST</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,27</NUMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HES</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. However, in contrast
        to all of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, in which tumor cells are readily accessible, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung-cancer</ENAMEX>-related
        tumors are more difficult to access, as illustrated by the limited manner in which we were
        able to obtain tumor cells from various sites of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Moreover,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-biopsy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> is not routinely performed. The use of position
        emission tomography scans to identify the most metabolically active <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> for biopsy
        could possibly circumvent this factor in the future, as long as such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resectable</ENAMEX>. Additionally, as more molecularly tailored treatment options become available
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>, re-biopsy of progressive sites of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should become a standard
        procedure, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on clinical trials of targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        Since tumor specimens from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acquired resistance to EGFR
        tyrosine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kinase inhibitors</ENAMEX> did not demonstrate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation, this specific lesion
        does not account for all mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. Given
        the paradigm established with imatinib, other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>-resistance mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX>, either within or outside the tyrosine kinase domain, are likely to
        exist. It is also possible that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> amplification itself plays a role in acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, since
        imatinib-resistant clones have been shown to lack resistance mutations but contain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amplified</ENAMEX> copies of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR-ABL</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,28</NUMEX>]. Nonetheless, studies presented here provide a basis for
        the rational development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúsecond generation‚Äù kinase inhibitors</ENAMEX> for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX>.
