        transmitted by its rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, is endemic in certain areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX>, where several
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are estimated to be infected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. The disease is asymptomatic
        or mild in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80%</NUMEX> of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> have severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multisystem disease</ENAMEX>. Estimated overall mortality is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>%â<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">€“2%</NUMEX>.
        Death rates are particularly high for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> trimester of pregnancy, and for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fetuses</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95%</NUMEX> of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>. The most common
        complication of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lassa fever</ENAMEX> is deafness. Various degrees of deafness occur in approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of cases, and in many cases hearing loss is permanent. Disease severity does not
        seem to affect this complication: deafness may develop in mild as well as in severe
        cases.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lassa fever</ENAMEX> remains a serious challenge to public health in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX>, threatening
        both local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> in rural areas and those who serve them, particularly medical care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>. Ribavirin, an antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, has been used successfully in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lassa</ENAMEX> fever
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but it needs to be given early and is not readily available in the infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. Given the ecology of the rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and conditions in the endemic area, a vaccine
        is mandatory for control. Lassa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> initiatives have suffered from a lack of funding in
        the past, but bioterrorism and recent importation of the disease to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> have brought new resources to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lassa</ENAMEX> virus science.
        Early attempts to develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Lassa fever</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> focused on killed
        pathogens, which caused a strong humoral response but failed to protect nonhuman primate
        test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> used vaccinia vectors carrying different
        combinations of structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Lassa proteins</ENAMEX>. Some of these protected <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of nonhuman primates
        from a lethal challenge in the absence of a strong humoral response, suggesting that
        cellular responses are important for protection.
        Use of vaccinia vectors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is problematic, especially in areas where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection is commonâ€”immune-suppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> can develop serious skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lesionsâ</ENAMEX>€”and
        several alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> based on other vectors as well as harmless vaccinia ones are
        under development. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Geisbert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> now report promising results with a
        replication-competent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> based on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis</ENAMEX> virus
        vectors expressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lassa</ENAMEX> viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glycoprotein</ENAMEX>. A single intramuscular vaccination
        protected all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> vaccinated cynomolgus macaques against a lethal challenge of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particular Lassa</ENAMEX> strain, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> control monkeys that had received empty vector died
        after injection with the same dose of virus.
        These are encouraging results, but future larger studies will need to assess the
        duration of protection and demonstrate the safety of this replication-competent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>.
        Another crucial question is how quickly vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> acquire protection, and thus
        whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> would be suitable for creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> of vaccination around an outbreak
        zone, the most likely early application of a promising candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. In addition,
        there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> different strains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lassa</ENAMEX> virus, and an ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> should
        provide protection across all strains. Finally, conducting trials in endemic areas, many of
        which lack political stability, remains a serious challenge.
