        the existing business model for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> development leads to high prices and unequal access.
        There is now widespread dissatisfaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prices in both the developed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Families</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA 2003</ENAMEX>) and developing world (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correa 2000).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Governments</ENAMEX> and health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> are finding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> to deny access to the newest and priciest products. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> without a universal public health system, the uninsured simply cannot afford the
        newest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>. In developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, life-saving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> are priced beyond the
        reach of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, a morally offensive outcome (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrueVisionTV 2003).</ENAMEX> Huge publicity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surrounds</ENAMEX> negotiated price reductions for specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in specific developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>,
        yet the effect on the overall access problem is tiny.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prices are a direct consequence of a business model that uses a single
        payment to cover both the cost of manufacture of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and the cost of the research and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX>) carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> to discover it. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> patent-based
        marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopoly</ENAMEX> is then granted to the drug's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> to prevent their prices being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undercut by ‘generic’</ENAMEX> copies produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> who do not have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> costs to
        recover. Preventing such <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‘free riding’</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> has become a global trade issue at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organisation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTO</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drahos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braithwaite 2002).</ENAMEX> The implementation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRIPS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</ENAMEX>) agreement and a growing
        number of regional and bilateral agreements on intellectual property require most countries
        to implement tough patent systems that discourage or eliminate competition from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>).
        Unfortunately, monopoly-based business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have unpleasant side effects. Since the
        primary responsibility of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is to maximise return on investment, it is
        unsurprising that there is pressure on pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to set <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prices to
        whatever level gives the highest return, excluding those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who cannot afford to
        pay, rather than maximising the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated. There is also pressure to
        misuse the power given by patents, using them as anticompetitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> to block
        innovation and extend marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopolies</ENAMEX>. And there are growing fears that the huge
        growth in the use of patents is in itself starting to inhibit research (CIPR <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>;
        Anonymous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Society 2003</ENAMEX>). Something that is less well recognised is that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is an enormously inefficient way of purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">R&D</ENAMEX>. There is a considerable lack
        of transparency in pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R&D</ENAMEX> investment, but the available data indicate that
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> sales go towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> on new products. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only about one-quarter</NUMEX> of
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> approvals are rated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>) to
        have therapeutic benefit over existing treatments (NIHCM <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Measured by
        investment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about one-fifth</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> is invested in innovative products (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love</ENAMEX>
        2003a). There is also very little research for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that primarily afflict the poor
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trouiller et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; WHO <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>).
        Propping up the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for financing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R&D</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>) is the widely held
        belief that the private sector plays a key role in the development of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> and
        that it is necessary to grant patents to incentivise private-sector financing. If this were
        true, it would make sense to tolerate all sorts of bad outcomes, because the fruits of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> eventually benefit everyone. But granting a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> marketing monopoly on a
        patented invention is only one way to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R&D</ENAMEX>, and the shortcomings of the present
        system are increasingly hard to ignore. Suggestions for alternatives are beginning to come
        from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many quarters</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chatani</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGSD</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> and Love <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; Weisbrod
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). In this essay, we present practical proposals to modify trade rules based solely on
        intellectual property so that alternative policy instruments can be used to encourage
        innovation.
      
      
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Trade Framework</ENAMEX>
        Analysis of worldwide drug expenditure shows that spending varies, but is close to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of
        the gross domestic product (GDP) in most developed and developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love 2003b</ENAMEX>).
        Assuming that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a tenth</NUMEX> of the revenue from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is ploughed back into
        R&D on new products, that means that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> already indirectly contribute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.1%</NUMEX>
        GDP to support this. This contribution is enforced by trade agreements, which require the
        granting of patents to prevent ‘free riding’ via the purchase of generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>).
        Suppose the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organisation</ENAMEX> (WHO) developed an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> contribution ‘norm’ based
        upon this or a more appropriate figure and that there was international agreement that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> evaluated as meeting this norm would no longer be regarded as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‘free riding’</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> rules could then be modified to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to meet this norm 
        by any means , not just by the implementation of strict TRIPS
        intellectual property rules, as at present.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX> that met the norm would then be free to decide whether they wanted to follow a
        strictly patent-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> as at present, with high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prices for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>, or
        experiment with new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> based on the creation of separate competitive markets for sales
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R&D</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX> adopting the latter system would remove patents on final
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug compounds</ENAMEX>, placing them in the public domain. This would allow them to become a freely
        traded commodity, creating a competitive manufacture and sales market with low generic
        prices. At the same time, in order to meet the required <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> contribution norm, they
        would have to create an efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> virtual market alongside. However, the costs of
        this would be more than offset by the reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> prices, making substantial savings
        for that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> overall.
      
      
        Business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Models</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Effective Virtual R&D Market</ENAMEX>
        The existing system (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>), despite its failings, does lead to the development of
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The challenge in creating a virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R&D</ENAMEX> market is to find viable business
        models for successful drug development in the absence of marketing monopoly incentives.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obvious approach is direct funding of drug development. For example, the National
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>), the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, already spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">billion</NUMEX> per year on research, a substantial amount of which is directed towards drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, including clinical trials. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> already has a track record in developing
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for severe illnesses, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, showing that this is a viable
        model. It is also widely recognised that much of the research carried out across the world
        by similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> underpins the existing commercial research that leads to new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Governments</ENAMEX> could expand direct funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> development, either through the
        existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in academia or through funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> arms of existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to
        carry out specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">R&D</ENAMEX>. Such directed drug development funding could be similar to
        existing nonprofit development projects, such as those currently resourced to address
        treatments for neglected diseases like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and tuberculosis (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX>). Examples of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicines for Malaria Venture</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mmv</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global Alliance</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TB</ENAMEX>
        Drug Development (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tballiance</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International AIDS Vaccine Initiative</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iavi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neglected Diseases Initiative</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Butler</ENAMEX> 2003b) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dndi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>),
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for One World Health</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oneworldhealth</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>).
        Many are doubtful that increased direct funding would generate sufficient incentives or
        be managed efficiently enough. An alternative market-based approach is one in which R&D
        organisations compete for rewards for specific <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> output, referred to by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> as
        a prize model (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>; Kremer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shavell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Ypersele 2001).</ENAMEX> In a simple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formulation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> would place large sums into a fund that would be allocated every
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that bring new products to market. This could work with or without patents.
        If products were protected by patents or other intellectual property claims, the government
        could grant compulsory licenses (a procedure allowed by trade agreements to override
        monopoly rights on a patent, in return for compensation to rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>; see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>) and
        permit rapid introduction of generic competition. The reward system could be a lump-sum
        payment, eliminating any incentive to continue to market the product, or a long-term payout
        structure, which would depend upon evidence of both usage and efficacy. Prize systems could
        be designed to be fairly similar to the current system, with big payoffs for successful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX>, but even with this approach, there would be huge opportunities to improve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">welfare</ENAMEX>. The reward system could be more rational than the existing system, allocating
        greater rewards for innovative products and less for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‘me too’ products</ENAMEX> that do not work
        better than existing products. Premiums could be given for therapies that address treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> or for inventions that pave the way to new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
        Organisations competing for prizes might be expected to behave secretly to ensure that
        they are the ones to obtain ‘credit’ for the fruits of their work. However, progress in
        research is also driven by free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of information. It may be possible to design
        models that both reward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R&D</ENAMEX> outputs and at the same time encourage complete and
        continuous openness with intermediate research outputs. There are now a number of examples
        of open collaborative public goods <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cukier 2003</ENAMEX>), such as those used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genome Project</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> point to the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNU/Linux</ENAMEX> in the
        software field as evidence that major projects can be undertaken with radically different
        business models. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the benefits of complete openness is that it allows independent and
        open evaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> outputs, which helps in the allocation of ‘credit’ whether in
        the form or prizes or new research grants. The open-access publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 2003</ENAMEX>) has the potential to help in this process by allowing independent analysis of
        published science, which will help research funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> measure research outputs.
      
      
        Competitive Intermediators
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> contribution norm, established by treaty, would ensure that the amount of
        money being spent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> is maintained. However, new mechanisms would be needed to
        collect the money to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX>, as it would no longer come via <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> sales. This
        could be via general taxation, although in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with a private health insurance system
        this may be anathema. Many will also worry that a centralised national drug development
        agency taking decisions on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> priorities and allocation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX> (via prizes or grants
        as discussed above) could easily become bureaucratic and inefficient.
        As a possible alternative, we propose a competitive financing scheme that would work
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R&D</ENAMEX> investment intermediators. These R&D funds would be licensed and
        regulated (like pension funds). Their role would be to manage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> assets on behalf of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>) would be required to make minimum contributions into
        R&D funds, much as there are mandatory contributions to social security or health
        insurance or to pension funds. Government would set the required contribution, but the
        individual (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>) would be free to choose the particular intermediator that received
        their contributions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intermediators</ENAMEX> would compete to attract funds to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R&D</ENAMEX> on
        the basis of their prowess for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> development and upon their priorities. Different
        business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for financing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R&D</ENAMEX> could be tested in such a market, with intermediators
        experimenting with prize systems, direct investments in profit or nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collaborative</ENAMEX> public good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, or other approaches.
      
      
        A Change for the Common Good
        We believe the economics of a change in the paradigm for funding R&D are highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">favourable</ENAMEX>. Taken together, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> core steps of changing the trade framework and moving
        away from marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopolies</ENAMEX> can change the world in a positive way. We can raise global
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> levels as a matter of policy and ensure that resources flow into the areas of the
        greatest need, and we can do so knowing that the poor and the rich will have access to new
        inventions at marginal cost. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Policy-makers</ENAMEX> will be weaned from their current unhealthy
        addiction to ever-higher levels of intellectual property rights as the only instrument to
        raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> levels, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> that has increasingly reached diminishing returns or become
        counterproductive. With new instruments to address the overall levels of R&D
        investment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policy-makers</ENAMEX> can more constructively address the well-known inefficiencies in
        the patent system without the fear that global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> levels will suffer and explore
        alternative models (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Butler</ENAMEX> 2003a). At the same time, the system of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prescribing medicines</ENAMEX>
        will be transformed by a substantial reduction in the distorting influences of the current
        multibillion-dollar industry of marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and (increasingly) directly
        to the public. Similarly, without marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopolies</ENAMEX> to protect, there will be far less
        spent to influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> that set the rules that regulate such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monopolies</ENAMEX>. If
        implemented worldwide, one of our most vexing ethical dilemmas can be resolved in a manner
        that actually promotes the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Doha Declaration on TRIPS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health</ENAMEX> mandate to encourage
        access to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> for all.
