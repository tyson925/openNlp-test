        Antiretroviral therapy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>) has been a milestone in the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection.
        Current treatment guidelines for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> infection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> recommend the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">initiation of ART</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD4 T</ENAMEX> cell counts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 350</NUMEX> cells<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Œºl</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In
        implementing these guidelines, health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> face the ongoing challenge of
        developing treatment strategies that minimize drug-related toxicity and adverse effects
        while retaining effective control of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, treatment-associated
        costs (particularly in resource-poor areas), difficulty in maintaining long-term optimal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], and the emergence of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>] have limited the feasibility
        of life-long ART-mediated viral suppression, increasing the need for alternative treatment
        strategies. Intermittent therapy strategies, consisting of alternating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> on and off
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>, have increasingly emerged as a potential intervention to address limitations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continuous ART</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7,8,9</NUMEX>]. Therapy interruption (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>) studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">suppressed HIV</ENAMEX> infection [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] have addressed the general questions as to whether such
        strategies can achieve greater viral control through increased antiviral responses
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">autoimmunization hypothesis</NUMEX>) or simply serve as a strategy to reduce cost of long-term
        therapy and drug-associated toxicity. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> studies and uncontrolled (or incomplete)
        trials in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection have addressed viral and immune outcomes of
        fixed-length <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and fixed on-drug cycles [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,12,13,14,15,16</NUMEX>], no completed randomized,
        controlled trial has yet addressed by intent-to-treat analysis the outcome during an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">open-ended TI</ENAMEX> of sequential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> versus continuous treatment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with confirmed
        suppression. The largest study to date in this area is the prospective single-arm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Swiss‚ÄìSpanish Intermittent Trial</ENAMEX> (SSITT) conducted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing
        sequential <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-wk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> and showing a lack of impact of this strategy on achieving sustained
        viral loads of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml off therapy in those that completed the study
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. However, the lack of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> in this study has left unanswered questions about
        the impact of multiple TIs on time to rebound, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune reconstitution</ENAMEX>, therapy failure, and
        viral resistance when analyzed against a randomized control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of continuous treatment
        followed for equal time before a single open-ended interruption.
        We completed a randomized, controlled trial on the outcome of repeated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2- to 6-wk</NUMEX> TIs in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic infection in which the comparator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> maintained continuous therapy
        and then an open-ended interruption period was applied in both treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The study
        addressed the potential for repeated interruptions of therapy to delay time to viral
        rebound as a primary outcome and analyzed secondary outcomes regarding study-defined safety
        criteria, viral suppression and resistance, and retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune reconstitution</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between August 2000 and December 2003</TIMEX>, we enrolled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> who
          were older than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 y</NUMEX> and on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>; eligibility criteria included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts of greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> cells<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Œºl</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ART</ENAMEX> with a nadir of no less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> cells/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Œºl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>-mediated suppression
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< 500 copies/ml</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6</NUMEX> mo and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 50</NUMEX> copies/ml at recruitment on any
          antiretroviral regimen. Approval of the study protocol was obtained from the
          institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> (IRB) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Field Initiating Group</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
          Trials (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). Written informed consent was obtained
          from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Human experimentation guidelines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> were followed. The study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, including the patient consent form, the CONSORT form, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> approval, can
          be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protocols S1‚ÄìS4</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Randomization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study Design</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jonathan Lax Immune Disorder Clinic</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, were randomized via sealed envelopes in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1</TIMEX> fashion to a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase (phase I) of either (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> successive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk, respectively,
          or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) maintenance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 wk</TIMEX> before a final interruption of therapy in both arms
          (phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>) subject to therapy reinitiation criteria as described below. Phase II
          consisted of an open-ended interruption to allow for virological and immunological
          comparisons between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> off therapy. Study visits were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every 2 wk</NUMEX> for the repeated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interruptions</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> wk for the continuous ART <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> during phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Both</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were followed every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> wk during phase II. We followed a study design with
          step-wise increases in the length of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> to address potential safety concerns
          (resuppression was confirmed after shorter <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">TIs</TIMEX> before longer interruptions were
          initiated) and the hypothesis that sequential viral replication intervals would stimulate
          viral control and a delay in time to viral rebound.
          Phase I procedures for the repeated interruptions group included the following. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          Interruption of therapy was individually timed to occur after two <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> measurements of
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> copies/ml without any viral load measurements greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> copies/ml in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX>; these interruptions increased from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 4 to 6</TIMEX> wk sequentially. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) If a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-log
          or greater reduction in viral load did not occur by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk of reinitiated therapy or less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> copies/ml was not achieved within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 wk</NUMEX> of reinitiated therapy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          withdrawn as therapy failures and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> test was performed. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were also
          withdrawn as therapy failures if (a) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CD4</TIMEX> cell number declined by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 45%</NUMEX> of the
          baseline <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count, (b) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> developed an opportunistic infection, even if
          retaining required <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count levels, or (c) a viral load of greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX>
          copies/ml occurred once, with or without development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute retroviral syndrome</ENAMEX> as
          defined by fever, skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, and pharyngitis.
          Phase I procedures for the continuous therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> included the following: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) patient
          monitoring if detected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">viremia</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 50</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">999</NUMEX> copies/ml, with the patient
          withdrawn if their viral load did not return to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 50</NUMEX> copies/ml immediately prior
          to phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> study withdrawal as therapy failure if during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-wk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>
          period viral load rebounded to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> copies/ml at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consecutive time
          points.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phase II</ENAMEX> procedures for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> included the following: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) monitoring for patient
          study withdrawal criteria as described in phase I, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) determining time to primary end
          point of a viral load greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) monitoring until the time of
          therapy reinitiation at a viral load greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> copies/ml for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> consecutive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) after reinitiation of therapy, follow-up on therapy to confirm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuppression</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 50</NUMEX> copies/ml at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> wk on therapy. Clinical and
          laboratory parameters (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count and viral load) were monitored at each visit, and venous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was collected for additional secondary outcomes during selected study visits.
          In both phase <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> taking non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nucleoside</NUMEX> reverse-transcriptase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (NNRTIs) were instructed to stop them a day earlier than the remaining drugs
          in the regimen.
        
        
          Primary and Secondary Outcomes
          The primary outcome was time to confirmed virological rebound during phase II. Rebound
          was defined as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time point with greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Viral replication</ENAMEX>
          magnitude as defined by mean HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma RNA</ENAMEX> area under the curve (AUC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> ) was measured as a secondary outcome at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks 12 and 20</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phase II</ENAMEX> based on reinitiation-of-therapy criteria outlined above.
          Additional secondary outcomes included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) safety outcomes (serious adverse events
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAEs</ENAMEX>] and patient withdrawal based on criteria defined above), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) retention of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune reconstitution</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) detection of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retention of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> reconstitution was analyzed by (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) same-day whole blood flow-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cytometry</ENAMEX>-based
          analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD8 T</ENAMEX> cells, including total and na√Øve (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD62 l/CD45RA</ENAMEX>) and memory
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD45RO</NUMEX>) subsets as described [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same-day</TIMEX> recall response analysis of
          peripheral blood mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lymphoproliferative responses to 
          Candida albicans as described [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Viral resistance mutations
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retrospectively</ENAMEX> analyzed on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cryopreserved plasma samples</ENAMEX> by genotyping of first
          available sample with viral load greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> copies/ml following each interruption
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TruGene Assay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visible Genetics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gladstone Institute of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Immunology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) as previously
          described [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,19</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Sample Size
          The sample size required was calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] software, and based on a type I
          error of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> power, to detect a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> wk or more in time to viral
          rebound between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> resulted in sufficient power (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX> for
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) to determine a difference of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> wk or greater between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in time to
          rebound of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> during the open-ended interruption. Assuming a loss to follow-up of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>,
          we targeted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42</NUMEX> total.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          The primary analysis was an intent-to-treat analysis in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> were assigned a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 0</TIMEX> rebound <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> (e.g., maximum failure to delay rebound). In secondary analyses,
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> were excluded. The log-rank test was used to test the null hypothesis of
          no difference between arms in the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> from initiation of the open-ended <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> to
          reaching viral rebound as defined. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> not reaching end point at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">26 wk</TIMEX> after the
          beginning of the open-ended <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> were censored. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank sum tests were used to
          compare baseline and week <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> of the open-ended interruption between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Wilcoxon
          signed rank tests were used to test for no change from baseline to week <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> of phase II.
          Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> rank sum tests were employed to test between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for equality of the
          mean AUC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 12 and 20</TIMEX> wk. In all cases, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided alpha level of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> was used to define statistical significance. Unless otherwise stated, results are
          presented as median (interquartile range) in text and tables.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initiating Group</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV Trials</ENAMEX> were enrolled, randomized, and followed as shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. In the continuous therapy/single interruption <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> reached
          the open-ended interruption. Reasons for study discontinuation in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> were loss to

          No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> discontinuation in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was due to study-defined changes in CD4

          or acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retroviral syndrome</ENAMEX>). However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> non-study-related SAEs occurred: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the continuous therapy/single interruption <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> were hospitalized, one for a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electing</ENAMEX> to stay off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>; and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from the repeated interruptions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> developed a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immune</ENAMEX> reconstitution
          No significant difference was observed between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD4 T</ENAMEX> cell counts at the
          start of phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, as illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In addition, no difference in the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans was observed, confirming the absence of
          significant differences in the retention of baseline immune reconstitution correlates
          between arms. However, a significant decrease in the abundance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> cells relative to
          other T cell types as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD4%</ENAMEX> (but not in absolute <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count ) was present in

          Viral resistance mutations and therapy failure
          An intent-to-treat analysis of the combined number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> with detected
          resistance mutations irrespective of therapy failure in phase I and during the final <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
          in phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> showed no significant difference between arms (continuous therapy/single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>,

          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
          Study-defined criteria for therapy failure of a previously suppressive regimen were

          S47, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S52</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S59</ENAMEX>) in association with self-reported nonadherence to therapy and
          detection of resistance mutations in phase I, as listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in the
          repeated interruptions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/21</NUMEX>; patient S56) failed therapy after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> wk following the

          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who reached phase <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> in the absence of therapy failure, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were identified to have resistance mutations at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first viremic time</TIMEX> point

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>). A greater number of resistance mutations was detected in the
          repeated interruption <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, as summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> out of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, a
          change in resistance patterns was observed when comparing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first viremic time</TIMEX> point to
          the last. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> who reinitiated therapy retained suppressive
          ability of their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regimens</ENAMEX>, as did all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not show
          resistance mutations in phase II. In the repeated interruptions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, analysis of newly
          detected resistance mutations in phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, as defined by a lack of detection during

          this pattern (see notations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Earlier reports on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> strategies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection include multiple
        pilot or single-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> study designs centered on the effects on viral control by comparison
        with pre-therapy periods, detection of resistance mutations without parallel follow-up of a
        continuously treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, and inclusion of variable criteria regarding viral resuppression
        before proceeding with repeated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,12,14,16</NUMEX>]. In contrast, our strategy mandated
        resuppression of viral replication to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 50</NUMEX> copies/ml before each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and presents
        the first comparison of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> during a final open-ended interruption of therapy
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomized to complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sequential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> or stay under continuous
        therapy. Our data, based on intent-to-treat analysis, did not show that repeated TIs
        resulted in a clinically significant virological benefit as measured by the time to viral
        rebound to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Secondary as-treated analysis on viral
        replication magnitude also indicated a lack of difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. Consistent with the
        findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSITT</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], analysis of our data by the categorical classification of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúresponder‚Äù</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with viral load <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 12</TIMEX> off therapy
        showed no significant difference in this frequency between arms (single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5/18</NUMEX>; repeated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5/16</NUMEX>), suggesting the presence of ‚Äúresponders‚Äù irrespective of previous
        protocol-mandated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX>.
        Based on secondary outcome measures, the incidence of adverse events (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAEs</ENAMEX>, therapy
        failure, and patient discontinuation) or clinical disease progression (as indicated by CD4
        count on therapy or opportunistic infections) was not observed to be different between
        arms. Prospective safety outcomes in our study are in accordance with reports from a
        retrospective analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,290</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who interrupted treatment at least once (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">< 3</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mo</ENAMEX>) without an increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> or mortality (with the exception
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> stage C during first interruption
        only) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. In regards to immunological outcomes, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> associated with interruption of
        suppressive therapy is the potential for irreversible, viral-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD4 T</ENAMEX> cell loss
        leading to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,22</NUMEX>]. We did not observe a decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> cell numbers or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphoproliferative</ENAMEX> responses against 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> albicans when measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> before the open-ended <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
        (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), nor following resuppression after monitored <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">reinitiation cycles</ENAMEX> in the
        repeated interruptions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The latter is consistent with observations by
        others and does not support an immediate immunological ‚Äúcost‚Äù to short-term TIs
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,14,15,16,23</NUMEX>]. However, we do show that monitoring CD4 cell numbers by percentage could
        lead to misinterpreting a significant loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> cells as a result of a significant
        increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX> count following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX>, even though absolute <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count numbers remained
        unchanged (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Interestingly, the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD8 T</ENAMEX> cell number also
        corresponded with an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific responses as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon-gamma</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (data not shown), which in light of an absence of effect on viral load between
        arms further supports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> strategies alone may not significantly alter the pre-existing
        balance between viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> and host antiviral responses [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14,16,23,24</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, no evidence for an increase of viral resistance in association with therapy
        failure was present in the repeated interruptions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). We did not observe a
        greater clinical failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NNRTI</ENAMEX>-based regimens in the repeated interruption arm due to
        ‚Äúsingle drug‚Äù periods as predicted by recently redefined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> half-life estimates and the
        presence of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> during each interruption [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,26,27</NUMEX>]. However, the percentage
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with resistance mutations detected in this study in the repeated interruption
        arm (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>) is higher than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSITT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        prior treatment failures were excluded [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. We interpret this difference to mean that the
        resistance detected off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in both our and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> is likely associated with the
        greater number of drug-experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in our cohort (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>) and the detection of prior
        archived resistance mutations as supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metzner et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>], who documented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14/25</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSITT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the presence of minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of M184V occurring at least once off
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> during interruption of therapy.
        In spite of the lack of difference in the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with resistant
        mutations detected on therapy during phase I and off therapy in phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/21</NUMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>] versus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10/21</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47%</NUMEX>], respectively) in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, we do report in similarity to others a greater
        detection of resistance mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> when restricting analysis to the last
        off-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> period only [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,30</NUMEX>] as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>) had mutations detected off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in the
        continuous therapy/single interruption arm compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>) in the repeated
        interruption <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. However, based on the lack of association between viral resistance
        detected off-drug shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and resuppression by the same regimen in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        it remains undetermined to what extent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> favor the detection of archived mutations in
        chronically suppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and to what extent these mutations are a signal for a
        future therapy failure. The latter is best exemplified by the data we collected on patients
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NNRTI</ENAMEX>-based regimens in the repeated interruptions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S19 and S43</TIMEX>)
        showed K103N <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only</NUMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">off-</ENAMEX>drug periods) in the absence of therapy failure
        while maintaining the same regimen after each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>, including post-study follow-up (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        S1). On the other hand, virological failure in the continued presence of an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NNRTI</ENAMEX>-based
        regimen in phase I was associated with detection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">K103N</TIMEX>, as observed in one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S56</NUMEX>)
        in the repeated interruption <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S37</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S52</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S59</ENAMEX>) in the continuous
        therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> with self-reported non-adherence.
        Drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> that occurs during virological drug failure predicts virological
        responses to salvage treatment [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,32,33</NUMEX>]. In contrast, the clinical implications of drug
        resistance mutations that appear shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> in chronically suppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        not clear. Case reports in this cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have demonstrated that drug-resistant
        variants that appeared during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> may not persist in subsequent time points even after
        repeated use of the same antiretroviral regimen [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,34</NUMEX>]. We now observe that drug
        resistance appearing during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> can be transient since <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50% and 33%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> listed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> showed complete and partial reversion to wild type, respectively, when comparing to
        resistance at the last available viremic time point in phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Further, we
        observed durable resuppression of plasma viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> level in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had
        drug-resistance mutations off therapy that would otherwise be expected to affect part of
        their treatment regimen when reinitiated (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table S1</ENAMEX>). Virus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that expand
        shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> may lack all of the adaptations required to achieve high levels of plasma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viremia</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> during continuous treatment. These adaptations may include
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>-associated mutations, which were detected, as well as secondary mutations
        that may increase the viral replication capacity [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,36</NUMEX>] or envelope adaptations required
        to escape concurrent humoral immune responses [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,38</NUMEX>]. It is of interest to note that
        despite the large amount of research activity on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with suppressed chronic
        infection and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of monitored interruptions studied to date, only limited cases
        of development of clinical resistance (as evidenced by a lack of viral resuppression
        following therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reinitiation</ENAMEX>) have emerged, in contrast to the multiple reports of
        detection of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> off ART associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> as shown in this study and
        others [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,19,29,30,39,40</NUMEX>].
        Taken together, while our data show no clinically significant benefit for repeated TIs
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1.5</NUMEX> mo in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> on therapy with regard to
        viral control as defined by time to rebound, secondary outcomes document no significant
        difference in levels of retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune reconstitution</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and no increased
        incidence of virological failure as a consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIs</ENAMEX>. While our data indicate that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> strategy should not be pursued outside of a clinical trial setting, we argue that it
        will be important to collect additional data on the potential benefits of drug-sparing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regimens</ENAMEX> (such as reduced long-term toxicity and reduced cost) and to define long-term
        outcomes in comparison with continuous therapy.
