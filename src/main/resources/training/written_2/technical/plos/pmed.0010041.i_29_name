        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to grasp at thin rays of hope. But seldom has a single anecdotal case
        stimulated as much hope as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> report of an acutely infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who appeared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control HIV</ENAMEX> replication after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> short treatment interruptions [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. This report generated
        the hypothesis that early antiretroviral treatment (during or very soon after symptomatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seroconversion</ENAMEX>) allows the incompletely damaged immune system to recover and respond
        appropriately to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus antigens</ENAMEX> during treatment interruptions. This, in turn, according to
        the hypothesis, leads to control of viral replication by a healed and appropriately
        stimulated immune response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection.
        Consistent with this hypothesis was the prior finding that early antiretroviral therapy
        led to induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific proliferative responses similar to those that had been
        observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with long-term, non-progressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. This led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenberg</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> to ask whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific proliferative responses were a necessary and
        sufficient cause of long-term non-progression or just an immunologic consequence of
        controlled virus replication. Their report of virologic control in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who interrupted
        therapy after early treatment raised hope that if <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection was treated early enough,
        the immune system could be repaired sufficiently to allow for long-term immunologic control
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enthusiasm Fades</ENAMEX>
        A series of discoveries from clinical trials began to chip away at the enthusiasm for
        both early treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection and supervised treatment interruptions (STIs) as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to boost the immune response.
        Several small trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX> in chronically infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were carried out [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>],
        buoyed by the reasonable desire of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for respite from the unpleasant side effects of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. These trials gave disappointing results, up to and including the emergence of
        antiretroviral drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> randomized to receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific immune
        responses did increase off therapy, but so did viral loads. The so-called immune boosting
        probably reflected an immune response to greater viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> load but did not represent
        constructive immune enhancement.
        Larger trials clearly showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX> were of little if any benefit in chronic
        infection and that when therapy was stopped, viral loads invariably returned to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pre-treatment</ENAMEX> levels [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Other studies indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific CD4+ T cells were being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preferentially</ENAMEX> infected, often massively, during treatment interruptions [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], and that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proliferative</ENAMEX> responses were more likely to be a consequence—rather than a cause—of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">decreased HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Despite multiple attempts, early reports of an inverse
        correlation between simple <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific T cell responses and virologic control were not
        confirmed [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Where complex T cell functions did show such a correlation, the data
        indicated that viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> was adversely affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the T cell immune
        response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, and not the other way around [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Thus, no evidence of “immune boosting”
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX> and subsequent viral control in the absence of antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> was ever
        established. Finally, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acutely</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenberg</ENAMEX>'s cohort became
        superinfected with a second strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> despite excellent control of viral replication
        and significant recognition of the superinfecting strain by the pre-existing T cell
        response [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
      
      
        New Findings
        Now comes a study in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> that found that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were treated early and
        who had controlled viral loads for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 90 days</TIMEX>, the virologic control was only
        transient [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. While one could look at this as a glass <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> full—these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> achieved a
        reasonable period of time off antiretroviral therapy—closer scrutiny of the data limits
        this view.
        There was a disconnect between the low viral loads and an unexpectedly high rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell decline in several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. While the small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the single-arm
        nature of the study preclude definitive comparisons, it is possible that the early
        treatment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX> did not result in a delay in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell decline (and, therefore,
        initiation of antiretroviral therapy) beyond what would have occurred had the patients
        received no early treatment.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Implications of the Study</ENAMEX>
        This study raises important questions in our understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV pathogenesis</ENAMEX>,
        treatment, and vaccine development.
        First, why is it that early antiretroviral treatment, even if it does lead to better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX>, does not protect against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell depletion? It is
        possible that by the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> present with acute retroviral syndrome their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell
        reserves (in gut and lymphoid tissues) have been severely depleted, despite the fairly
        normal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ profile of their peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. Thus, even low-level viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> is
        then sufficient to deplete the remaining central and peripheral reserves [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, how do these findings affect treatment guidelines during acute infection? None
        of the current treatment guidelines in either resource-rich or resource-poor settings
        recommend early antiretroviral therapy. In the light of these new data [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], there does not
        appear to be a rationale for early antiretroviral therapy in the absence of a clinical
        trial to assess other interventions in concert with early therapy. The use of therapeutic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX> is an obvious intervention that still needs to be tested, despite limited
        efficacy results in treated chronic infection. As such, practice guidelines should continue
        to caution against early treatment unless associated with a randomized clinical trial.
        Finally, is this good or bad news for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> development? Since most current
        vaccine strategies are based upon the hypothesis that induction of T cell immunity will
        lead to control of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX>, it is difficult to be optimistic when a strong and
        broad immune response is unable to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression. However, one must recall
        that phenotypic and functional assessments of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific T cell responses, even in
        antiretroviral-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, show that these responses clearly differ from responses
        against viruses that are normally cleared or controlled by the immune system [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Therefore, the T cell responses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated for acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection in Kaufmann
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.'s</ENAMEX> study were induced upon a dramatically altered immune background. It remains to be
        determined how much this adversely affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific immune response, and whether an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response generated by vaccination 
        before any <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV replication</ENAMEX> (a prophylactic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>) might be better able
        to control virus replication. Far be it for us to stop grasping at rays of hope.
