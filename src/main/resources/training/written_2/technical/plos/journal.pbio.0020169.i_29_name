        between the inside (intracellular area) and outside (extracellular area) of the cell it
        defines. In order for the cell to sense and respond to its environment (including other
        cells and the supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that comprise the extracellular matrix [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>]) and for
        the environment to influence cell function (including cell growth and movement),
        bidirectional signaling across the plasma membrane has to be mediated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About two decades ago</TIMEX>, it became widely appreciated that many of the cell
        surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that mediate cell‚Äìcell and cell‚ÄìECM interactions were structurally and
        functionally related, and the term ‚Äúintegrins‚Äù was coined to reflect the capacity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to integrate the extracellular and intracellular environment (Hynes
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>). Integrin-mediated interactions are vital to the maintenance of normal cell
        functioning because of their ability to mediate inside-out (intracellular to extracellular)
        and outside-in (extracellular to intracellular) signaling. Integrin dysfunctions are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with numerous human disorders such as thrombosis, atherosclerosis, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, and
        chronic inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. Despite a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 30,000</NUMEX> integrin-related articles
        in the literature, intensive effort‚Äîmore than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> articles per month‚Äîcontinues to focus on
        understanding the roles of integrins in both physiological and pathological processes.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrin Family</ENAMEX>
        The integrin family comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that are found in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>,
        ranging from sponges to mammals (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hynes 2002).</ENAMEX> They consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct, associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> (noncovalent heterodimers), where each subunit (Œ±, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ≤</NUMEX>) consists of a single
        transmembrane domain, a large extracellular domain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (composed
        of multiple structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domains</ENAMEX>), and typically, a small cytoplasmic domain of somewhere
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20‚Äì70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The extracellular domains bind a wide variety of
        ligands, whereas the intracellular cytoplasmic domains anchor to cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In
        this manner, the exterior and interior of a cell are physically linked, which allows for
        bidirectional transmission of mechanical and biochemical signals across the plasma
        membrane, and leads to a cooperative regulation of cell functions, including adhesion,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>, growth, and differentiation. A central topic in the integrin research over the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past decade</TIMEX> has been the mechanism of inside-out activation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liddington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginsberg 2002).</ENAMEX>
        In their resting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, integrins normally bind the molecules that activate them with low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX>. Upon stimulation, a cellular signal induces a conformational change in the
        integrin cytoplasmic domain that propagates to the extracellular domain. Integrins are
        transformed from a low- to a highaffinity ligand binding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Such inside-out regulation
        of integrin affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is distinct from the outside-in signaling observed upon
        activation of most other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transmembrane receptors</ENAMEX> (e.g., growth factor‚Äìgrowth factor
        receptor interactions), including integrins. The inside-out signaling protects the host
        from excessive integrin-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell adhesion</ENAMEX>, which could, for example, lead to
        spontaneous aggregation of blood cells and have profound pathological consequences.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Heads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tails of Inside-Out Signaling</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutational</ENAMEX> studies provided the initial hints that disruption of the non-covalent clasp
        between Œ± and Œ≤ cytoplasmic tails is clearly the event within the structure of the integrin
        that initiates inside-out signaling. Point mutations in the Œ± and Œ≤ cytoplasmic tails that
        are near the membrane or deletion of either region result in constitutive activation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Toole et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991, 1994</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>). Mutating a single specific
        residue in the cytoplasmic tail of either subunit led to integrin activation, but a double
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, which would have allowed retention of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> bridge between the subunits, did not
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes et</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">al. 1996)‚Äîsuggesting</ENAMEX> that integrin inside-out activation is dependent upon
        regulation of the interaction between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits. In support of this hypothesis,
        peptides corresponding to Œ± and Œ≤ cytoplasmic tails have been shown to interact with each
        other (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plow 1996).</ENAMEX> Since these original observations, there has been an intensive
        effort to understand the mechanism for regulation of integrin activation by the cytoplasmic
        region (for a recent review, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hynes 2002).</ENAMEX> On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> toward this goal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginsberg</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> discovered that the head domain of a cytoskeletal protein‚Äîtalin‚Äîplays a key role
        in binding to integrin Œ≤ cytoplasmic tails and inducing integrin activation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calderwood et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 1999</ENAMEX>). Many other intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> bind to the Œ± and Œ≤ cytoplasmic tails (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liu et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 2000</ENAMEX>), but the importance of talin in integrin activation is particularly convincing
        since it has been confirmed by multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinogradova et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> et al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tremuth et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) using various methods including overexpression and gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knockdown</ENAMEX> (siRNA) approaches (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tadokoro et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springer</ENAMEX> and coworkers
        provided evidence for a model by which separation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal portions of the Œ± and Œ≤
        subunits results in inside-out activation. They showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of the
        cytoplasmic-transmembrane regions by an artificial linkage between the tails inactivates
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, whereas breakage of the clasp activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takagi</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2001</ENAMEX>). Shortly thereafter, the model gained direct and strong experimental support
        from a structural analysis in which the membrane-proximal helices of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunits</ENAMEX> were
        found to clasp in a weak ‚Äúhandshake‚Äù that could be disrupted by talin or constitutively
        activating mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinogradova et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has been further verified by
        other biophysical studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim et al. 2003) and</ENAMEX> extended to other integrins (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinogradova et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 2004</ENAMEX>). Since the membrane-proximal regions of integrin Œ± and Œ≤ cytoplasmic tails are
        highly conserved, the generalization of this signaling mechanism to all integrins was to be
        anticipated. A dynamic image of how such cytoplasmic unclasping occurs at the membrane
        surface can now be modeled (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinogradova et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
      
      
        Straightening Out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outside</ENAMEX>
        On the extracellular side, ground-breaking insights were provided when the crystal
        structure of the extracellular domain of integrin Œ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v</ENAMEX> Œ≤
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (the nomenclature identifies the particular Œ± and Œ≤ subunits) was
        determined (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xiong et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). In addition to the exquisite structural details, the
        overall conformation was surprisingly bent (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), which contrasted with structures
        revealed by the earlier electron micrographic studies that showed an extended, stalk-like
        structure (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weisel et al. 1992).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springer</ENAMEX> and coworkers used a series of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">biochemical/biophysical</ENAMEX> experiments to suggest that the bent structure represents an
        inactive form of integrin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takagi et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), whereas activation induces a switchblade
        shift that converts the bent form to the extended form (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A molecular picture has
        emerged for integrin insideout activation where a cellular signal induces the
        conformational change of talin exposing its head domain allowing it to bind to the integrin
        Œ≤ cytoplasmic tail. This interaction unclasps the complex between the cytoplasmic tails,
        which then allows a conformational shift in the extracellular domain from a bent to a more
        extended form for high-affinity ligand binding (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takagi et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
        The activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">integrins</ENAMEX> may then undergo clustering whereby the transmembrane domain of
        each type of subunit (the Œ± or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ≤</NUMEX>) interacts with itself‚Äîcalled homotypic oligomerization of
        the transmembrane domains (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> Ligand occupancy and receptor
        clustering initiates outside-in signaling that, in turn, regulates a variety of cellular
        responses (see below). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> occur as part of a dynamic equilibrium,
        and perturbation of any step can shift the equilibrium, leading to transient, partial, or
        permanent integrin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">activation</ENAMEX>/inactivation depending on the extent of perturbation. For
        example, deletion of aIIb cytoplasmic tail completely removes the clasp and permanently
        activates the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Toole et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>), whereas a particular disease mutation may
        only impair the clasp and partially activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peyruchaud et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). While
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> is based on direct structural evidence for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> face
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vinogradova et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim et al. 2003)</ENAMEX> and the extracellular domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takagi et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), the changes in the transmembrane region remained speculative. In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Luo et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) provide what is, to our knowledge, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first</ENAMEX> experimental evidence for the transmembrane domain separation, an event suggested by
        the model shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. By selectively altering the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that can interact with
        one another, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> defined a specific transmembrane domain interface in resting Œ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> Œ≤
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and showed that this interface is lost upon activation of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrin</ENAMEX>. Backed by extensive structural and biochemical data on the integrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cytoplasmic/extracellular</ENAMEX> domains, this transmembrane domain study takes the next vital
        step toward a more complete understanding of the unclasping mechanism for integrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Although the energy required for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> separation of the transmembrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> in membrane appears to be high, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> step in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (clustering via
        transmembrane domain oligomerization) may compensate for it.
      
      
        Filling in the Pieces
        Despite the molecular level of our understanding of integrin activation, a number of key
        questions remain unresolved. Although we know that the membrane-proximal clasp on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> face controls the integrin activation, the distal side of either the Œ±
        or Œ≤ cytoplasmic tails may also play a role in integrin activation, since other mutations
        indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal membrane distal region is important in regulating integrin
        activation via a mechanism that is yet unknown. Thus, the picture for the cytoplasmic
        face-controlled inside-out activation may be substantially more complicated than specified
        in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. There may exist other factors, such as negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, in cells that bind
        to the cytoplasmic tails or their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and control the conformational change required
        for integrin activation. Also, there may be pathways other than the talin-mediated one that
        lead to integrin activation. Structures of the integrin cytoplasmic face bound to talin and
        the many other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of integrins will
        undoubtedly provide further insights. In the transmembrane region, although there is ample
        evidence for heterodimeric transmembrane domain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yeager</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schneider</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Engelman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottschalk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kessler</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luo et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) and dissociation
        upon integrin activation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luo et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), a definitive structural view is missing. Some
        studies have proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo-oligomerization</ENAMEX> is essential for inducing integrin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> However, the data provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luo et</ENAMEX> al. do not appear to
        support this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. On the extracellular side, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal unclasping and
        separation of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions appears to relieve the structural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constraint</ENAMEX> and may allow the unbending of the extracellular domain to attain the
        high-affinity ligand binding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takagi et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), a thorough molecular understanding
        of this process awaits high resolution structures of the intact <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in inactive and
        active forms.
      
      
        What About Outside-In?
        Upon the inside-out activation, integrins bind to specific extracellular matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However, for the integrins to grip tightly to the extracellular matrix to mediate
        cell adhesion and migration, the integrin cytoplasmic domains must be anchored to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoskeleton</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giancotti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruoslahti 1999).</ENAMEX> This is achieved by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúoutside-in‚</NUMEX>Äù signaling,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, when an integrin binds to the extracellular ligand, it clusters with other bound
        integrins, resulting in the formation of highly organized intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> known as
        focal adhesions that are connected to the cytoskeleton. The focal adhesions incorporate a
        variety of molecules, including the cytoplasmic domains of the clustered integrins,
        cytoskeletal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and an extensive array of signaling molecules. The high local
        concentrations of these molecules facilitate cascades of downstream intracellular responses
        via protein‚Äìprotein interactions, which are linked to the cytoskeleton as well as to
        complex intracellular signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. Although many intracellular components involved
        in outsidein signaling have been identified, and much has been learned about various
        signaling pathways involved in outside-in signaling (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giancotti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ruoslahti 1999</ENAMEX>), a
        molecular view of how the various events occur in time and space is still very uncertain.
        In particular, little structural insight has been obtained for early outside-in
        intracellular events following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM‚</ENAMEX>Äìintegrin binding, e.g., upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> engagement. How is the
        integrin cytoplasmic domain connected to the cytoskeleton? How is this connection regulated
        during cell adhesion and migration? The next wave of structural information may provide
        insights into these important and fertile areas of investigation.
