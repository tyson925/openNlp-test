        A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white male</ENAMEX> with no significant past medical history is referred by his
        workplace to a primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> for an elevated blood pressure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX>). He presents to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> with no complaints. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> both have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>. He has had a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-pound</NUMEX> (lb) weight gain over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</TIMEX> and has
        become more sedentary.
        His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142/90</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, pulse is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> beats per minute (bpm), weight is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209</NUMEX> lb, and height
        is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5′ 11″</NUMEX>. On examination he displays moderate central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX>, but otherwise the
        examination is normal. His fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">228 mg/dl</ENAMEX> (to convert milligrams per
        deciliter of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> [total, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>] to micromoles per liter, divide by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>),
        low-density <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (LDL) is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">166 mg/dl</ENAMEX>, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triglycerides</ENAMEX> (TG) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">223</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl (to convert mg/dl of triglycerides to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mmol</ENAMEX>/l, divide by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>), and fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">114 mg/dl</ENAMEX> (to convert mg/dl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mmol</ENAMEX>/l, divide by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>).
        
          What Is the diagnosis?
          This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> as defined by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III</ENAMEX> guidelines [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Any
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more of the criteria make this diagnosis (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Intensive lifestyle
          modifications such as exercise and weight loss should be made to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>,
          blood pressure, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> (CVD) risk factors [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. It may be timely
          to address the prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> since these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are at high risk for development of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Lifestyle changes delay the
          onset or prevent the incidence of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose intolerance</ENAMEX>, a
          key feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is started on an exercise and weight
          loss program, sent for nutritional counseling, and scheduled for a return clinic
          appointment for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months later</TIMEX>.
        
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two Years</TIMEX> Later
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> returns to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>. He presents with complaints of
          increasing frequency of urination and episodes of blurry vision. He has nocturia and has
          lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> lb in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week</TIMEX>. Otherwise, his review of systems is unremarkable. His blood
          pressure is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146/88</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, pulse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> bpm, and weight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</NUMEX> lb. His fundoscopic examination is
          normal. He continues to have moderate central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obesity</ENAMEX>. Current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> are a thiazide
          diuretic, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> mg once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> (QD), started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> prior. A non-fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood sugar</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">267 mg/dl.</ENAMEX>
          
            Can a diagnosis be made?
            There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> criteria for the diagnosis of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> as defined by the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Diabetes Association</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADA</ENAMEX>), of which any one is sufficient to make the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagnosis</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). This patient meets the criteria for type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. He does not
            need to have a fasting blood sugar done because a random glucose greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl
            with symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> meets the first criterion. Failing to comply with lifestyle
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modification</ENAMEX>, his weight has increased <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 lb</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> and likely contributes to his
            development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Of note, his recent weight loss is presumably due to overt
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperglycemia</ENAMEX> and glycosuria, further underestimating his true weight increase.
            His additional investigations are as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fasting glucose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">215 mg/dl</ENAMEX>; hemoglobin
            A1c (HbA
            1c ), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.6%</NUMEX>; and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mmol
            (normal is <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mmol in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><3.5</NUMEX> mg/mmol in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">176 mg/dl, HDL</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl, and TG <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">292 mg/dl.</ENAMEX> His electrocardiogram is normal.
          
        
        
          What are the next steps in management at this time?
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> should involve a multifaceted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goal-</ENAMEX>directed approach, which
          includes dietary modifications, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> education, assessment of blood sugar readings,
          and pharmacotherapy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADA</ENAMEX> recommends glycemic and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> risk factor goals (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>), in addition to foot evaluation and screening for nephropathy and retinopathy,
          for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is started on metformin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mg twice daily
          (BID) with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX>. Therapy with metformin appears to decrease the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>-related
          endpoints, including a reduction in cardiovascular events independent of glycemic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. There is also less weight gain and fewer hypoglycemic attacks than with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          and sulphonylureas. Therefore, metformin may be an effective <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line pharmacotherapy
          of choice in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. There are several oral hypoglycemic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (i.e.,
          sulfonylureas, metformin, acarbose, and thiazolidinediones) that are effective
          monotherapy for reducing hyperglycemia.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is also started on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">low-dose aspirin</ENAMEX>, indicated for primary prevention of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">macrovascular disease</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> who have any risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and
          a cholesterol-lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX>, a statin, for his increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. He is
          given a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">glucose meter</NUMEX>, is scheduled to have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> education classes and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> counseling for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,800-calorie</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADA diet</ENAMEX>, and is instructed to record his
          pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal blood sugars</ENAMEX>. Smoking cessation is another important aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to address. He returns in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> for follow-up and has an <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HbA1c</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3%</NUMEX>,
          at which time no additional therapy is started.
        
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three Years</TIMEX> Later
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years old</TIMEX> and returns for a follow-up appointment. He states
          that he has felt “pins and needles” in his feet and fingertips. He has had difficulty
          with maintaining erections but has a normal libido. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood sugars</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160–190</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mornings</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200–240</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl in the evenings, and the patient reports no hypoglycemic
          events. He has diminished sensation to vibration over his right great toe and left toes
          and heel with intact monofilament sensation. The remainder of his examination is
          unchanged. His <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> are metformin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> g BID, a thiazide diuretic at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 mg QD</TIMEX>, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statin QD</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin QD</ENAMEX>. He is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">215</NUMEX> lb, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142/86</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, and pulse is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> bpm.
          Recent laboratory tests produced the following results: a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">HbA1c</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.1%</NUMEX>, a fasting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glucose</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">212 mg/dl</ENAMEX>, and normal electrolytes, creatinine, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver enzymes</ENAMEX>. Fasting
          lipids are LDL <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">144 mg/dl, HDL 33 mg/dl</ENAMEX>, and TG <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">209 mg/dl.</ENAMEX>
          
            What additional diagnostic tests would be helpful at this time, and why?
            A spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mmol. This measurement technique
            is preferred because it has lower rates of false-positive and false-negative results
            than a spot urine microalbumin. Persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microalbuminuria</ENAMEX> should be confirmed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            or three subsequent readings within a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-month period</TIMEX> to rule out false-positive
            results. The elevated ratio of microalbumin in the urine signifies early nephropathy
            because microalbuminuria has been shown to progress to macroalbuminuria and eventual
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nephropathy</ENAMEX> in type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Any degree of albuminuria is a risk factor
            for cardiovascular events in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>; the risk increases
            with the level of absolute microalbuminuria [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Therefore, screening for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microalbuminuria</ENAMEX> should be done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and type 2 diabetes
            [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetic retinopathy</ENAMEX> should be performed in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> after an initial evaluation and reassessed more frequently if retinopathy is
            diagnosed. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> remains free of retinopathy, but a significant number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> have retinopathy at the onset of diagnosis owing to the
            insidious nature of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and the failure to diagnose type 2 diabetes early.
            Tight glycemic control can slow the progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic retinopathy</ENAMEX> (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1–3</NUMEX>)
            [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and help prevent development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proliferative diabetic retinopathy</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            What additional pharmacotherapy should be started at this time?
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has developed neuropathy and erectile dysfunction, both of which are
            complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. He continues to have suboptimal glycemic control; therefore,
            additional therapy in the form of combinations is appropriate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is started
            on a thiazolidinedione (TZD) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QD</ENAMEX>. With continued elevated systolic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP ></ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">130</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hg</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic BP</ENAMEX> ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX>-I) is
            started. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACE-I</ENAMEX> at this time is appropriate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> control and has the additional
            preventative effects of reducing progression to nephropathy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> events [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11</NUMEX>]. In
            addition, continued strict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> control is as effective as tight glycemic control in
            preventing macrovasular disease in diabetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and slowing the progression of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> nephropathy and retinopathy [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Erectile dysfunction is a complication
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and can be an early sign of neuropathy and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular disease</ENAMEX>,
            therefore a phosphodiesterase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> enzyme inhibitor is an appropriate choice for patients
            not on vasodilators or with a history of significant CVD. The statin dose is increased
            to achieve a goal LDL of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≤100 mg/dl.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetic</ENAMEX> neuropathy is a significant cause of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity in diabetes</ENAMEX>, and its progression correlates directly with glycemic control.
            Tighter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> control and proper foot care are effective. It is important to continue
            emphasis on dietary, exercise, and lifestyle modifications in addition to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacotherapy</ENAMEX>.
          
        
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five Years</TIMEX> Later
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> returns to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> after spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three years</TIMEX> overseas and
          has not seen a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>. He complains of fatigue, occasional blurry vision,
          awakening <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> to urinate, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> at least once a week. He
          says that he has been compliant with his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> but has gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> lb in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last six months</TIMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> include metformin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> g BID, a TZD BID, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ACE-I</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QD</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood sugar</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">289 mg/dl</ENAMEX> (fasting), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130/90</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, pulse is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> bpm, and
          weight is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">221</NUMEX> lb. There are no foot sores or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ulcers</ENAMEX>, but he has diminished sensation to
          monofilament on the plantar surfaces of both feet. The remainder of his examination is
          unchanged, including normal fundoscopy. His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HbA1c</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.6%</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">143 mg/dl</ENAMEX>, and spot
          urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/mmol. His creatinine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver enzymes</ENAMEX> are
          normal. His pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal blood sugars</ENAMEX> average <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">210–250 mg/dl.</ENAMEX>
          
            What is the next most appropriate step in his medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>?
            He continues to have an elevated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HbA1c</TIMEX>, worsening neuropathy, and weight gain, which
            prompt a more effective treatment strategy. There are several options for
            pharmacotherapy available to choose from at this point. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> could begin a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
            oral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> after maximizing the doses of metformin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TZD</ENAMEX>, or he could begin insulin
            injections with or without additional oral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Because of the significant cost
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> oral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> and his need for further glycemic control,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> would be an appropriate choice at this time. However, he should be advised of
            the side effect of additional weight gain when beginning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> therapy.
          
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISCUSSION</ENAMEX>
        This case presentation illustrates an otherwise healthy appearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who is found
        to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> and despite evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> develops type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. This patient likely represents the natural history of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> is often the only presenting sign of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> and
        prediabetes, allowing an opportunity for prevention of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        There is an association between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> and the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> and type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetes</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This syndrome is characterized not only by the criteria given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
        but also by a state of compensatory hyperinsulinemia [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. However, a diagnosis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> alone does not imply <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> can
        have a fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 110</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl. It is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s ability to maintain
        glucose utilization and suppress endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> production in the setting of this
        compensatory hyperinsulinemia that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">separates metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. The effect
        of this hyperinsulinemic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> is also believed to be involved in
        excess pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic markers associated with the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVD</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> when tissues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> fail to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utilize glucose</ENAMEX> appropriately owing to increased resistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and concomitant
        beta-cell dysfunction of the pancreas [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metformin</ENAMEX> is in the class of biguanides and works by decreasing hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> output
        and increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> action in tissues. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metformin</ENAMEX> has been suggested to help prevent the
        onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> but is less effective than diet and lifestyle changes [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Other
        medications shown to possibly delay or prevent the onset of type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACE-I</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">angiotensin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor blockers</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,18</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> treated with diuretics can progress to
        type 2 diabetes even though thiazide diuretics are proven effective in treating
        hypertension [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,20</NUMEX>].
        Intensive therapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 diabetes results in a decreased risk of
        microvascular complications; therefore, it is appropriate to use combinations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with suboptimal glycemia [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TZDs</ENAMEX> works to lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> levels by increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity in muscle and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. TZDs
        lower mean HbA1c modestly when added to metformin as compared to metformin alone [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Side
        effects include weight gain and water retention, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart Association</ENAMEX> class III or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IV heart failure</ENAMEX> should not use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TZDs</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24,25</NUMEX>].
        The pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes involves, in part, a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">“relative” deficiency</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>. Although a state of endogenous hyperinsulinemia occurs, the degree of tissue
        resistance causes a total decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">“effective” endogenous insulin</ENAMEX>. Progression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is also attributed to worsening beta-cell dysfunction and decreased release of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin</ENAMEX> is used in a variety of combinations and is individualized to patient
        lifestyle. A frequent starting dose consists of a long- or intermediate-acting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NPH insulin</ENAMEX>, divided into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning and evening</TIMEX> doses, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin glargine</ENAMEX> given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QD</ENAMEX>,
        usually at bedtime. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> whose case is described here was started on NPH at bedtime,
        which decreases overnight hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> production such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> begins the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> with near-normal glycemia for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> oral therapy. There may be times when a
        post-meal surge in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> requires extra <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> in addition to the intermediate-acting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPH</ENAMEX>. In such a case, using a short-acting (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> before meals provides insulin
        action that closely approximates normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin secretion</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The rapid-acting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lispro</ENAMEX> and aspart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulins</ENAMEX> have an even shorter half-life and quicker onset of action than
        regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>. Common empirical initiation doses range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4–1.2</NUMEX> units of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kilogram per</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> should be advised of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX> and weight gain as the
        main side effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> therapy. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin-sensitizer</ENAMEX> combinations
        significantly improve hyperglycemia; however, there is an increased incidence of heart
        failure reported with this combination, prompting close monitoring of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for signs
        and symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>].
        In summary, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> prevention and management is an important goal in practice. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is a significant burden to health care, emphasizing
        the need for effective prevention and control of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in improving outcomes.
