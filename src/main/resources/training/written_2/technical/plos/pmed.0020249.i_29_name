        Worldwide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 40 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3 million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> died of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> alone [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Unfortunately, numerous obstacles to providing
        effective antiretroviral treatment to the majority of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in resource-poor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> exist. The development of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or other preventive biomedical intervention
        therefore bears the greatest hope to curb the rampant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> epidemic [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        Research on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> and prevention relies strongly on preclinical studies in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macaque</ENAMEX> models for the identification and evaluation of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> or prophylactic
        treatment strategies [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Initially, the goal was to use animal trials to screen for
        preventive interventions that induce sterilizing immunity (i.e., protection against
        infection) since this would clearly be the most effective way to contain the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS pandemic</ENAMEX>.
        Unfortunately, most of the vaccine approaches assessed to date in animal studies have
        failed to induce sterilizing immunity [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4‚Äì7</NUMEX>], although some prophylactic approaches were
        found to reduce susceptibility to infection [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8‚Äì12</NUMEX>]. As a result of this shortcoming,
        vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are at present primarily examined with regard to their effects on set
        point viremia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression, and their general immunogenicity, rather than with
        regard to the degree of protection against infection they confer. However, the inference as
        to the degree of sterilizing immunity from the level of immunogenicity is limited by our
        lack of knowledge about the mechanisms of protection against infection as such [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        The inability of most vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to induce protection against infection in
        animal studies may be due, at least in part, to unintended consequences of the design of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> trials, rather than to problems inherent in the vaccination approaches
        themselves. In most animal studies that seek to test the efficacy of a given preventive
        intervention, very high challenge doses are used, typically of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10‚Äì100</NUMEX> times
        the infectious dose at which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> become infected (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ). The motivation for using such high challenge doses is mostly
        practical: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">experimenter</ENAMEX> wants to ascertain infection success in unvaccinated/untreated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, which can then be compared to the hopefully lower infection success in
        vaccinated/treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. There are, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> with using high challenge doses.
        Firstly, the extremely high probability of infection in high-dose challenge studies
        conflicts with the low transmission rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> per sex act [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14‚Äì17</NUMEX>]. Although it has been
        argued that transmission rates may be higher under some circumstances (such as during acute
        infection or when other infections of the genital tract are present) than the estimates
        obtained from discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> studies suggest (e.g., the recent study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilcher et</ENAMEX> al.
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]), transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> during one sex act surely does not occur with certainty.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">high-dose</ENAMEX> virus challenges may be more difficult to achieve
        because the use of high challenge doses makes stochastic extinctions that can play an
        important role in early control of the infection [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] very unlikely. Thus, standard
        high-dose challenge studies may rule out preventive intervention strategies that could
        protect against infections following ‚Äúreal life‚Äù exposures.
        The problems of using high virus doses in animal studies can be illustrated by the
        discrepancy between the protection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">zidovudine</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AZT</ENAMEX>) confers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Whereas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macaques</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,21</NUMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] were not protected from infection with high challenge doses
        by zidovudine (a relatively weak antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> when used in monotherapy), clinical
        studies surprisingly showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of perinatal infections (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-to-child
        transmissions during birth) can be prevented by zidovudine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. It is
        important to note that the use of zidovudine to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">perinatal HIV</ENAMEX> infection is a
        biomedical intervention aiming to protect from infection, whereas zidovudine is most
        commonly used as a therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> after infection. This example suggests that there is a
        need for experimental designs that allow the assessment of the protection against infection
        with lower, and thus more realistic, challenge doses.
        The belief that experiments involving realistically low challenge doses require
        unfeasibly large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> has prevented the development of low-dose challenge
        models. In this theoretical study, we show that, contrary to this widely held belief,
        low-dose challenge experiments can be designed such that they do not require large numbers
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Using statistical power analysis, we compare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experimental designs (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>): (i) a single low-dose challenge design in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is challenged only
        once, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) a repeated low-dose challenge design in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is challenged
        until it is infected or a predetermined maximum number of challenges is reached. We find
        that the repeated low-dose challenge design does not require unfeasibly large numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX>, we are going to discuss the case of assessing whether a vaccine
        candidate induces sterilizing immunity. All the considerations in this article, however,
        apply equally to other preventive interventions, such as microbicides.
      
      
        Methods
        To assess the quality of the single and the repeated low-dose challenge designs, we
        conducted a statistical power analysis. The statistical power of an experimental design is
        defined as the probability that an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or treatment is correctly determined
        to be effective. This analysis consists of simulating the experiments, evaluating them, and
        then repeating this procedure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of times to estimate the statistical power of a
        given experimental design.
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simulation of Single Low-Dose Challenge Experiments</ENAMEX>
          In our simulations of the single low-dose challenge experiments, we assume that we
          have 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> unvaccinated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          In the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we simulate single challenges of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> by performing 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials with a probability of success of 
          p
          c = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. The probability of success corresponds to the
          probability with which an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> becomes infected after a single challenge. (By assuming
          the same probability 
          p
          c for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, we ignore potential between-animal variation
          of the susceptibility to infection. This assumption will be relaxed below.) The results
          of these trials can be written as a vector 
          
            x
          
          
          c , the entries of which were either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (uninfected) or one
          (infected):
          
          By summing over the elements of 
          
            x
          
          
          c , we obtain the number of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          
          Œπ
          c :
          
          In the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we simulate single challenges with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
          50 similarly to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> by performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials.
          However, we assume that, because of vaccination, the probability of infection (or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>) in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , is lower than that in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, 
          p
          c . The relation of 
          p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> to the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> on the susceptibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>,
          
          VE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> , is given by:
          
          The results of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials can again be written as a vector 
          
            x
          
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , and summing the elements of 
          
            x
          
          
            v
          we obtain the number of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          Œπ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> .
          The outcome of the simulated experiment can then be summarized in a contingency table
          as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. On this contingency table, we perform a standard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s
          exact test [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] to assess whether the fraction of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the vaccinated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is significantly lower than that in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simulation of Repeated Low-Dose Challenge Experiments</ENAMEX>
          In our simulations of the repeated low-dose challenge experiments, we once more assume
          that we have 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> unvaccinated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          We again simulate challenges of each control animal with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> by performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials with a probability of success of 
          p
          c = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. Unlike in the simulations of the single low-dose
          challenge experiments, however, we now repeatedly challenge each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> until it is
          infected or until a maximum number of challenges, 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , has been performed. We assume that the probability of
          infection 
          p
          c is independent of how often an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> has been challenged
          before. The results of these repeated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials can be written as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors, 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>
          
          
          c , which contains the number of challenges that have been
          performed on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>:
          
          and 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX>
          
          
          c , which contains information on whether a given animal is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uninfected</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>) or infected (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>):
          
          By summing over 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>
          
          
          c , we obtain the total number of challenges performed in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, Œ∑
          
          c :
          
          And, by summing over 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX>
          
          
          c , we obtain the number of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          
          Œπ
          c :
          
          To simulate repeated low-dose challenges in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we perform repeated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials with a probability of success 
          p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> . For a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> efficacy 
          VE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ,
          p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> is determined by equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analogously</ENAMEX> to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          the results of these repeated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials can be written as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors, 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX>
          
          
            v
          and 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX>
          
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , and summing the elements of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vectors yields the total
          number of challenges performed in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, Œ∑
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , and, the number of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          Œπ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> .
          As in the case of the single low-dose challenge design, the outcome of the simulated
          experiment can be summarized in a contingency table (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). To assess whether the
          fraction of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is significantly lower than that in
          the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we again perform a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. In general,
          the number of challenges, Œ∑
          
            c
          and Œ∑
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , is larger than the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . This increase of numbers in the contingency table leads to
          increased statistical power of the repeated low-dose challenge design. To analyze the
          outcome of the simulated repeated low-dose challenge experiments, we chose to use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test rather than a more obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards model because the
          latter depends on large sample asymptotics while we were interested in cases of small
          numbers of experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infection Probabilities</ENAMEX>
          In our mml:mathematical description of challenge experiments, we have assumed that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> have equal infection probabilities‚Äî
          p
          c and 
          p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> , for the control and vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, respectively. To
          simulate potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal-to-animal</ENAMEX> variation in susceptibility to infection, we relaxed
          this assumption and assigned individual infection probabilities to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>.
          The individual infection probabilities are drawn from a Œ≤-distribution, which is often
          used as a prior distribution for binomial proportions. The Œ≤-distribution has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shape
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameters, Œ± and Œ≤.</ENAMEX> Its probability density is given by
          
          and its mean and variance are
          
          
          We assume that Œº = 
          p
          c in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and Œº = 
          p
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v =</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ‚àí

          p
          c in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Further, we assume that the
          coefficients of variation, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">= œÉ/Œº</ENAMEX>, of the distributions in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are equal. With these
          assumptions, we can rewrite the two shape parameters of the Œ≤-distribution, Œ± and Œ≤, in
          terms of the infection probability, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>, and the coefficient of variation, 
          CV:

          p
          c for the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          To incorporate potential heterogeneity in susceptibility into the virtual low-dose
          challenge experiments, we replaced the probability of success in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernoulli</ENAMEX> trials
          (see above) with the individual infection probabilities.
        
        
          Power Analysis
          To calculate the statistical power of the single and the repeated low-dose challenge
          designs, we performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> such simulated experiments for a given number, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The statistical power can be estimated as the
          fraction of simulated experiments in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> is found to be significantly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacious</ENAMEX> (significance level Œ± = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>). We estimated the statistical power for the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one to 20</TIMEX>, and for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> efficacies 
          VE
          S = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>. The power analysis outlined above was
          implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Statistical Computing</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-script that performs
          the power analysis presented here is provided as Protocol <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S1</TIMEX>.
          For large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, the statistical power can be approximated using asymptotic theory.
          For the single low-dose challenge design the power is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately</NUMEX> (e.g., [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p.</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>):

          and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probability Œ±</ENAMEX> (the significance level). Furthermore, 
          p
          c and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v</ENAMEX> denote the infection probabilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the control
          and vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, respectively, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The term 1/
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> in the numerator is the continuity correction [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,28</NUMEX>].
          For the repeated low-dose challenge design, the number of challenges is not the same
          as the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, but is a random variable. The number of challenges for each
          individual is geometrically distributed with a maximum of 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> . The expected number of challenges in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,</ENAMEX>
          and the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, are
          
          and
          
          Substituting the expected number of challenges for the actual number, we can
          approximate the statistical power of the repeated low-dose challenge design as
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hereby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Œ≥</ENAMEX> = (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/‚å©Œ∑</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v ‚å™)/2</ENAMEX> is the continuity correction. For 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> reduces to equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>. Because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximation</ENAMEX> in equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> involves the substitution of a random variable with its
          expectation, it is less accurate than the approximation for the power of the single

          contains a function that calculates the statistical power using equation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Single <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Low-Dose Challenge Design Requires Large Numbers of Animals</ENAMEX>
          How would we measure protection against infection in a low-dose challenge model? The
          most straight-forward design would involve a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, some vaccinated and
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unvaccinated</ENAMEX>. After challenge with a low dose, one would determine the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fraction of</TIMEX>
          infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> in vaccinated and unvaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and assess whether there is a
          statistically significant difference in the fractions (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>).
          To assess how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> would be required in a single low-dose challenge
          experiment, we performed a statistical power analysis (see Methods). The statistical
          power of an experimental design is defined as the probability that, in an experiment with
          an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> is correctly determined to be effective. Obviously the
          power depends on the efficacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> (which is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúeffect size‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the
          context of power analysis) and the number of host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> used in the experiment. In the
          power analysis we performed, we assumed that we had equal numbers of unvaccinated and
          vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> within a group were equally susceptible to
          infection. Lastly, we assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> was ‚Äúleaky‚Äù [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,30</NUMEX>], i.e., that the
          susceptibility of vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> was by a constant factor lower than the
          susceptibility of the unvaccinated control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          In virtual experiments, we then challenged each (virtual) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> once with a challenge
          dose of one 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> , the dose at which on average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the unvaccinated animals
          become infected after a single challenge. Using a one-sided <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test, we
          tested whether the fraction of infected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the vaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was significantly
          lower than in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> such virtual experiments for a given
          number 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, we estimated the statistical power as the fraction
          of virtual experiments that yielded significant results (significance level Œ± =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>).
          The result of this power analysis is shown by the green curves in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. We
          calculated the power for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> efficacies of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>. We found that, even for
          the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> efficacy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>, the single low-dose challenge design required more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to reach a statistical power of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>. Thus, the single low-dose
          challenge design is not feasible, or at least not practical, to assess the efficacy of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or other preventive interventions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Repeated <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Low-Dose Challenge Design Does Not Require Large Numbers of Animals</ENAMEX>
          We propose an alternative design involving repeated challenges of individual animals
          with low doses, which circumvents the disadvantage of the single low-dose challenge
          design that large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host individuals</ENAMEX> are required. Repeated challenges
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">effectively ‚Äúrecycle‚Äù host animals</ENAMEX>, thus increasing the statistical power of the
          experiment. In addition to increasing the statistical power of the experimental design,
          repeated challenges recapitulate much more realistically the circumstances of human
          exposure than single challenges. In this alternative design, the efficacy of a vaccine
          can be estimated by measuring the difference in the number of challenges needed to infect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">vaccinated</ENAMEX> versus unvaccinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>).
          To show that this alternative design does not require unfeasibly large numbers of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, we performed a statistical power analysis (see Methods). As for the single
          low-dose design, we assumed that we had equal numbers of unvaccinated and vaccinated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> within a group were equally susceptible to infection. We
          further made the important assumption that the susceptibility of an individual animal was
          independent of how often the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was unsuccessfully challenged previously. This
          assumption is commonly adopted in statistical models that are used to estimate the
          transmission rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14‚Äì17</NUMEX>]. By making this assumption, we ignored that an
          unsuccessful challenge may induce some degree of immunity against subsequent challenges.
          We would like to emphasize, however, that this assumption is not crucial for our
          argument, unless the degree of induced immunity is very high. Lastly, we again assumed
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> was leaky [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,30</NUMEX>].
          In virtual experiments, we then challenged the (virtual) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> repeatedly with a
          challenge dose of one 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> . We allowed for a maximum number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> challenges of each
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> shows the outcome of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such virtual experiment. We analyzed
          the outcome of the virtual experiments with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test (see
          Methods). We again estimated the statistical power by performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> such virtual
          experiments for a given number 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> shows the statistical power of the repeated low-dose challenge design as a
          function of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for varying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine efficacies</ENAMEX> (black lines),
          and compares it to the statistical power of the single low-dose challenge design (green
          lines). The statistical power achieved with the repeated low-dose challenge design is
          generally higher than that achieved with the single low-dose challenge design. If the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> effective (
          VE
          S = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>), i.e., it reduces the susceptibility by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>,
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as five</NUMEX> to achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 95%</NUMEX>
          statistical power. In contrast, in single low-dose challenge experiments with the same
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> the statistical power is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 15%</NUMEX>. Thus, repeated low-dose
          challenge experiments are expected to require far fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> than single low-dose
          challenge experiments.
        
        
          How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Often Should Virus Challenges Be Repeated</ENAMEX>?
          To investigate how the maximum number of challenges affected the statistical power, we
          plotted the power against 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> for trials involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          We found that the power increases with 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , but for high 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> the returns diminished considerably. The lower the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, the higher the maximum number of challenges, 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , for which the power effectively saturated. Even for low
          numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>, however, the maximum number of challenges, 
          C
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> , needed to unfold the full potential of the repeated low-dose
          challenge design was in a feasible range.
        
        
          Impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animal-to-Animal Variation in Susceptibility</ENAMEX>
          To study how potential heterogeneity in susceptibility affected the power of low-dose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">challenge</ENAMEX> trials, we simulated experiments in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was assigned an
          individual infection probability (see Methods). In these simulations, the degree of
          heterogeneity was measured by the coefficient of variation, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>, of the susceptibility distributions. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX> shows susceptibility
          distributions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> .
          We extended our power analysis by considering the impact of the heterogeneity
          parameter 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> on the statistical power (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). We found that the statistical
          power of the single low-dose challenge design was almost unaffected by animal-to-animal
          variation in infection probability, whereas, for the repeated low-dose challenge design,
          the power decreased with increasing heterogeneity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, however, the power did
          not decrease linearly with heterogeneity: it was sufficiently stable in the range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> < 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> and dropped mainly for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>. Thus, over a wide range of potential animal-to-animal
          variation in susceptibility, low-dose challenge designs are sufficiently powered, and the
          power of the repeated low-dose experiments is superior to that of single low-dose
          challenge experiments.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Preclinical studies assessing the efficacy of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, microbicides, or
        systemic chemoprophylaxis are usually conducted with very high virus challenge doses, which
        result in infection with certainty. Since these high challenge doses do not reflect the low
        probability of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> or prophylactic treatment strategies
        that are effective against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúreal life‚Äù</ENAMEX> exposures may go undetected in high-dose challenge
        experiments. For example, zidovudine was found to prevent a large fraction of perinatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infections [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], even though studies in animal models, conducted with high challenge doses,
        could not establish any protection against infection by zidovudine [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20‚Äì22</NUMEX>].
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we investigated how efficacy trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> and preventive treatment
        could be conducted with low challenge doses in animal models. We showed that the repeated
        low-dose challenge design is expected to require far fewer experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> than
        commonly believed. It may therefore be feasible to conduct trials with low challenge doses,
        which more realistically simulate exposures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, allowing us to more directly
        and sensitively assess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or treatment efficacy than with high-dose challenge
        experiments.
        Owing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> with high challenge doses, several research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, including our
        own, have started to develop low-dose challenge models [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31‚Äì34</NUMEX>]. In these preliminary
        studies, infection could be achieved by challenging macaques <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intra-rectally</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>],
        intra-vaginally [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,34</NUMEX>], or orally [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>].
        Since adopting low-dose challenge approaches has far-reaching consequences for the
        design of efficacy trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> or preventive treatment in animal models, we would
        like to discuss how some important aspects of trial design, such as transient infections,
        the challenge schedule, the route of infection, and the phenotype and dose of the challenge
        strain, should be dealt with and could be optimized.
        Using virus challenge doses that do not give rise to infection with certainty, one has
        to carefully define what one means by successful infection. This question is of particular
        importance in the repeated low-dose challenge design, because the efficacy of a preventive
        intervention is estimated on the basis of the number of challenges needed to infect an
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. Low-dose challenges have been observed to give rise to transiently
        detectable viremia [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32‚Äì34</NUMEX>]. Since transient infection is much more likely to lead to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunization</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], thus leading to lower probabilities of infection in subsequent
        challenges, we suggest considering transient viremia as successful infection and not to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that were transiently infected.
        The time interval between challenges is also an essential parameter in the design of
        repeated low-dose challenge experiments. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> ongoing repeated low-dose challenge
        studies [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31‚Äì34</NUMEX>], different approaches have been taken, with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">time</TIMEX> intervals ranging from
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to a week. There may be logistical reasons for choosing short time intervals between
        challenges, but from a statistical standpoint, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time</TIMEX> intervals should be large enough to
        allow the identification of the challenge that gives rise to infection. Otherwise, the
        statistical power of the experimental design will be suboptimal and a beneficial effect of
        the vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> may be missed.
        In parallel to using more realistic, lower challenge doses, other crucial parameters of
        the experimental infection process, such as the route of transmission and the coreceptor
        usage of the challenge virus, should also be chosen to be as realistic as possible. Thus,
        we propose infecting intra-vaginally or intra-rectally in experiments that aim to assess a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or prophylactic treatment against sexual transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. Further, we suggest
        using challenge viruses that utilize CCR5 as coreceptor, such as for example SHIV-SF162P
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], rather than the standard strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SHIV89.6P</ENAMEX>, which has been found to use mainly CXCR4
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,38</NUMEX>]. These more realistic choices of the route of infection and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coreceptor</ENAMEX> usage will
        permit the assessment of the efficacy of the preventive intervention in a setting that more
        accurately reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> exposures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and will enable us to carefully investigate
        the processes that give rise to infection.
        The challenge dose in a low-dose challenge study is another parameter of crucial
        importance. Although the most realistic choice would be a challenge dose that gives rise to
        infection with a probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 0.0005‚</NUMEX>Äì0.10 [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14‚Äì17</NUMEX>], such extremely low doses
        would require unfeasibly large numbers of repeated challenges per <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. Moreover, there
        is substantial variation in transmission rates due to differences in factors such as virus
        load or the presence of other infections of the genital tract [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15‚Äì18</NUMEX>], and theoretical
        studies suggest that preventing the transmission events that occur with higher probability
        would have a disproportionately large effect on controlling the epidemic [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. To maximize
        their epidemiological relevance, low-dose challenge experiments should therefore involve
        challenge doses that reflect transmission probabilities at the upper end of the spectrum.
        As a compromise between the practicality of high doses and the sensitivity associated with
        realistically low doses, we propose the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50</TIMEX> can be estimated using well-established nonparametric methods like
        Spearman-K√§rber [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>] or single-parameter methods [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>], and there is software available,
        such as a freely distributed package called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ID50</ENAMEX> developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Spouge</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ncbi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nlm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/CBBresearch/Spouge/Virology/</ENAMEX>, which allows an automated
        estimation of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> from data generated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">titration</ENAMEX> experiments.
        The inability to detect sterilizing immunity in high-dose challenge experiments led to a
        shift of focus towards indirect effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> on the pathogenicity of the
        infection and the infectiousness of the vaccinee. This shift of focus required the
        development of novel statistical models that allowed the estimation of these indirect
        effects [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,43</NUMEX>]. Will the estimation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> efficacy in repeated low-dose challenge
        studies also require the development of novel statistical techniques? The answer to this
        question depends on how much the realities of the infection process deviate from our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">idealized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> potential deviations. First, we assumed in large parts of
        this study that the susceptibilities to infection were equal for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. This is almost certainly not the case. Although we have shown that low-dose
        challenge experiments are sufficiently powered even if there is substantial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal-to-animal</ENAMEX> variation in susceptibility, we did not develop the statistical techniques
        that would allow the estimation of this variation. The extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal-to-animal</ENAMEX> variation
        in susceptibility can, in principle, be estimated, but this will probably require larger
        numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> than the estimation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> efficacy. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> may affect
        the susceptibility of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> differently. While we assumed in the present study
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> is leaky, i.e., that the susceptibility is reduced by a constant factor in
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, other modes of action of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> are possible. In particular, some animals
        could be completely protected by vaccination, while others may remain completely
        susceptible. This mode of action is referred to as all-or-none [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29,30</NUMEX>]. Statistical methods
        based on maximum likelihood approaches exist that allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the mode of
        action of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. However, these methods are based on large sample asymptotics,
        and exact methods will have to be developed to analyze the outcome of low-dose challenge
        experiments that involve small numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX>, it will have to be determined
        whether the probability of infection changes with the number of challenges performed in a
        given <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, or, to put it differently, whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmemory‚Äù</ENAMEX> of previous
        challenges. In our analysis, we assumed that the susceptibility of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> did not change
        from challenge to challenge. If the probability of infection changes significantly with the
        number of challenges, however, the development of novel statistical models that take such
        changes into account will be necessary to adequately estimate vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to the potential to assess the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or microbicide efficacy more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensitively</ENAMEX> and in a more realistic setting, a low-dose challenge approach may enable us to
        answer questions that cannot even be asked in high-dose challenge models. Some of the most
        relevant of these questions relate to the effect of challenges that do not lead to
        infection. If a low-dose challenge does not give rise to infection, where was the virus
        blocked? Did the virus fail to establish an infection at all? Or did it replicate
        transiently, but was cleared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s immunity? And, very importantly, is an
        unsuccessfully challenged animal partially immunized against further challenges, or,
        alternatively, do unsuccessful challenges facilitate future infection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúseeding‚Äù animals</ENAMEX>
        with defective proviruses that may recombine with complementing viruses upon subsequent
        exposures [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]?
        The answers to these questions would greatly enhance our understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> and pathogenesis, and thus would provide further guidance toward an effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> or microbicide. Furthermore, by assessing the protection against infection
        directly, we may be able to discern the specific types and levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>-induced
        cellular and humoral immune responses associated with sterilizing immunity [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This would
        provide important benchmarks by which to judge new vaccine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, and could also allow
        retrospective analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> candidates evaluated earlier in high-dose challenge
        studies.
        In conclusion, the repeated low-dose challenge approach may enable us to assess the
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> and prophylactic treatment strategies more realistically,
        and more sensitively than the standard high-dose challenge approach. The increased
        sensitivity may allow us to more rapidly identify interventions that significantly reduce
        the transmission of low-dose infections that characterize the natural spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
