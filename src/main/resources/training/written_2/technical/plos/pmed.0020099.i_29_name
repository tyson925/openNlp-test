        Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> today enter a profession defined by stark contrasts. In developed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, public health improvements have nearly doubled life expectancy in the last
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, and sophisticated technology and innovative research hold the promise of longer
        and higher quality life. At the same time, life-threatening infectious diseases such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> continue to affect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and a rapidly escalating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pandemic</ENAMEX> now kills <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 8,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. New <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are being
        developed at a record pace, but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that reach the market are aimed at
        treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">neglected diseases</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kala-azar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chagas</ENAMEX>' disease, and sleeping sickness,
        even though these account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 10%</NUMEX> of the global disease burden [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Both within and
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, the gap between wealthy and poor has continued to grow, leading to
        widening disparities in health outcomes.
        Despite these contrasts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>-in-training around the globe—in rich and poor
        countries—have a common goal: we seek the skills and knowledge to improve the health of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> as we devote ourselves to a career of service. The
        transformative quest to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> imbues the learner with insights from within and
        outside the profession of medicine. As medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, we hold ourselves accountable to
        our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and we critically evaluate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of our profession as we see it with new
        eyes.
        This issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> heralds the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student Forum</ENAMEX> section, a space
        where medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from across the world can exchange ideas about the critical issues
        affecting health and health care from their unique perspective. It is appropriate, then, in
        this inaugural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student Forum</ENAMEX>, that we consider some of the key issues of information
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX> in the context of global disease and medical education. How do we access
        information? How is that information shaped and influenced? How can we shape the content of
        the debate?
      
      
        Open Access to the Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Literature: Critical for Our Future</ENAMEX>
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>-in-training, we appreciate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> we will practice will differ
        from that practiced by our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>. Mastery of access to information now trumps
        mastery of facts, and we enter an era of medical practice that will develop synergistically
        with biomedical research. Our generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> will face the daunting task of
        translating an exploding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of biomedical and clinical research into medical practice.
        This task increasingly relies not only on the ability to access all the available medical
        literature, but on the ability to mine and synthesize it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a number
        of possible approaches toward ensuring free and open access to the world's literature [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>],
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> should be at the forefront of this movement.
        As the democratization of access brings developed and developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> together, the
        very content of the research published should follow suit. Too often the thoughts and
        opinions of those in the rich world have dominated research agendas and the content of
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 8%</NUMEX> of articles published in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> leading
        tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000–2002</NUMEX> were generated exclusively by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> from
        developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Bringing the entire world of learners into a global conversation
        should be accompanied by a shift in editorial priorities to ensure that medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>
        inform practice in a way that offers the greatest benefits to those suffering the greatest
        burdens.
      
      
        The Influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmaceutical Industry</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> pride themselves on publishing high-quality research
        subjected to rigorous peer review. Indeed, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has contributed to significant
        advances in the standards for clinical investigation and rightly drives much of clinical
        practice. However, without the least bit of acknowledged irony, medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> have begun
        publishing articles about how pharmaceutical industry advertising and marketing drives
        clinical practice in nonrational ways while at the same time publishing the very
        advertisements they critique.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical Student Association</ENAMEX> (AMSA), which has entered into a formal
        partnership with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , accepts no pharmaceutical industry funding and encourages
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to eschew the industry largess through its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">“PharmFree”</ENAMEX> initiative
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amsa</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/prof/pharmfree.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cfm</ENAMEX>). Similar initiatives are afoot in medical student
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> around the world as we consider appropriate relationships with industry.
        Surely it is time that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> examine the content of their pages and stop serving as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> through which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> practice is influenced by industry. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> is the first major international general medical journal to
        refuse to advertise medical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> or devices [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. We hope that other major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> will
        follow suit.
      
      
        The Need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student Ideals</ENAMEX> and Ideas
        Throughout the world, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> represent the leading edge of social change. Indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paulo</ENAMEX>
        Freire, one of the most influential educational thinkers of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 20th century</TIMEX>,
        describes education as the “practice of freedom,” as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">learners</ENAMEX> continuously work to
        integrate action and reflection in a spiral of deepening connections. This process of
        integration is rooted in a deep-seated longing for the possible, informed by the lived
        experience of the painful. Nowhere is this more true than in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, where the suffering
        of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> underpins our scientific inquiry, our clinical development, and our
        personal growth as healers.
        As we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> learn medicine, we begin to ask hard questions about the proximal—and the
        distal—causes of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' suffering. The reductionistic logic of medical education
        offers only false comfort, and only to those who content themselves with pathways and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Learners</ENAMEX> want to understand what led to the derangement of the pathway, of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Genes? Environmental factors? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics</ENAMEX>? In asking, we bring a sense of
        possibility, of hope, to the process. What 
        could be? What tools do we need to address these broader causes? And we
        hope that thinking about these questions from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>'s view may offer our senior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> a chance to reflect on their own work as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and their own place in our
        world.
        We hope this space emerges as a vibrant source of student energy and passion, grounded
        in evidence, accountable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who will entrust their care to us, and reflecting
        the hope we have for the future of medicine.
      
      
        Toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Future</ENAMEX>
        As we come together from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> continents to inaugurate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student Forum</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , we are committed to ensuring that this section of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> remains a source of vigorous debate and thoughtful analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> will
        initially be published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX>, and will contain essays of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 1,000</NUMEX> words that address
        any health-related issue from a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> perspective (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>).
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, which currently has
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical Student Association</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Medical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Medical Students' Association</ENAMEX>, will be involved in selecting
        and editing essays for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student Forum</ENAMEX> will be freely available for all to read and critique, free from
        inappropriate financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX>, and committed to the drive toward justice that student
        ideals embody. We look forward to helping shape this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> in the best traditions of free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>, and we look forward to collaboration with our senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> to hold us to
        these standards.
