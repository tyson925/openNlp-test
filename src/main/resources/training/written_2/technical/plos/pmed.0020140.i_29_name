        An <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Caucasian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> with type 1 diabetes presented to the emergency department
        complaining of severe left knee pain and swelling after sustaining a knee injury that
        occurred during a high school football match. Joint effusions were visible and palpable
        above the left knee, and there was significant loss of smooth motion of the knee, passively
        performed. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Plain X</ENAMEX> rays showed no signs of fractures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had had type 1 diabetes
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> regimen consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin glargine</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">p.m.</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin lispro</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 a.m.</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 p.m.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had
        no apparent complications related to type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        On examination he was alert, his pulse was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> bpm regular, and his blood pressure was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">118/66 mm Hg</ENAMEX>. Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had had frequent episodes of both hyperglycemia and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX>. However, he had never developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diabetic ketoacidosis</ENAMEX> (DKA). His recent HbA1c
        was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.5%</NUMEX>, demonstrating inadequate glycemic control.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was referred to an orthopedic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX>, and arthroscopy was scheduled a few
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days later</TIMEX>. A complex tear of the medial meniscus extending to the articular surfaces was
        diagnosed. Partial meniscectomy was recommended. (This procedure usually takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about one</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hour—nonetheless</ENAMEX>, the preoperative preparation for general anesthesia and the postoperative
        recovery may add <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> to this time.)
        
          When <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Would You Have This Patient Report</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital</ENAMEX>? The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> before Surgery or
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Morning of Surgery</ENAMEX>?
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> should be hospitalized no later than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> before surgery, given
          his history of frequent episodes of hypo- and hyperglycemia and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> glycemic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. This should allow for final optimization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> control before surgery.
          Ideally, frequent contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and adjustment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> regimen prior to
          surgery should lead to an excellent glycemic control. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 18-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glargine</ENAMEX> might benefit from additional doses of lispro given before lunch and dinner
          (rather than at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 p.m.</TIMEX>, unless this is before dinner).
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with poorly controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> should not undergo elective surgery until
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycemic</ENAMEX> levels are reasonably controlled. For example, bringing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl will likely result in a canceled surgery.
          If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> of admission surgery, one way to avoid having to send
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> out without being able to do the procedure is to perform a finger stick blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> on arrival so one can cancel before admission.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> undergoing minor surgical procedures (e.g., arthroscopy) may be brought to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of surgery. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is usually NPO (i.e., has been
          given orders to fast before the surgery), a lower dose of the intermediate- or
          long-acting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is administered, and the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is withheld (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Insulin</ENAMEX>
          therapy should never be withheld in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> as this can result in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Should His Insulin Be Managed before Surgery</ENAMEX>?
          The degree of metabolic control should be carefully evaluated before surgery; the goal
          is to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> readings on an outpatient basis before
          undergoing surgery. If hyperglycemia has been present for a prolonged period of time
          before surgery, this could result in dehydration, which is commonly associated with
          electrolytic abnormalities such as sodium and potassium loss and possibly intravascular
          volume depletion. Prolonged hyperglycemia will delay healing and increase the risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX>. A number of observations have indicated that hyperglycemia impairs collagen
          formation and causes a decrease in the tensile strength of surgical wounds [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>]. Simply
          avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hyperglycemia</ENAMEX> can prevent these consequences. The reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">below 200 mg/dl</ENAMEX> has been shown to improve granulocyte adherence and granulocytosis, both
          key components of the innate immunity and the defense against bacterial infections.
          Studies in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> suggest that high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels might exacerbate
          ischemic brain damage [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
          Admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> is recommended for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and a
          stabilization period of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12–16 hours</TIMEX> is also recommended for urgent procedures if severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperglycemia</ENAMEX> is present [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>]. However, the widespread use of home <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX>
          monitoring makes the improvement of glycemic control possible prior to admission.
          Traditionally, long-acting (e.g. ultralente) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> is discontinued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2–3 days</TIMEX> before
          surgery, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is stabilized on a regimen of intermediate-acting (neutral
          protamine hagedorn [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPH</ENAMEX>] or lente) and short-acting (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular</TIMEX> or humalog) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, or regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> before meals and intermediate-acting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> at bedtime. However,
          if the glycemic control is good and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is being treated with glargine, it is
          acceptable to continue the regimen until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of surgery [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Alternatively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2–2/3</NUMEX>
          of the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> regimen is given on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the procedure [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of
          surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> should receive the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> regimen that is used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraoperatively</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
          Evaluation of metabolic homeostasis, lipid profile, and kidney and myocardial function
          must be completed before surgery. The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetic autonomic neuropathy</ENAMEX> should
          also be assessed prior to surgery because this condition predisposes to perioperative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotension</ENAMEX>. In such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> meticulous monitoring of blood pressure and volume status
          is essential during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the perioperative period</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          The common agreement is that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4–8 hours</TIMEX> before surgery, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> should be kept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPO</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcutaneous</ENAMEX> (SC) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> should be discontinued, and an intravenous (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) infusion line
          should be inserted. It should be emphasized that if the elective surgical procedure can
          be scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning hours</TIMEX> and the procedure lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least four hours</TIMEX>, this
          limits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPO</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 4–6 hours</TIMEX> and allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of usual or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/2–2/3</NUMEX> usual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose infusion</ENAMEX> to replace breakfast and supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          either subcutaneously or intravenously. If both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> are infused, it
          should be pointed out that these must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separately controlled infusions, so glucose
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> infusion can be varied independently.
        
        
          How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Should His Insulin Be Managed during Surgery</ENAMEX>?
          Major surgery and general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anesthesia</ENAMEX> can cause severe metabolic abnormalities in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Given the limitations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SC insulin</ENAMEX> therapy, such as
          unpredictable absorption and variable plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels, constant infusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          is recommended [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Anesthesia induces complex neuroendocrine stress responses and
          activates the sympathetic nervous system. The abnormal release of growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>,
          cortisol, and epinephrine leads to impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin secretion</ENAMEX>, and causes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          resistance and hyperglycemia due to increased glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">decreased glucose</ENAMEX> disposal. Many other conditions may cause severe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance in
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 3</ENAMEX>).
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> scheduled for elective surgery, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose infusion</ENAMEX> are
          usually started <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> preoperatively, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels should be maintained
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl. Slightly higher targets (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100–150 mg/dl</ENAMEX>) have been recommended
          by some diabetologists to minimize the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX>. The maintenance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          levels below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl has been shown to prevent bacterial infections and ischemic brain
          damage [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,8</NUMEX>]. Suggested guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> by use
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> are outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> has a short half-life (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX> is of little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, as the infusion can be decreased and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          glucose rate increased. The infusion rate can be adjusted by a floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> before surgery
          and by the anesthesiologist intraoperatively. An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin infusion algorithm</ENAMEX> is
          constructed to allow easy titration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> dose, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> must also be
          infused to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">target</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>). This type of algorithm is
          effective in the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>; however, it is based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">“average”</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and
          might require individualization. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has a coexisting condition associated
          with increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> requirement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> doses need to be increased. Glycemic
          levels must be monitored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> intervals to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 125</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/dl.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> who are treated with continuous SC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> infusion by
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> pump should be easily converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> infusion just before
          surgery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continuous SC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> infusion is an acceptable regimen for surgical procedures
          requiring local anesthesia.
        
        
          How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Should Fluids and Electrolytes Be Managed in This Patient</ENAMEX>?
          An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> without diabetes requires a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 to 125 grams</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 to 500</NUMEX> calories)
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> per day to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein catabolism</ENAMEX> and the development of ketosis. Hence,
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with types 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> should be treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5–10 grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> per hour
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/kg/min</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-kilogram subject) to provide sufficient basal energy
          requirement and prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX> during surgery. The dextrose concentration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>
          solution (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>) is adjusted based on the expected length of surgery. Thus, in this case
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of dextrose in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D5W</NUMEX>) can be administered intravenously via infusion pump. For
          longer surgical procedures (intraabdominal or intrathoracic surgery), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of dextrose
          should be used to avoid excessive fluid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20% or 50%</NUMEX> dextrose solution
          can be infused through a central venous catheter if fluid restriction is critical. If
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> are required, for instance, to replace unexpected intraoperative blood
          losses, non-glucose-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> should be administered.
          As a general rule, normal serum potassium levels do not necessarily imply that the
          total body potassium content is normal, as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2%</NUMEX> of total body potassium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, the metabolic homeostasis can rapidly be
          altered and many factors may influence serum potassium levels and total body potassium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. These factors are (a) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, which increases potassium uptake by cells; (b)
          acidemia, which causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperkalemia</ENAMEX> as a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of intracellular
          potassium for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen ions</ENAMEX>; and (c) hyperosmolarity, which causes a rearrangement of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potassium</ENAMEX> and fluid from intracellular to extracellular compartments. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> who have normal renal function and normal serum potassium concentration, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 mEq</TIMEX> of potassium should be added to each liter of dextrose-containing fluid. A higher
          dose is required in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hypokalemia. If serum potassium levels are greater than
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mEq</ENAMEX>/l, potassium therapy should be withheld from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> and potassium serum
          levels should be monitored closely.
        
        
          How Would the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Patient Be Different for Emergency Rather Than</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elective Surgery</ENAMEX>?
          It has been estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 5%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> require surgery
          at some point during their lives [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergo emergency surgery as
          a result of lower extremity infections requiring incision and drainage or even lower limb
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amputations</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 50%</NUMEX> of lower limb amputations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> occur among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> admitted for emergency
          procedures have a poor glyco-metabolic control and some of them may have coexisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX>.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in management is to assess glycemic, electrolyte, acid-base, and volume
          status. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> saline infusion should be started while waiting for laboratory tests to
          correct possible volume loss. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin infusion</ENAMEX> should be started at an appropriate rate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>), and frequently <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> requirement might increase during emergency surgery. It
          is crucial that volume losses and electrolyte abnormalities are corrected prior to
          surgery.
          If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX> is diagnosed, immediate treatment is indicated, and, if possible, surgery
          should be delayed until the glyco-metabolic control is corrected and stabilized. If
          emergency surgery procedures cannot be delayed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX> can be treated concurrently with
          surgery.
        
        
          How Should the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Postoperative Glyco-Metabolic Management Be Handled in This</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patient</ENAMEX>?
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D5W</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.45%</NUMEX> normal saline) infusion should be continued
          until the glycol-metabolic control is stable and until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1–2 hours</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is
          able to resume oral feeding without difficulty. If postoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nausea</ENAMEX> and vomiting are
          present, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> infusion should not be discontinued. Furthermore, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketonuria</ENAMEX> could be an early sign of impending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX>, which
          could be triggered by starvation. Capillary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> should be monitored every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1–2 hours</TIMEX>
          at the bedside, and the variable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> infusion should be adjusted to
          maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> levels between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 4</ENAMEX>). Serum electrolytes
          should be measured immediately after surgery. Hypo- and hyperkalemia are fairly common in
          the postoperative period and should be corrected without delay. The presence of a widened
          anion gap suggests the possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX> or lactic acidosis that might be caused by
          systemic infections or hypoperfusion.
          If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is stable and can tolerate oral feeding, the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> dose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> may be administered <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20–30 minutes</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> infusion
          stopped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15–20 minutes</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>. Of note, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> infusion should be discontinued
          only after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> regimen is started to avoid any gaps in plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> levels
          that may lead to a loss of metabolic control.
          Resuming a sliding scale SC <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> treatment postoperatively has been advocated to
          improve metabolic control in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. However, there are several
          drawbacks with this approach. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, this approach is based on a retrospective
          treatment for hyperglycemia, which reflects the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          disposal rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preoperative period</TIMEX>. The use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SC insulin</ENAMEX> treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">postoperatively</ENAMEX> tends to create fluctuations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> levels that could be
          difficult to control. Moreover, there is a risk of exposing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to the risk of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX> if excessive doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> are administered. More importantly, the use of
          a sliding scale treatment might predispose to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> before
          the development of hyperglycemic levels.
        
        
          What Are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Principles for Surgery</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type</ENAMEX> 2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes</ENAMEX>?
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 diabetes require good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> control prior to undergoing
          surgery. Although these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seldom develop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKA</ENAMEX>, the same adverse effects of poor
          glycemic control may develop. For procedures that require general anesthesia, specific
          treatment, other than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glycemic</ENAMEX> monitoring, is not required for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> diabetes whose <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is well controlled with diet (i.e., fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> less
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">than 125 mg/dl</ENAMEX>). However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> should still be administered as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperglycemic</ENAMEX> responses may still occur intraoperatively in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Targeted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycemic</ENAMEX> levels are identical to those for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. For elective
          procedures requiring general anesthesia, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> infusion is usually required to control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperglycemic</ENAMEX> levels that occur during surgery. Frequent intraoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX>
          monitoring is imperative in this setting to avoid complications resulting from a poor
          glycemic control. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> who require <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and who are scheduled
          for surgery should be managed similarly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
          As a general rule, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> should not be used in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 diabetes
          requiring surgery and general anesthesia, since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin absorption</ENAMEX> from the SC tissue
          could be quite variable, particularly in obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
          With regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> who require general anesthesia and whose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is well controlled with sulfonylureas, there is some degree of disagreement.
          Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diabetologists</ENAMEX> recommend withholding the sulfonylurea <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of surgery for
          procedures requiring general or local anesthesia and using continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
          infusion.
          Any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> treated with metformin should discontinue this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> before surgery. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> should be completely cleared after discontinuing metformin
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> preceding surgery. This is a prophylactic measure in an effort to lower the risk
          of lactic acidosis that could be secondary to complications of surgical procedures such
          as hypotension, myocardial infarction, or septic shock.
          Treatment decisions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2 diabetes receiving local anesthesia and
          undergoing minor surgical procedures are similar to those described above for patients
          with type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISCUSSION</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with type 1 diabetes undergoing elective or emergency surgical procedures have
        a higher degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality than those without <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, as a result of
        impaired glyco-metabolic homeostasis and electrolyte balance. The magnitude of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catabolic</ENAMEX> responses is not only related to the severity of surgical and postsurgical
        complications but also to the effects of inadequate perioperative management on metabolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> should be very familiar with the perioperative management of
        type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>; with individualized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose variable infusions</ENAMEX>, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        affected by type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> can undergo surgery with a minimal risk.
        The goal of glycemic management in these situations is to maintain normal glucose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homeostasis</ENAMEX> and normal metabolism. As <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance and gluconeogenesis increase
        during surgery-related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and anesthesia, additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> will be needed to prevent
        excessive hepatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> release. An important issue is maintaining a physiological fluid
        and electrolyte balance.
        Perioperative hyperglycemia increases the risk of infections, delayed wound healing, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ischemia</ENAMEX>. Achieving preprandial glycemic levels between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 and 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl before surgery in
        the preoperative period and maintaining plasma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl
        during surgery and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 100 and 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/dl after surgery using simple and safe algorithms
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boxes 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) can significantly decrease the risk of these complications.
