        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton University Press</ENAMEX>, is a work of advocacy in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> argue that
        evolutionary theory is incomplete and that, in consequence, we are failing fully to
        understand phenomena as disparate as ecosystem development and the interplay of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
        culture in shaping human evolution. What we are missing, they argue, is an appreciation of
        niche construction, the process by which an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> modifies the abiotic and biotic
        environment in which it is subject to natural selection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' major assertion is
        that the importance of niche construction is so great that it should be regarded “after
        natural selection, as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in evolution” and that it is “not just an
        important addition to evolutionary theory” but “requires a reformulation of evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theory”.</ENAMEX> Bold claims indeed.
        After introducing the conceptual framework <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odling-Smee et al.</ENAMEX> set out a series of
        arguments to support this position, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these being the empirical case for the
        existence of niche construction. Niche construction, as broadly interpreted here, is
        everywhere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> build nests, burrows, and protective cases and so alter the environment
        they experience in a way that may select for further adaptations. The changes caused by
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>, such as beavers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">earthworms</ENAMEX>, are of a sufficient magnitude that the
        environment experienced by a host of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is affected. Many plant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> also
        modify the environment they experience by generating organic litter; influencing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrological</ENAMEX> and biogeochemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>; affecting temperature, humidity, and light regimes;
        and, over the longer term, determining the make up of the atmosphere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decomposer</ENAMEX> and
        chemoautotrophic microorganisms similarly influence biogeochemical transformations, while
        parasitic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> can manipulate the behaviour and internal environment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> they
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infect</ENAMEX>. Perhaps less obvious examples of niche construction are the many types of migration
        and cultural evolution that, like physical transformations, cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> to experience a different selective environment.
        After this broad, accessible survey, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> change key rather abruptly and explore
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-locus, frequency-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> genetics. The novelty here is that selection on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> locus depends on the history of gene frequencies at the other, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">“niche construction”,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>. In an extension, gene frequencies at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> locus affect an environmental variable with
        its own dynamics that in turn influences the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> locus. As one would guess, the models
        display a range of potentially interesting dynamics, though generalisations and broad
        conclusions are sparse. We guess the aim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> is to illustrate that environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feedbacks</ENAMEX> can be potent and general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of evolutionary change, but the restriction of
        the theory to such a narrow model, with very technical explanation, risks losing the few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who we suspect will stay the course (did we really need a rederivation for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haplodiploids</ENAMEX>?).
        Perhaps aware of the dangers of getting bogged down in detail, the argument then moves
        to proving a case for the universality of niche construction. Invoking the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermodynamics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> lead us through a challenging thesis that
        concludes that the persistence of life on earth requires both natural selection and niche
        construction, thereby justifying some of the bold claims for their new theory. We think
        they are technically correct, but we are concerned that the demonstration of the
        inescapability of niche construction, as defined here, does not guarantee that it will
        actually tell us new and important things about the world, as the theory of natural
        selection has.
        The remainder of the book explores the implications of niche-construction thinking for
        evolutionary biology, ecology, and the human sciences, and in our view is the most
        successful part. Though it is rare for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> to offer new analysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX>, their
        sideways look at many issues from the niche-construction viewpoint often offers interesting
        new angles on old problems, and suggests new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> of enquiry that may be the book's
        greatest legacy. A good example of this is their convincing and timely argument that a more
        explicit recognition of evolution's role in environmental feedbacks will help to unify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population/community</ENAMEX> ecology and ecosystem science.
        The chief argument for the prosecution is that niche construction is common but not
        pervasive, and that wherever <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ecologists</ENAMEX> and evolutionists have found interesting examples
        of it, they have developed appropriate theory and concepts to understand its ramifications.
        For example, some of the clearest examples of niche construction occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> succession
        where, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F.E. Clements</ENAMEX> realised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a hundred years ago</TIMEX>, early-succession plants
        frequently modify their environment in ways that allow other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to replace the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, the strict Clementsian theory of facilitation, niche construction 
        avant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la lettre</ENAMEX> , has given way to a more pluralistic theory of
        succession. It is a great pity that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> give so little space to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and plant
        ecology, as it here that some of the finest examples of niche construction are found, as
        well as the best-developed conceptual framework for studying the roles of environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX>.
        Other areas where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> have well-developed theories of the influences and impacts
        of niche construction include co-evolutionary theory, where the environmental feedbacks are
        largely biotic, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dawkins</ENAMEX>' theory of the extended phenotype. Very close to some of the
        arguments discussed here, and generously acknowledged, is the idea developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> of ecosystem <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that have a major impact on the
        abiotic environment experienced by a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        A major strength of the book is that it reveals common processes and patterns underlying
        disparate biology in consistently interesting ways. Its chief contribution is thus not to
        tell us new things about how nature works but to link together many different aspects of
        ecology under an umbrella of theory that may in the future lead to new insights. Do they
        deliver on their grand claims? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> will tell, but our view is that they don't. They
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">engagingly</ENAMEX> admit that for their project to succeed the new theory must earn its keep by
        producing significant new biology—something which has yet to occur. However, the great need
        for the biological and human sciences to integrate across subdisciplines, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        bravely attempt here, makes this a hugely worthwhile book. Its breadth of scope and its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boldness</ENAMEX> in creating syntheses have resulted in a stimulating and challenging read.
