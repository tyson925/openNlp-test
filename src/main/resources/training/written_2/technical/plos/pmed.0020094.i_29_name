        recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, and there is much debate about exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> in early life and later
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and allergy. Some studies have suggested that keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> actually
        protects against later allergyâ€”i.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>, that early exposure may somehow modify an individual's
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> system to tolerate specific antigens. What might be the mechanism for such
        protection against allergy? One theory of how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> arise is that an imbalance in T
        helper cell subtypes tips the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s immune response towards overreacting to a particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. There is some evidence that early exposure to high natural levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> allergens
        can prevent such an inappropriate immune response. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have suggested that
        normally immune responses are kept under control by another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T cellsâ€”regulatory T</ENAMEX>
        cells. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mechanisms may be linked, since exposure to high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat allergens</ENAMEX> may
        induce regulatory T cells.
        Various attempts to modify aberrant immune responses to specific allergens, such as
        those to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat dander</ENAMEX>, have been made. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> have treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> derived from the allergen itself, or much smaller peptides
        produced synthetically. Although therapy with peptides seems to reduce allergic responses,
        the mechanism of the response to treatment has not been clear, in particular, exactly which
        cells, cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers</ENAMEX>, and cytokines are involved in modifying the immune
        response.
        In a paper in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark LarchÃ</ENAMEX>© and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have attempted to dissect out
        this pathway in a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and allergy to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>. They treated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with short synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> derived from the sequence of the major cat
        allergen, 
        Felis domesticus allergen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and then measured the clinical and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunological</ENAMEX> response to allergen. They found that treatment with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> led to the
        induction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of T cells that were capable of suppressing the proliferation of
        allergen-reactive T cells in vitro. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Peptide</ENAMEX> treatment also resulted in increased levels of
        a molecule called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD5</ENAMEX> on the surface of blood <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T cellsâ€”CD5</ENAMEX> has recently been associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suppressing T</ENAMEX> cell sensitivity to stimulation. Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found that the degree
        of suppression was not related to the amount of peptide given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Where does this finding leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who might wonder about exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and the
        development of allergy? The simple answer is that we do not know exactly how exposure to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">antigen</ENAMEX> triggers either an immune reaction or tolerance. Once triggered, an immune reaction
        to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> may be hardâ€”though not impossibleâ€”to reverse, but how or why a specific individual
        becomes sensitized is as yet far from clear.
