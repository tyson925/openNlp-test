        lower the risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX>. The mechanism for this effect is unclear. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Alzheimer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is characterized by accumulation of amyloid deposits in the brain. These deposits
        are composed of amyloid-beta (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aβ</ENAMEX>) peptide, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein fragment</ENAMEX> that is cleaved off from the
        amyloid precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein APP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APP</ENAMEX> can be cleaved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different ways. Amyloidogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(“amyloid generating”</ENAMEX>) cleavage by an enzyme called beta-secretase yields “sticky” Aβ
        peptides that aggregate to form deposits, whereas non-amyloidogenic cleavage by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-secretases generates soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> that do not form deposits. Studies in animal
        models and cell culture suggest that statins might modulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APP</ENAMEX> processing and shift the
        balance toward <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">“healthy”</ENAMEX> (non-amyloidogenic) cleavage.
        In their quest to understand how statins affect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APP</ENAMEX> processing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Gandy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        focused on a molecule called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ROCK1</ENAMEX>, a kinase enzyme that had recently been implicated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APP</ENAMEX> processing. The theoretical link between statins and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ROCK1</ENAMEX> goes as follows: statins
        inhibit the isoprenoid pathway, isoprenoids are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of the enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rho</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> in
        turn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">activates ROCK1</TIMEX>. And while such potential connections could be drawn for any number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gandy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> went on to test whether statins exert their effect on APP
        cleavage by interfering with the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">isoprenoid/Rho/ROCK1 pathway.</ENAMEX>
        Working in mouse neuroblastoma cells, they confirmed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different statins
        increased healthy cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APP</ENAMEX>. When they directly interfered with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">isoprenoid/Rho/ROCK1</ENAMEX> pathway by adding a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rho</ENAMEX> activation, they saw
        effects similar to those of the statins (i.e., an increase in healthy cleavage). The same
        effects were seen when they transfected the cells with a dominant negative form of ROCK1
        (which inactivates the normal ROCK1 molecules in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>); this outcome shows that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> can influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APP</ENAMEX> cleavage. Most conclusively, when they added a version of ROCK1
        that was constitutively (always) active, they reduced basal levels and abolished
        statin-stimulated levels of healthy cleavage.
        Taken together, these results suggest that statins influence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APP</ENAMEX> processing, at least in
        part, by modulating the isoprenoid pathway and inactivating the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ROCK1</NUMEX> kinase. Future
        studies are necessary to determine whether this mechanism is actually responsible for the
        apparent clinical benefits of statins. Another question worth exploring further is whether
        ROCK1 might be a suitable target for therapeutic interventions that aim to decrease
        harmful, and promote healthy, cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APP</ENAMEX>.
