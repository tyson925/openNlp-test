        Treatment for, and the prognosis of, type-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mellitus</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T1DM</NUMEX>) has progressed
        dramatically during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains a major cause of morbidity
        and mortality. Although precise figures are not available, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citizens</ENAMEX> currently live with the disease, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30,000</NUMEX> new cases diagnosed in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. The total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> worldwide is expected to rise to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX>, up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">171 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        The exact etiology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> remains uncertain, but extensive research suggests an
        interaction between genetic predisposition and environment. In fact, for unknown reasons,
        the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1DM</ENAMEX> is increasing [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetes</ENAMEX> continues to have a tremendous societal
        impact; it is both difficult and expensive to treat and is associated with a number of
        long-term complications, including kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">failure</ENAMEX>, blindness, nerve damage, and premature
        mortality (predominately due to cardiovascular problems).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Insulin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impact</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Best</ENAMEX>'s discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1920s</TIMEX> revolutionized diabetes
        treatment and greatly improved the prognosis for what had previously been a rapidly fatal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. As shown by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetes Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Complications Trial</ENAMEX> and the more recent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Complications</ENAMEX> trial, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> therapy has made
        such considerable advances (with better <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin formulations</ENAMEX> and delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>) that
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can maintain their blood sugar levels within a tight range and thereby reduce
        their risk for the disease's long-term complications [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>]. In addition, improved
        treatment of other associated conditions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> and hyperlipidemia have
        helped reduce, or at least delay, many of the long-term sequelae of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. However,
        problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-based treatment regimens persist. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, treatment is
        expensive and difficult, requiring strict attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> monitoring, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        dosing, diet, and exercise. Further, good glycemia control is not easily achieved by all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and even for those able to achieve this goal, the treatment is not always
        completely effective.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promising Directions</ENAMEX>
        Just as financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> balance a portfolio, with some risky investments and others
        that are more secure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> will undoubtedly continue to further refine ‚Äúsecure‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-based regimens to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> achieve even better glycemia control. At the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are pursuing more high-risk, high-payoff approaches to revolutionize
        diabetes care. One such approach is the closed-loop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> pump (i.e., a pump that
        continuously monitors <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> and concurrently converts that data into appropriate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin dosing</ENAMEX>), which offers the potential to serve as a mechanical pancreas. However,
        such a mechanical system would need be fail-safe in order to avoid devastating effects
        (e.g., if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> were to register a falsely elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> and thereby trigger
        an inappropriately high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> dose). In other, similar scenarios with no tolerance for
        error, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> (for instance) sets up systems in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent monitoring systems must
        come up with similar measurements before an action is taken. Perhaps the engineering
        obstacles that currently limit the closed-loop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> pump can be overcome.
        Other research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are investigating whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-producing cells within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pancreas</ENAMEX> (so-called √ü <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>), might be promoted to regenerate (in vitro or in vivo) to
        replace the pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> reduced by autoimmune destruction. Another
        promising approach for creating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> capable of physiologically regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> is to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúcoax‚Äù stem cells‚Äîundifferentiated cells with self-regenerative capacity‚Äîto
        differentiate into √ü-like cells. Gene therapy approaches may overcome present obstacles and
        result in cells capable of physiologically regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin secretion</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Lastly, the
        recent completion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Genome Project</ENAMEX> suggests that the genetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> may
        eventually become clearer and may direct appropriate preventative approaches.
        While such potential therapies remain experimental, pancreas transplantation is
        currently performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with complicated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. However, a recent report that
        shows benefit for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">failure</ENAMEX> who receive a combined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pancreas</ENAMEX> and kidney transplant also found that an isolated pancreas transplant (for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with preserved kidney function) actually worsened survival [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The main point is
        that as we develop new therapies, we must maintain humility and recognize that newer
        approaches may have great promise, but they also have the potential for harm.
      
      
        History of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islet Transplantation</ENAMEX>
        Islet transplantation has recently received considerable interest as a potentially
        definitive treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. The concept of islet transplantation is not
        new‚Äîinvestigators as early as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Pybus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1882‚Äì1975</ENAMEX>) attempted to
        graft pancreatic tissue to cure <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>. Most, however, credit the recent era of islet
        transplantation research to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lacy</ENAMEX>'s studies dating back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three decades</TIMEX>. In
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lacy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> described a novel collagenase-based method (later modified by Dr.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camillo Ricordi</ENAMEX>, then working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lacy</ENAMEX>) to isolate islets, paving the way for future
        in vitro and in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">islet</ENAMEX> experiments [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Subsequent studies showed that transplanted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">islets</ENAMEX> could reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> and non-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">primates</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11</NUMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In
        a summary of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Workshop on Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation in Diabetes</ENAMEX>, Lacy
        commented on the feasibility of ‚Äúislet cell transplantation as a therapeutic approach [for]
        the possible prevention of the complications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> in man‚Äù [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Improvements in
        isolation techniques and immunosuppressive regimens ushered in the first human islet
        transplantation clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX>. Yet despite continued procedural
        improvements, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 10%</NUMEX> of islet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX> achieved euglycemia
        (normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Shapiro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> published a report
        describing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who achieved euglycemia following islet
        transplantation using a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX>-free protocol and large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor islets</ENAMEX>, since
        referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edmonton</ENAMEX> protocol [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. This protocol has been adapted by islet
        transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> around the world and has greatly increased islet transplant success.
      
      
        Current Limitations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islet Transplantation</ENAMEX>
        While significant progress has been made in the islet transplantation field [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], many
        obstacles remain that currently preclude its widespread application. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the most
        important limitations are the currently inadequate means for preventing islet rejection,
        and the limited supply of islets for transplantation. Current immunosuppressive regimens
        are capable of preventing islet failure for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months to years</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> used in these
        treatments are expensive and may increase the risk for specific malignancies and
        opportunistic infections. In addition, and somewhat ironically, the most commonly used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> (like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>, calcineurin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, and rapamycin) are also known to impair
        normal islet function and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> action. Further, like all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have
        other associated toxicities, with side effects such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oral ulcers</ENAMEX>, peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">edema</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anemia</ENAMEX>, weight loss, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, hyperlipidemia, diarrhea, and fatigue [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Perhaps of
        greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> is the harmful effect of certain widely
        employed immunosuppressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on renal function. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, renal
        function is a crucial factor in determining long-term outcome, and calcineurin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        (tacrolimus and cyclosporin) are significantly nephrotoxic. Thus, while some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        a pancreas transplant tolerate the immunosuppressive agents well, and for such patients
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> nephropathy can gradually improve, in other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the net effect (decreased
        risk due to the improved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood glucose</ENAMEX> control, increased risk from the immunosuppressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>) may worsen kidney function. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ojo et al.</ENAMEX> have published an analysis
        indicating that among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving other-than-kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allografts</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì21%</NUMEX> end up with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">renal failure</ENAMEX> as a result of the transplant and/or subsequent immunosuppression [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        Looked at another way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with heart, liver, lung, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney failure</ENAMEX> have a dismal
        prognosis for survival, so the toxicity associated with immunosuppression is warranted (the
        benefits of graft survival outweigh the risks associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>). But for the
        subset of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and preserved kidney function, even those with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">long-standing</ENAMEX> and difficult-to-control disease, the prognosis for survival is comparatively
        much better. In addition to the immunosuppressive toxicities, other risks are associated
        with the islet transplant procedure itself, including intra-abdominal hemorrhage following
        the transplant, and portal vein thromboses. The fact that there is already a good
        alternative to islet transplantation (i.e., the modern intensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> regimen) forces us
        to regard any newer, riskier interventions with a critical eye.
        Like all transplantation therapies, islet transplantation is also handicapped by the
        limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> pool. The numbers are striking; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor pancreata</ENAMEX> are available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. To circumvent this organ
        shortage problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> continue to look for ways to grow islets‚Äîor at least cells
        capable of physiologically regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin secretion‚Äîin vitro</ENAMEX>, but currently only islets
        from cadaveric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> can be used to restore euglycemia. Further exacerbating the problem
        (and unlike kidney, liver, and heart transplants, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> is needed for each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recipient</ENAMEX>) most islet transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> require islets from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> to achieve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euglycemia</ENAMEX>. Lastly, the current methods for islet isolation need improvement, since only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of attempted isolations produce transplant-ready islets.
        While islet transplantation research has made important progress and the success stories
        are encouraging, the long-term safety and efficacy of the procedure remain unclear. Other
        concerns relating to the field include questions about the impact of having
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-producing foreign cells within the hepatic parenchyma, the long-term consequences
        of elevated portal pressures resulting from the islet infusion, and the fact that islet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> can be sensitized against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>, making it more difficult to find a
        suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> should another life-saving transplant be required in the future. Also, very
        few islet transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> have remained euglycemic without the use of any exogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> post-transplant. Thus, while most islet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> achieve better
        glycemia control and suffer less serious <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX>, islet transplantation continues to
        fall short of the definitive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> cure.
      
      
        Is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Islet Transplantation Ready for Widespread Use</ENAMEX>?
        While no one suggests that the therapy is ready for widespread clinical application,
        another way of highlighting current problems is to focus on cost. Assuming present hurdles
        were cleared, islet transplantation costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $150,000</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> per
        transplant. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> dealing with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX>, it would cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $100</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billion</NUMEX> to give each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> a single islet transplant, with little assurance as yet of any
        long-term benefit. In contrast, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> direct cost of a proven therapy like intensive
        insulin treatment is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $3,500</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        The limitations of islet transplantation force us to recognize that the therapy remains
        experimental, and that many questions must be answered before it is incorporated into
        general clinical practice. At the present time, we urge a focus on the selection of only
        those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for whom this procedure offers the greatest likelihood of benefit. Most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> can, with diligence and perseverance, implement an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> regimen
        that maintains tight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> control while avoiding dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypoglycemia</ENAMEX>. However, there
        are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who continue to have tremendous difficulty managing their disease despite
        optimal care and effort. Even the statement ‚Äúdespite optimal care and effort‚Äù is difficult
        to define, and we advocate that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> being considered for an islet transplant first
        be referred for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> to specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that are committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> care.
        Since such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> is the most difficult to control have a poor quality of
        life, islet transplantation offers potential benefit. Even a low baseline level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>
        production by the transplanted islets may lower the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> required, while
        reducing the number and severity of hypoglycemic events. We also believe the islet
        transplant risk-benefit ratio is favorable for those with both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T1DM</ENAMEX> and kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">failure</ENAMEX> who
        are listed for a life-preserving kidney transplant; such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will have to take
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunosuppressive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> after transplant to preserve the kidney allograft function, so the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">islets</ENAMEX> can be added without too much additional risk.
        Where do we go from here? Just as early studies showed islet transplantation's promise,
        research must now overcome the hurdles revealed by the recent islet transplant experience.
        New immunomodulatory agents offer the greatest hope of revolutionizing the field. New drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">regimens</ENAMEX> capable of inducing tolerance to the transplanted islets would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> to
        maintain their grafts without general immunosuppression and its associated toxicities.
        While many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> are currently under investigation, none are ready for clinical use. We
        advocate that such immunomodulatory approaches be tested <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in controlled models where
        the results can be appropriately attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> itself.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century ago</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1DM</TIMEX> was invariably a fatal disease. With the advent of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, the prognosis changed overnight, and we have continued to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> improvements in
        diabetes care and outcomes. Pancreatic islet transplant has offered renewed hope to many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, who envision a life free of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> checks and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> injections.
        Some transplanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have enjoyed ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and are pleased with their decisions;
        unfortunately these results are not universal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> must continue to look for ways
        to improve the procedure while protecting the welfare of each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. The field
        has come a long way, but we must remain cautious, as we are treating a non-fatal disease
        for which there is a very effective standard therapy.
