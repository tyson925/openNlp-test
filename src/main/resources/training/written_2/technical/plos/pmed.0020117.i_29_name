        resistance are becoming increasingly important in the clinical management of patients
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. Of all the different virus subtypes (A, B, C, D, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, H, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>) and a
        rapidly increasing number of established and emerging recombinant viruses, it is subtype B
        that predominates in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and the rest of the industrialized
        world. Antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were developed by studying subtype B, and most data on the
        genetic mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> are also from subtype B. However, worldwide,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtype B</ENAMEX> is in the minority (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, for example,
        where there is broad viral diversity, there is a greater spread of subtypes, with subtype C
        being the most common, representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of all infections. Although it seems that
        current drugs—developed against subtype B virus—are active against non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B virus, one
        critical issue is whether viruses from some subtypes or particular regions are more likely
        than others to develop resistance against certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Another crucial issue is to
        identify the mutations that confer drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in non-B subtypes. Answering these
        questions might determine whether initial treatment strategies should be different for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B viruses, and also could help decide how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B virus who fail antiretroviral therapy should be managed.
        In a paper in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rami Kantor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> from a worldwide collaboration
        have looked at the mutations found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,686</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B HIV-1 infections
        compared with those in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,769</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with subtype B infections. They wanted to answer two
        questions: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, whether the mutations that cause drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subtype</TIMEX> B viruses
        also develop in non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B viruses exposed to antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, whether
        novel mutations (i.e., not previously seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subtype</TIMEX> B virus) develop in non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> when they fail to respond to antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. What they found was that all of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> drug-resistance mutations that have been known to occur in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subtype</TIMEX> B also occurred
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B isolate, and most of these mutations were also statistically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with antiretroviral treatment in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> non-B subtype. Conversely, of the
        67 mutations associated with antiretroviral therapy in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> non-B subtype, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> were
        also associated with antiretroviral therapy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subtype</TIMEX> B isolates.
        So it appears that few novel mutations are arising in non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subtype</NUMEX>-B viruses exposed to
        the current antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and that the present focus on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subtype</TIMEX> B mutations for
        global surveillance and genotypic assessments of drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is a reasonable approach.
        However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> emphasize that differences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and patterns of
        drug-resistance mutations are likely to differ between the subtypes, and that larger
        numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and further analyses are needed to exclude the possibility of new and/or
        rare subtype-specific mutations.
