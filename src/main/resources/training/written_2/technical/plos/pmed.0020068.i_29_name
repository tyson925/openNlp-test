        Regular physical activity has been recognized to confer health benefits since antiquity
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. However, for most of humankind, voluntary discretion over whether or not to exercise
        is a recent phenomenon limited to advanced industrialized societies.
        A large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of epidemiological literature consistently documents greater longevity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who are physically active on a near-daily basis, and reveals inverse relationships
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> exercise and incidence of major chronic disorders such as obesity
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], hypertension [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, and all causes of mortality
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12</NUMEX>]. From a public health perspective, there is little question that even
        modest increases in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> activities such as walking or stair climbing would have important
        positive consequences in reducing the burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>.
        However, knowledge of the likely health benefits accruing to the physically active so
        far has not been a sufficient stimulus to promote sustained changes in behavior for most of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. If education and public policies are insufficient to promote
        behavioral changes to increase physical activity among most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, can advances in
        biotechnology confer such benefits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> unable or unwilling to perform the
        necessary physical effort?
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Translating Knowledge of Exercise Biology to Novel</ENAMEX> Therapeutics
        Greater knowledge of how cells and tissues are modified in response to recurring bouts
        of exercise provides a basis for more precise recommendations as to the mode, intensity,
        and amount of exercise required to produce specific health benefits (e.g., treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dyslipidemia</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], control of body weight [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], or prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]). In
        addition, an understanding of the molecular signaling events that drive the beneficial
        effects of exercise on human physiology could foster the development of novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX>, or biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> designed to substitute for exercise.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who otherwise would develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> would
        benefit if advances in exercise biology revealed novel measures to promote the favorable
        effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, lipoprotein metabolism, and blood pressure that are known
        to accrue through regular physical activity.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiological Properties of Skeletal Muscle</ENAMEX>
        What do we know about basic muscle and exercise biology? The cells that constitute our
        skeletal muscles are called myofibers‚Äîlarge multinucleated cells that may extend for the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> length of individual muscles. There are different types of myofibers, which vary in
        size and with respect to metabolic and contractile capability [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Skeletal
        myofibers are innervated by motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> that contact each myofiber, and the intensity,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX>, and timing of each muscle contraction are determined by the pattern of motor
        neuron firing. A pattern of occasional intense contractions separated by longer periods of
        rest is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúphasic</ENAMEX>,‚Äù while a pattern characterized by brief contractions occurring
        repeatedly over an extended period is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äútonic</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Endurance</ENAMEX> training regimens like
        running or cycling employ tonic patterns of contractile work, and it is this form of
        habitual activity that serves best to reduce risk for obesity, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Muscle Mass</ENAMEX>
        Maintenance of normal muscle mass requires some minimal level of ongoing work activity,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and maintaining muscle mass is most effectively done through phasic
        contractions. A slow but inexorable loss of muscle mass is a feature of advancing age in
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Loss of muscle mass and strength is an important determinant of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> and disability in the elderly, but even rigorous weight training programs cannot
        completely counteract this age-related decline that becomes particularly troublesome in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eighth</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of life. Efforts to develop effective countermeasures to maintain
        muscle mass in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> constitute an active and important area of current research
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,19,20</NUMEX>].
        Although the molecular signaling mechanisms that transduce the effects of phasic
        patterns of work activity to modify muscle mass are incompletely understood, recent
        evidence implicates pathways that include the signaling molecules PI3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akt</ENAMEX>, mTOR,
        S6K, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX>, the ubiquitin ligases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAFbx</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MuRF1</ENAMEX>, and transcription factors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FOX</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> in the control of both catabolic and anabolic processes [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21,22,23,24</NUMEX>].
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contractile</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metabolic Properties</ENAMEX>
        With respect to variations in contractile and metabolic properties, myofibers are
        classified on a spectrum between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extremes on the basis of contractile (fast versus
        slow) and metabolic (glycolytic versus oxidative) properties. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> extreme, the fastest
        glycolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> have high levels of enzymes that generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> via glycolysis but few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1%</NUMEX> of cell volume). At the other end of the spectrum, slow
        oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> generate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> with slower kinetics but are capable of long periods of
        repeated contraction without fatigue. They are rich in mitochondria (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì10%</NUMEX> of cell
        volume). Other myofibers, called fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">oxidative</ENAMEX>, are both relatively fast and resistant to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fatigue</ENAMEX>, and are rich in mitochondria (like the slow oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>). Muscles composed
        primarily of fast glycolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are needed for rapid movements (e.g., escape from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predators</ENAMEX>) but fatigue when sustained periods of activity are required (e.g.,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX>).
        Most human muscles exhibit a mosaic pattern of different fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of variation among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, which is influenced at least in part by patterns
        of use. When we exercise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, or at least several times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>, we deliver a stimulus to
        the specific muscle groups involved in these activities that is sufficient to alter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> properties of myofibers within these muscles. While habitual physical activity
        promotes a great variety of physiological adaptations that alter vascular reactivity,
        cardiac function, adipocyte function, and neurophysiology, adaptive responses of skeletal
        myofibers confer at least some of the health benefits.
        Patterning of skeletal muscle fiber composition is initially determined during embryonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, but can be partially or completely overturned by stimuli applied to fully
        mature adult myofibers: by hormonal influences (e.g., thyroid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>), but most
        importantly by different patterns of motor nerve activity and contractile work. Myofibers
        that experience phasic patterns of contractile work‚Äîbrief bursts of activity interspersed
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long</TIMEX> periods of inactivity‚Äîwill assume the fast glycolytic phenotype. Myofibers
        subjected to tonic patterns of work activity‚Äîsustained periods of repetitive contraction on
        a habitual basis‚Äîwill take on fast oxidative or slow oxidative properties. Under
        experimental conditions in laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, it is possible to transform muscles
        completely from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> myofiber phenotype to another in a reversible manner, solely by
        altering the pattern of neural stimulation. We know that having a high proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">oxidative</ENAMEX> muscle fibers conveys health benefits, and the possibility to control fiber
        composition through therapeutic intervention is promising.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Signaling Pathways</ENAMEX>
        At a cellular and molecular level, how does a fast glycolytic myofiber sense a tonic
        pattern of contractile activity and transduce that information to transform itself into a
        cell with fast oxidative or slow oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>? We know that such signals must be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduced</ENAMEX> to the nucleus, activating certain genes and suppressing others, for myofiber
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasticity</ENAMEX> to occur. We know the identities of some of the nuclear transcription factors
        that carry these signals, and of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that regulate the function of these
        transcription factors (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Quite a variety of intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> have been proposed to provide the proximate
        signals in exercising muscles to stimulate activity-dependent gene regulation. This
        discussion will focus on a signaling cascade mediated by calcineurin, a calcium-regulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phosphatase</ENAMEX> that signals to the nucleus via transcription factors of the nuclear
        factor of activated T cells (NFAT) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Upon receipt of the appropriate calcium signal,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calcineurin</ENAMEX> is activated and removes phosphate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX>, thereby permitting
        translocation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> binds <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and activates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> (in concert with other transcription factors) of relevant downstream target
        genes that encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> necessary for fast oxidative or slow oxidative myofiber
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcineurin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NFAT proteins</ENAMEX> are abundant in skeletal myofibers, and several lines of
        evidence support the viewpoint that the calcineurin‚ÄìNFAT pathway plays a role in mediating
        activity-dependent gene regulation in muscle
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39</NUMEX>]. For example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> genetically engineered
        to distinguish the inactive (cytoplasmic) from active (nuclear) forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> by means of a
        sensor, it is evident that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> is inactive in resting muscles, but activated by tonic
        patterns of muscle contraction (running or electrical stimulation of the motor nerve) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        Using other genetic manipulations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to produce in muscle a form of calcineurin that
        remains active even in the absence of calcium signals, myofibers are converted from fast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycolytic</ENAMEX> to fast oxidative or slow oxidative forms [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. And in muscles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        genetically engineered to lack calcineurin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type switching is impaired [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Cellular Memory
        Muscle contractions are initiated under the influence of the motor nerve by release of
        calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which triggers actin‚Äìmyosin crossbridge cycling
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Calcium released via ryanodine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> is completely sufficient to activate
        muscle contractions, and the effects are immediate (within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">milliseconds</TIMEX>). It is also
        sufficient to initiate calcineurin‚ÄìNFAT signaling to the nucleus, but cannot by itself
        sustain the signal in a manner necessary to promote myofiber remodeling [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Changes in
        gene expression evoked by neuromuscular activity are not immediate but require that the
        stimulus be sustained for an extended period (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes to hours</TIMEX>). Moreover, tonic
        stimulation of the motor nerve must be repeated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, or nearly so, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX> for
        the changes in myofiber properties to become fully manifest. We have characterized this
        requirement for repetition of the activity stimulus over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> as a form of ‚Äúcellular
        memory.‚Äù The effects of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th day</TIMEX> of exercise are not the same as the effects
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">myofiber</ENAMEX> somehow ‚Äúremembers‚Äù not only the pattern of activity it has
        experienced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but what has gone on over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding days</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, such that the
        changes in abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that control contractile function and metabolism accrue
        over time.
        To explain this cellular memory, we propose that, as the bursts of contractile activity
        are sustained over time (through a tonic pattern of neural stimulation), a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> source of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> is mobilized from outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and enters via a class of calcium channels
        that are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äústore-operated‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúnon-voltage-dependent</NUMEX>.‚Äù This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> source of calcium
        is not required for muscle contractions, but is required to sustain calcium-dependent
        signaling to the nucleus. Phasic patterns of contractile activity do not promote calcium
        entry via store-operated channels. Tonic patterns of activity, in contrast, would not only
        promote the mobilization of extracellular calcium but also increase the number of
        store-operated calcium channels with each bout of exercise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myofibers</ENAMEX> would thereby grow
        progressively more responsive to tonic activity. Consistent with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, we know that
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> running increases the expression of a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>-operated calcium channel called
        TRPC3. Moreover, increasing the abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TRPC3</ENAMEX> in cultured myotubes prolongs the period
        in which intracellular calcium is elevated following a depolarizing stimulus, sustains the
        transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor NFAT</ENAMEX> within the nucleus, and augments expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX>-dependent
        target genes [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        A great deal of additional research remains to be done before we have a comprehensive
        understanding of how habitual physical activity promotes changes in gene expression in
        skeletal muscles, and in turn improves fitness and reduces risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>,
        dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. However, studies of the relationships between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of calcium metabolism and calcium-regulated signaling pathways‚Äîas described
        here in a simplified manner with respect to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TRPC3</TIMEX>, calcineurin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX> proteins‚Äîare
        illustrative of progress in this field. Other notable findings point to additional
        signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMK</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p38MAPK</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMPK</ENAMEX>) and transcription factors (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGC-1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MEF2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ATF2</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX>) active in pathways that intersect with calcineurin‚ÄìNFAT signaling
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31,43,44,45,46,47,48</NUMEX>] (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). It is encouraging that some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        attractive targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery.
      
      
        Summary and Conclusions
        Long the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physiologists</ENAMEX> who have contributed valuable insights in past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, exercise science more recently has attracted the attention of molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biologists</ENAMEX>, who have recognized the biological interest and medical importance of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> also are beginning to take interest.
        This review has focused on adaptive responses of skeletal muscle to changing patterns of
        physical activity, and on the role of the calcium‚Äìcalcineurin‚ÄìNFAT signaling cascade in
        controlling gene expression in skeletal myofibers. Further advances in our understanding of
        signaling mechanisms that govern activity-dependent gene regulation in skeletal muscle
        could lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, gene therapy, or devices that can, at least in part, substitute for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> exercise. Although it is unlikely that such technologies would fully recapitulate
        exercise-induced adaptations that affect other tissues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, beneficial effects on
        work performance and whole-body metabolism have been demonstrated using gene transfer
        techniques to alter skeletal muscles in animal models. If it proves possible to drive
        similar effects in skeletal muscles in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the interventions capable of providing such
        effects would almost certainly find broad clinical application.
