        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), including habitual level of contractile activity (e.g., endurance exercise
        training), loading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (e.g., resistance exercise training), substrate availability
        (e.g., macronutrient supply), and the prevailing environmental conditions (e.g., thermal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>). This phenomenon of plasticity is common to all vertebrates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schiaffino</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Reggiani 1996</ENAMEX>). However, there exists a large variation in the magnitude of adaptability
        among species, and between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Such variability partly explains
        the marked differences in aspects of physical performance, such as endurance or strength,
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, as well as the relationship of skeletal muscle fiber type composition
        to certain chronic disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, including obesity and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance.
        In most mammals, skeletal muscle comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 55%</NUMEX> of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body mass</ENAMEX> and plays
        vital roles in locomotion, heat production during periods of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold stress</ENAMEX>, and overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, knowledge of the molecular and cellular events that regulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasticity</ENAMEX> can define the potential for adaptation in performance and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metabolism</ENAMEX>, as well as lead to the discovery of novel genes and pathways in common clinical
        disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is Skeletal Muscle Fiber Type Classified</ENAMEX>?
        Much of our early understanding of the plasticity of skeletal muscle has been derived
        from studies undertaken by exercise physiologists (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holloszy 1967).</ENAMEX> With the
        application of surgical techniques to exercise physiology in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergstrom</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Hultman 1966</ENAMEX>), it became possible to obtain biopsy samples <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(∼150 mg</NUMEX>) of human skeletal
        muscle, and by means of histological and biochemical analyses, specific morphological,
        contractile, and metabolic properties were identified. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anatomist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoine Ranvier</ENAMEX> had already observed that some muscles of the rabbit were redder in color,
        and contracted in a slower, more sustained manner, than paler muscles of the same animal.
        These early observations formed the basis of the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terminology</ENAMEX> of red and white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle fibers</ENAMEX>, which was subsequently found to be related to myoglobin (an iron-containing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen-transport protein</ENAMEX> in the red cells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>) content (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Needham 1926).</ENAMEX> Based upon
        histochemical staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Engel 1962</ENAMEX>), muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are now commonly distinguished as
        slow-twitch (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>), which stain dark or red, and fast-twitch (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>), which stain light or pale.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, a further subdivision of the FT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> is made (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kasier 1970</ENAMEX>), whereby
        the more aerobic (or oxidative) FT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> is designated FT
        a , and the more anaerobic (glycolytic) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> is termed FT
        b . Under aerobic conditions (sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> supply to the working
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">muscles</ENAMEX>), energy is produced without the production of lactate. Under anaerobic conditions
        (insufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> supply to the working muscles), energy is produced via the glycolytic
        pathway, which results in lactate accumulation and in turn limits anaerobic exercise. Thus,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle fibers</ENAMEX> can be classified in terms of contractile and metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> have different capacities to perform aerobic or anaerobic exercise,
        partly depending on their muscle fiber composition. In untrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, the
        proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST fibers</ENAMEX> in the 
        vastus lateralis muscle (the largest of the quadriceps muscles and the
        most commonly studied muscle in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>), is typically <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 55%</NUMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> being twice as common as FT
        b <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>). While marked differences in the metabolic
        potentials between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>
        a and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>
        b <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are observed in untrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the absolute level for the
        activities of oxidative and glycolytic enzymes in all fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> is large enough to
        accommodate substantial aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>). While there
        is a large degree of homogeneity within individual skeletal muscles from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delp</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Duan 1996</ENAMEX>), this is not the case for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>). The dramatic
        heterogeneity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type composition between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may explain their remarkable
        variation in exercise performance.
      
      
        Does <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Muscle Fiber Type Composition Influence Athletic Performance</ENAMEX>?
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX>, it was popular to determine the muscle fiber composition of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> from different sports events. These studies revealed that successful endurance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> have relatively more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST</ENAMEX> than FT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">musculature</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costill et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fink et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>). In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sprinters</ENAMEX> have muscles that are
        composed predominantly of FT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costill et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>). Accordingly, the belief that
        muscle fiber type can predict athletic success gained credibility. In particular, the
        notion that the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST fibers</ENAMEX> might be a factor governing success in endurance
        events was proposed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gollnick et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costill et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>).
        In this regard, the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fink et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) are important. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        determined the fiber composition from the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gastrocnemius</ENAMEX> muscle (the muscle of the calf of the leg) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> elite male
        long distance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> good (but not world-class) male long distance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        untrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite group</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> medal winners (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        record <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> at the time. Muscle from the elite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> contained a larger proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST fibers</ENAMEX> than either the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> or the untrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79.0% ± 3.5%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.8%</NUMEX> ±
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.9%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57.7% ± 2.5%</NUMEX> respectively; 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). The values found for several of the elite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> were the
        highest observed in human muscle (> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>). Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST fibers</ENAMEX> from the elite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX> larger than FT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), and both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX> and FT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were larger in the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>
        than in the untrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Because of the marked hypertrophy (bulk increase) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the elite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX>, the cross-sectional area composed of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> was greater
        than either the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> or the untrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82.9% ± 3.1%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.1% ± 2.6%</NUMEX>
        versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60.0% ± 2.7%</NUMEX> respectively; 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). When the data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> and good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">runners</ENAMEX> was combined,
        a positive correlation between the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST fibers</ENAMEX> and the best <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-mile</NUMEX> performance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> was noted (
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">−0.62</NUMEX>, 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>).
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type alone did not determine the performances of the elite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX>. For
        example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> with similar best times for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42.2 km marathon</NUMEX> distance
        (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 2 hr 18 min</TIMEX>) had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST muscle fibers</ENAMEX>. Subsequent work (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 1978</ENAMEX>) revealed that endurance running performance was better related to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maximal O</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 uptake</TIMEX> (VO
        2max ; 
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">−0.84</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">−0.87</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">−0.88</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-, 2-</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-mile</NUMEX> times, respectively).
        Indeed, while an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX>'s muscle fiber type is an important morphological component and is
        related to several contractile and metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), other physiological
        factors (e.g., VO
        2max , maximal cardiac output, and speed/power output at the lactate
        threshold) are more likely to determine the upper limits of endurance capacity (Coyle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stepto 2001).</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Do <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Alterations in Skeletal Muscle Fiber Type Contribute to Metabolic Disease</ENAMEX>?
        The close coupling between muscle fiber type and associated morphological, metabolic,
        and functional properties is not confined to athletic ability. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX> also
        correlates with the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST oxidative fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lillioja et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>). Specifically,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin-stimulated glucose</ENAMEX> transport is greater in skeletal muscle enriched with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ST</ENAMEX> muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Henriksen et al. 1990; Song et al. 1999; Daugaard et al. 2000</ENAMEX>), thus priming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>
        muscle for accelerated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose uptake</ENAMEX> and metabolism. A shift in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> distribution from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>
        to FT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> gives rise to altered activities of key oxidative and glycolytic enzymes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pette</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hofer 1980).</ENAMEX> Indeed, the ratio between glycolytic and oxidative enzyme
        activities in the skeletal muscle of non-insulin-dependent diabetic or obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is
        related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simoneau et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simoneau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelley 1997).</ENAMEX> Similarly,
        with ageing and physical inactivity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other conditions associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ST</ENAMEX>-toFT
        fiber-type transformation, oxidative capacity and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin sensitivity</ENAMEX>, are diminished (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papa</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genes That Define Skeletal Muscle Phenotype</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle fiber-type phenotype is regulated by several independent signaling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These include pathways involved with the Ras/mitogen-activated protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX> (MAPK) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murgia et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>), calcineurin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naya et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>),
        calcium/calmodulin-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), and the peroxisome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">proliferator γ coactivator 1</ENAMEX> (PGC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ras/MAPK</ENAMEX> signaling pathway
        links the motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> and signaling systems, coupling excitation and transcription
        regulation to promote the nerve-dependent induction of the slow program in regenerating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murgia et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Calcineurin, a Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ /calmodulin-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phosphatase</ENAMEX> implicated in nerve
        activity-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX>-type specification in skeletal muscle, directly controls the
        phosphorylation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the transcription factor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFAT</ENAMEX>, allowing for its translocation to
        the nucleus and leading to the activation of slow-type muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in cooperation with
        myocyte enhancer factor 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MEF2</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Serrano et al. 2001</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calcium-dependent</ENAMEX> Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ /calmodulin kinase activity is also upregulated by slow motor neuron
        activity, possibly because it amplifies the slow-type calcineurin-generated responses by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">promoting MEF2</ENAMEX> transactivator functions and enhancing oxidative capacity through
        stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
        PGC1-α, a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors important to the regulation
        of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondrial genes</ENAMEX> involved in oxidative metabolism, directly interacts
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MEF2</NUMEX> to synergistically activate selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ST</ENAMEX> muscle genes and also serves as a target
        for calcineurin signaling (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu et al. 2001).</ENAMEX> New data presented in this
        issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) reveals that a peroxisome
        proliferator-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor δ</ENAMEX> (PPARδ)-mediated transcriptional pathway is involved in
        the regulation of the skeletal musclefiber phenotype. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> that harbor an activated form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARd</ENAMEX> display an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">“endurance” phenotype</ENAMEX>, with a coordinated increase in oxidative enzymes
        and mitochondrial biogenesis and an increased proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST fibers</ENAMEX>. Thus—through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functional genomics—calcineurin</ENAMEX>, calmodulin-dependent kinase, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGC-1α</ENAMEX>, and activated PPARδ
        form the basis of a signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> that controls skeletal muscle fiber-type
        transformation and metabolic profiles that protect against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>.
        The transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism during intense work requires that
        several systems are rapidly activated to ensure a constant supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> for the working
        muscles. These include a switch from fat-based to carbohydrate-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX>, a
        redistribution of blood flow from nonworking to exercising muscles, and the removal of
        several of the byproducts of anaerobic metabolism, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lactic acid</ENAMEX>.
        Some of these responses are governed by transcriptional control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX> glycolytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. For example, skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">reprogramming</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ST glycolytic</ENAMEX> phenotype to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX> glycolytic phenotype involves the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Six1/Eya1</ENAMEX> complex, composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grifone et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α</ENAMEX> (HIF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1α</NUMEX>)
        has been identified as a master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> for the expression of genes involved in essential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoxic</ENAMEX> responses that maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> levels in cells. In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mason et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), a key role for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIF-1α</ENAMEX> in mediating
        exercise-induced gene regulatory responses of glycolytic enzymes is revealed. Ablation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIF-1α</ENAMEX> in skeletal muscle was associated with an increase in the activity of rate-limiting
        enzymes of the mitochondria, indicating that the citric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> cycle and increased fatty acid
        oxidation may be compensating for decreased flow through the glycolytic pathway in these

        With the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> still fresh on our minds, many will ask: Who has the right stuff
        to go the distance? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Athletes</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Shorter</ENAMEX> are clearly exceptional
        and represent an extreme in human skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Realistically</ENAMEX>, few of us can
        ever hope to run a marathon in world-class time. However, there may be cause for some
        optimism for the average mortal, since endurance exercise training in healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> leads
        to fiber-type specific increases in the abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PGC-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PPAR-α protein</ENAMEX> in skeletal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">muscle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russell et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). Moreover, functional genomics support the concept that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle remodeling to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ST phenotype</ENAMEX>, either through activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calcineurin</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARδ</ENAMEX>, can protect against the development of dietary-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryder et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al. 2003) and obesity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). The results of these studies have clinical
        relevance since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-resistant elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and offspring of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with type 2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX> have skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petersen et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Petersen et al. 2004</ENAMEX>). Clearly, further translational studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are required to
        test the hypothesis that increasing the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ST oxidative muscle fibers</ENAMEX> will
        overcome the mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic defects associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
