        buzzing in the ears that cannot be blocked out. Tinnitus may affect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 10%â€“15%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>; severe tinnitus is very debilitating (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>%â<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">€“2%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>). Previous work
        has shown that tinnitus has a neurophysiological basis, but precisely which parts of the
        brain and the auditory circuits are involved is not yet understood.
        The human ear is essentially a very sensitive vibration sensor, one that is able to
        receive the minute longitudinal vibrations in air that make up sound waves. It can detect
        sounds from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>) (very low pitch) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hz</ENAMEX> (very high pitch) but is
        particularly sensitive to sounds in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500â€“5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hzâ</ENAMEX>€”the so-called speech
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frequencies</ENAMEX>. However, the ear, and in particular the cochlea, or inner ear, can be damaged
        by exposure to excess noise, leading to permanent damage to the ear, i.e., deafness.
        Some studies in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have suggested that tinnitus and hearing loss
        may be related. These studies have found that neurons in regions of the auditory cortex
        that have been deprived of stimuli because of hearing loss change their receptive field and
        may develop enhanced spontaneous activity. Other studies, such as some involving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroimaging</ENAMEX> using positron emission tomography, have suggested that parts of the brain
        involved in attention and emotional regulation might be involved in the production of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tinnitus</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the key research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in tinnitus has been investigation of cortical activity,
        especially in animal models of tinnitus, but studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have been rare. Previous
        studies have identified temporal and frontal temporal changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> whose tinnitus
        is severely disabling; however, there have been no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> studies comparing abnormalities of
        ongoing, spontaneous neuronal activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with and without tinnitus.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Weisz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        chronic tinnitus and hearing loss and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with normal hearing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
        were asked to fill in a questionnaire about the impact of tinnitus on their lives and had
        their levels of tinnitus assessed.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s methods differed from previous work in that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> chose to examine the
        power spectrum of neuromagnetic oscillatory activity during rest, whereas previous studies
        had focused on measuring neurophysiological responses following sounds.
        Normally in awake and healthy subjects a certain rhythm of brain activity at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8â€“12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hzâ</ENAMEX>€”the
        so-called alpha rhythmâ€”is dominant. Finding enhanced slow-wave, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX>, activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><4</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX>) in awake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> is usually a sign of a dysfunctional neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, as these waves
        can be observed in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weisz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>'
        analysis of the frequency spectrum of recorded magnetic fields revealed that the energy in
        the alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was strongly reduced and that of the delta band enhanced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tinnitus</ENAMEX> compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with normal hearing. This pattern was particularly
        pronounced in the temporal regions, and overall the effects were stronger for the alpha
        than for the delta frequency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>.
        This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to show these changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> and alpha spontaneous cortical
        activity, say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. But they concede it is still unclear whether the enhancement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delta</ENAMEX> activity compared with alpha is the abnormal activity perceived as tinnitus. However,
        the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that show slow-wave activity during slow-wave sleep are also regions
        of low alpha activity supports the idea that changes in cortical activity might be mediated
        by sensory deprivation, in this case that partial hearing loss might be involved in
        producing tinnitus.
        Tinnitus-related distress as assessed by the questionnaire was strongly associated with
        this abnormal spontaneous activity, especially in the right temporal and left frontal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, thus pinpointing a possible tinnitus-related cortical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
        A limitation of this study was that the tinnitus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> also had high-frequency hearing
        loss, whereas the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> did not; the ideal control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> would have been patients
        with the same sort of hearing loss but no tinnitus.
        In discussing their findings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest that their study supports previous
        work indicating that the prefrontal cortex is a candidate region for integration of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensory</ENAMEX> and emotional aspects of tinnitus. Further studies should focus on frontal areas,
        which could allow identification of interactions and modulating influences that
        higher-order psychological processes (e.g., emotions and thoughts) may have on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of tinnitus in the auditory cortex.
