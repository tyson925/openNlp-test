        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , is a clear and cogent document describing how major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> development should move forward in a collaborative
        fashion [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. There is no doubt that this roadmap will be regarded as a useful instrument to
        bring greater cohesion and coordination to the field. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who championed this
        effort should be commended for providing a great service to the scientific community. It is
        an excellent start to a continuing dialogue of utmost importance.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenge</ENAMEX>
        Why is it that we still do not have a protective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 years</TIMEX> after its
        initial identification? Many possible explanations come to mind.
        In the natural course of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection, the virus wins <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of the time, showing that
        specific immunity in an infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is unable to completely clear the virus. We have
        also known for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a decade</TIMEX> that primary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV isolates</ENAMEX> are relatively resistant to antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neutralization</ENAMEX>, probably because of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúprotective shield‚Äù</ENAMEX> on the viral envelope
        glycoproteins, consisting of variable loop sequences and extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylations.
        Another explanation is the extreme plasticity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> that allows new viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variants</ENAMEX> to
        evade immune recognition in the same way that they escape from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Moreover,
        superinfection by a second viral strain has been documented in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who
        have already mounted immune responses to the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. Yet another problem is
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> has yet to uncover the correlates of immune protection in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX>. Lastly, proven vaccine approaches from the past have either failed (whole killed
        virus and subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>) or faced seemingly insurmountable regulatory hurdles (live
        attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>).
        Given these daunting obstacles, why have so many continued in the long struggle to
        develop an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>? The answer must lie, in part, in the noble cause at hand. Yet there
        are also some encouraging clinical and experimental observations (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Rare patients
        do control <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection spontaneously. Certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> remain virus-negative despite
        repeated exposures. That superinfection is not more commonly found supports the notion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> control. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Vaccine-mediated</ENAMEX> protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">simian immunodeficiency</ENAMEX> virus is indeed
        possible using live viruses attenuated by specific mutations or by pharmacological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission by sex in the
        natural setting is typically inefficient (and thus easier to block), unlike most
        experimental challenge systems employed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> studies to date. Collectively, these
        findings provide a ray of hope to push on.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise</ENAMEX>
        The scientific strategic plan of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise</ENAMEX> is spot-on in identifying the major
        roadblocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> development, as well as in establishing the key scientific
        priorities as we see them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. It rightly recommends the formation of a growing
        alliance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to foster a better collaborative spirit that could lead to, among
        other things, stronger political support and increased funding. The proposed greater
        coordination and management, sharing of information, technologies, and reagents, and
        harmonization of standards, assays, and approaches could only add to our overall
        efforts.
        One might ask, however, whether there are potential downsides to the plan. In the name
        of continuing this important dialogue, I would like to offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. Arguably,
        the reason for the lack of an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> today is rooted in the basic problems
        posed by the virus itself. What we need foremost are new scientific solutions, although a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prim</ENAMEX> and proper ‚Äúprocess and structure‚Äù in our approach will be helpful. The needed
        breakthroughs to develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> will likely emerge from the creativity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>
        doing fundamental research that is free of preconceived biases. It is my contention that
        great new ideas are as likely to come from curiosity-driven basic studies as from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>-oriented approach that is represented by the new proposal. Therefore, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise</ENAMEX> must safeguard against the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúgroup think‚Äù</ENAMEX> that is so
        pervasive in large collaborative endeavors of this nature. The views of a small number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, no matter how smart or accomplished, must not supersede the collective wisdom
        of the scientific community at large.
        No doubt important contributions will be made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> working outside of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise</ENAMEX>. Measures should be taken to ensure that their views and approaches, even if
        deemed unconventional, are not stifled by the newly established system. Likewise, their
        research support should not be compromised because the creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise</ENAMEX>
        concentrates the funding into the hands of a relatively small number of designated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>. To me this is a serious risk given the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúflat funding‚Äù</ENAMEX> at the National
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The Future
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the ‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global HIV/AIDS Vaccine Enterprise</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scientific Strategic Plan‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        have laid out a timely and insightful plan to address perhaps the greatest public-health
        need of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX>. This document and its later revisions will serve as useful
        guideposts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> vaccine development effort for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to come. To be successful in
        this mission, our research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> will ultimately need a specific ‚Äúscientific blueprint‚Äù
        for making an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. That day will come only after we get another shot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>,
        infusing us with new knowledge and know-how. Is there any doubt that we need to redouble
        our investment in basic research on the challenges posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>?
