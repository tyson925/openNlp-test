        yet been presented that plausibly accounts for all the data on statins, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>,
        amyloid-√ü <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A√ü</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX>. In our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], we present evidence that
        the isoprenoid pathway contributes to statin-activated shedding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APP</ENAMEX> ectodomain in
        cultured cells. We do not yet know which (if any) other ‚Äúcholesterol-related‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Äù Alzheimer</ENAMEX>
        phenomena are also attributable to modulation of isoprenoids, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rho</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ROCK</ENAMEX>.
        Previously, conventional wisdom held that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A√ü</ENAMEX> load and hypercholesterolemia were directly
        related, based on observations that high-fat diet aggravated amyloid pathology in
        plaque-forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>]. More recently, however, the formulation that statins act
        simply via cholesterol-lowering fails to account for several observations that cannot
        immediately be reconciled, either with the original ‚Äúdogma‚Äù or with each other.
        First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fagan et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] questioned the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> as the final common pathway
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">A√ü</ENAMEX> load specification, since, in their experiments, low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> per se apparently
        had no impact on brain A√ü load in plaque-forming transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Then, equally puzzling
        pharmacological data emerged. Atorvastatin was shown to lower brain amyloid load and A√ü
        levels, but brain cholesterol levels were unaffected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In an apparent
        complete contradiction with the original observations, now, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have been
        able to devise circumstances under which there is an inverse relationship between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A√ü</ENAMEX>, with low neuronal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A√ü</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], and vice
        versa [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. These newer observations are unexpected and extremely puzzling, and no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> explanation has yet emerged.
        For those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> seeking an update on this challenging area, we would direct your
        attention to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alzheimer Research Forum Web</ENAMEX> page
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alzforum</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/new/detailprint.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asp</ENAMEX>?<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">id=1135</ENAMEX>), where you will find an excellent
        review of the literature as well as a series of evaluations of how our data fit into
        existing scenarios and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, statins, cerebral amyloidosis, and the
        cognitive failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX>.
