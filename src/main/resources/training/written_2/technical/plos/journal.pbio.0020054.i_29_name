        government's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Fire Science Program</ENAMEX> (JFSP), he figures his computer provides fingertip
        reach to just about everybody who's anybody in wildfire research. This points to a primary
        need of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> worldwide in combating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX> of recurrent wildfires: tools and
        technology suited to the job. It's no small order in places as economically, socially, and
        ecologically varied as, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, which are among the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where wildfire creates the greatest havoc.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">More than 750,000 acres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">303,500 hectares</NUMEX>) were burned in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> alone
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s wildfires. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 season</TIMEX> was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s worst on record,
        destroying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.4 million acres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.4 million hectares</NUMEX>), more than double <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX>
        average. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer months</TIMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of 2002‚Äì2003</TIMEX> brought perhaps the worst
        drought in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> to the populous southeast and the biggest fire season for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX>.
        Mountain forests were extensively burned and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were lost. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> suffered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217,000</NUMEX> wildfires, a number that is almost certainly too low because remote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imaging</ENAMEX> cannot detect many fires under the forest canopy. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, wildfires that
        burned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> during <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1997‚Äì1998</NUMEX> were later estimated to have released the equivalent to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì40%</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> global carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> from fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX>, inflicting smoke-related
        ailments on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>.
        Where wildfire is concerned, the many differences between such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> can perhaps be
        pinned down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> essentials. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is whether a blaze occurs in temperate or tropical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forest</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> is developed or developing.
        ‚ÄúThe science can be rock solid, but it can only go so far before social, economic, and
        political pressures take over,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Clark</ENAMEX> says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúThat</ENAMEX>'s what a forest service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>'s job is,
        picking the best option based on all those considerations.‚Äù
        Unfortunately, having science-based options that are applicable to local conditions is
        largely a luxury for developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> there can choose to let a fire burn
        under hopefully contained conditions, a policy known in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúwildland fire
        use.‚Äù They can set experimental crown fires to study their effects, as was done recently
        in"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). And they can take preemptive measures, such as reducing fuel
        in the forest to lower fire hazard.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>-reduction methods are mechanical removal of combustible materials and
        controlled or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúprescribed‚Äù burning (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). During <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>,
        prescribed burns were encouraged in protected areas, but thinning was allowed only for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with trunks of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine inches</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22.8 cm</NUMEX>) in diameter or less. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>,
        prescribed burning remains a choice, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX>'s
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USDA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest Service</ENAMEX> policy is much more focused on mechanical means. The argument runs
        that there's been too much concern about removing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, when what counts most is the
        enhanced fire-resistance of the thinned habitat.
        Fire hazard reduction methods must be tailored to an understanding of fuel
        characteristics in a given area, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Peterson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest Service</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wildland Fire Sciences Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúThere</ENAMEX>'s no uniform way of doing
        it, partly because, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, we haven't given the management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> any quantitative
        guidelines.‚Äù Working with other ecologists, social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, he's
        currently producing just such guidelines for the dry interior forests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúOne thing we don't want to do is take choices out of the hands of field
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> working at the local level.‚Äù
      
      
        Forecasting <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tools: Models and Simulations</ENAMEX>
        For those choices to be meaningful, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> need reliable information on the risk of
        wildfire outbreaks and on the future behavior of existing fires. This requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and
        simulations that incorporate climatic conditions, particularly wind (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). At the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest Service</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Sciences Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missoula</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have created a
        ‚Äúgridded wind‚Äù tool based on the engineering discipline of computational fluid dynamics.
        The program maps wind speed and direction using a digital elevation model, which is a grid
        of elevation points <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every 30‚Äì100 feet</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9‚Äì30.5 meters</NUMEX>) over a terrain <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10‚Äì40 square miles</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25.9‚Äì103.6 square kilometers</NUMEX>) in size. This map forms the floor of a box extending up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> miles (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight kilometers</NUMEX>) high, which is subdivided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> or more cubes. Wind
        flow from either real observations or estimates can be entered into the software, and the
        layer of cubes nearest the grid floor is used to create surface wind maps at resolutions of
        every <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">109 yards</NUMEX>) or less. In contrast, the usual resolution of weather
        forecasts is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7.5 miles</NUMEX>), down to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 miles</NUMEX>) in some urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>.
        ‚ÄúTwo or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>, we couldn't have done this simulation on a single-processor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">laptop,‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, physical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bret Butler</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX> would have taken
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days</TIMEX>. Now we can do it in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.‚Äù
        The ability of these maps to show varying wind flow in valleys, at midslope and on
        ridgetops, is just the beginning. The next step is to feed these data into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that
        predict wildfire spread. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have coupled their gridded wind technology
        to a fire growth model and tested it against the actual spread of several wildfires,
        including in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX>. Maps of actual and predicted surface winds
        showed strong similarities, encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Butler</ENAMEX> to foresee an ideal scenario in which fire
        fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> enter wind flow data online or by telephone to a central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">base</ENAMEX> where gridded
        wind maps and fire growth simulations are generated within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, before operational
        decisions are made.
        Yet he admits that challenges remain, including the current inability of fire behavior
        simulation to account for diurnal winds in addition to cold front-driven flow. In
        mountainous terrain, for example, winds often move up<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-canyon in the morning</TIMEX> and down-canyon
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. Moreover, the effect of vegetation on wind is not yet included in such
        models.
        Those issues and others are being addressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> working on improvements to
        the regional weather forecasts of so-called mesoscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest Service</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain Research Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, meteorologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Zeller</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> are contributing calculations of biological processes to mesoscale weather
        models. Their algorithms not only can account for diurnal winds but can predict the effects
        on local weather when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetation</ENAMEX> takes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and releases water vapor. This
        process can produce different fluxes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> drawn into the canopy and water
        vapor coming out, depending largely on the type of vegetation and its canopy density.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeller's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has analyzed current mesoscale forecasts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX> and found
        that in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX>, they often are too hot in the high country and too cold in the plains.
        Water vapor estimates are too low in the mountains and too high in the plains, which Zeller
        thinks is because the models feed off soil moisture estimates, not off vegetation. In
        coupling his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s new biophysical interface to gridded wind and mesoscale forecast
        models, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeller</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúpoint</ENAMEX> forecasts‚Äù are being developed that can focus on a prescribed
        burn area or even a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wildfire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Species Diversity</ENAMEX>
        Fitting the appropriate mix of strategies to a given situation is an issue that has also
        received close attention in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>. After the bushfires of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2002‚Äì2003</NUMEX>, media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>
        called for increased ‚Äúhazard reduction burning‚Äù in national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, prompting ecologists
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to distribute a joint statement declaring that such a strategy would not
        further reduce bushfire risk, but would actually threaten biodiversity. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> species
        are often well-adapted to fire, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have learned that different fire
        regimes‚Äîmeaning the type of fire, its intensity, severity, extent, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, and
        frequency‚Äîfavor different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). In the southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, prescribed burns
        of high frequency and low intensity can alter the habitat in ways that therefore threaten
        survival of numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>.
        ‚ÄúA generic problem or conundrum seems to be that species which do not prosper under
        relatively frequent fires can be found in most fire-prone environments,‚Äù notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>
        Bradstock, principal research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New South Wales Department of Environment</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX>. He says it's very difficult to determine how human interventions in
        various habitats can foster the coexistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that have different fire regime
        requirements.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Suppression and Tropical Forests</ENAMEX>
        As tough as such questions are to answer in developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, they pale compared to
        the problems of tropical forest wildfire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        In these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, a destructive cycle of human behavior begins with land-clearing and
        burning for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">farming</TIMEX>, logging, mining, road-building, and other uses that open gaps in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rainforest</ENAMEX>'s canopy cover. This lets in sunlight and air, reducing the forest's ability to
        smother fire by trapping moisture, and it encourages the growth of smaller, more fire-prone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> wildfires that occur are bad, but successive ones can eventually
        transform tropical forest to scrub savanna (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Of course, the remaining forest is
        thereby broken into fragments that continue to suffer incursions at their edges, as the
        cycle continues.
        In a recent paper in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan State University Amazon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Cochrane</ENAMEX>
        pointed out that prescribed burning is ineffective in tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, because the
        collateral damage outweighs any benefits. Indeed, tools and technologies employed in
        temperate conditions can seldom be applied usefully to tropical forests without significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX>.
        ‚ÄúOne of the main issues in fire science is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has no capacity to develop new
        tools,‚Äù charges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernesto Alvarado</ENAMEX>, a research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>. He's been working for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Forest Service</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> on field studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mata Grosso</ENAMEX>, the southernmost state of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>. He says that fire prediction simulations developed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades ago</TIMEX> have not
        yet been replaced by ones that account for tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wildfire extremes</ENAMEX>, including either
        large-scale crown fires or surface fires, which often reach <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 10 centimeters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.9</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inches</ENAMEX>) in height and move slowly but can burn for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and kill many <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        Fire behavior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> don't work for tropical surface fires because the physics are
        different from those in temperate <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, he explains. A slow wind generated from the
        unburned forest blows toward the fire, forcing the small flames to advance against, rather
        than with, the wind. Another difference is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> is mostly leaf litter, not conifer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">needles</ENAMEX> or sticks.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alvarado</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> light experimental fires in clear-cuts to determine factors
        limiting ignition and spread. Such experimental work is rare in tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> and description still predominate. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> also monitors surface
        wildfires, measuring fire length, spread, and heat release.
        ‚ÄúWe're trying to find applications that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can use to control fires or to explain
        implications of fire policy,‚Äù he says. Most wildfires originate from deliberately set
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">burns</ENAMEX>. For example, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> still clear land by the ancient method of slash-and-burn,
        in which forest is chopped, left to dry, and then burned. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> are now banned by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> federal law from burning at the height of the dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July</TIMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mid-September</ENAMEX>. They cut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, but if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX> come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in September</TIMEX>, they can't burn
        after the ban ends and must wait until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next season</TIMEX>, with nowhere to grow their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> in
        the meantime. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvarado</ENAMEX> thinks a more flexible burning schedule is a solution.
        The challenge is to pass on technological understanding to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decision-makers</ENAMEX>. For example,
        even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranchers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mata Grosso</ENAMEX>'s economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> usually haven't heard of fire management
        techniques, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amazonian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Peres</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Anglia</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. Educational projects from nongovernmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have helped to turn
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> away from heavy reliance on slash-and-burn techniques, but fire suppression
        information remains to be distributed on the frontiers.
        ‚ÄúWhat we really need are very large areas of primary forest that effectively serve as
        fire breaks,‚Äù he says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX> plans have been made by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in
        collaboration with international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, but implementation remains a question,
        particularly given the high level of economic pressure from multinational resource
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> eager to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX>. Major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> through the jungle are also on the
        drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúDifferent categories of conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> can be gazetted on paper, but in
        practice they're a long way from working. Someone draws lines on a map high in an office in
        Brasilia, but when you go out to that place in the forest, no one knows it's a conservation
        zone.‚Äù
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fire Prevention: Developing the Technology</ENAMEX>
        Information transfer faces similar barriers in much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
        forestry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> discovered during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> project (now winding up) to create a
        computerized early warning tool for wildfire outbreaks. The program was instigated after
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1997‚Äì1998</NUMEX> fires created a regional haze hazard, largely because of peat deposits up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21.8 yards</NUMEX>) thick that had become susceptible to burning in swampy forests
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drained</ENAMEX> and cleared for development.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Brady</ENAMEX>, who managed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> project in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jakarta</ENAMEX>, points out that headmen in
        remote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are still likely to believe that wildfires start spontaneously, by
        grasses rubbing together or even by magic. A fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> whose doctorate is in tropical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forest peat dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> sees the project as a medium to strengthen regional fire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecology</ENAMEX> in general. ‚ÄúIn some ways, that's more important to me than the tool itself.‚Äù
        The tool is a variation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Danger Rating System</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and, with
        various permutations, in many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> system has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components, one
        for indexing fire weather and another predicting fire behavior. The weather component
        models moisture input and output in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> generically classed as fine, moderate, and heavy.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> grouped grasslands in the fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> category,
        fallen leaves and litter as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, and peat and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">woody materials</ENAMEX> as heavy. They spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> calibrating these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> to local weather conditions, examining moisture dynamics and
        performing ignition tests. In developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> are further specified in numerous
        classes for fire behavior prediction, but that requires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of field work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX>'s team
        concentrated instead on helping key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, especially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, to obtain and use the appropriate computing tools.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> doesn't expect immediate results in terms of reducing acreage burned. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúCanada</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> still have huge fire problems after working on it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>.‚Äù But he does hope
        for a change of thinking, away from a current fascination in the region with satellite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imaging of ‚Äúhot</ENAMEX> spots‚Äù where fires are likely to be occurring. Fire danger rating
        concentrates on where fires are most likely to begin. ‚ÄúIt allows you to add prevention into
        your management program.‚Äù
      
      
        Beyond Prevention
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúretention‚Äù is a conservation buzzword referring to strategies that, in
        a sense, go beyond prevention of problems. What ecologists hope to retain is biodiversity
        in the midst of changes that can't be stopped, and their methods are producing major
        repercussions throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The work is centered on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Floristic Region</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>'s southwestern tip. Almost <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90,000 square kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34,750 square miles</NUMEX>) in area,
        it's the world's smallest floral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>. A conservation plan was launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> that has
        drawn cooperation from tourism, mining, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> use, agricultural, and land use planning
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        The project has the ambitious goal of protecting not only the usual biodiversity
        patterns of conservation areas but also the spatial components of evolutionary processes
        that enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to adapt to potentially harmful changes. This entails a complex effort
        to determine which parts of developed and undeveloped lands are most necessary to such
        processes, including rivers, sand movement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX>, gradients from uplands to coastal
        lowlands, and major wilderness areas. University of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Elizabeth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">botanist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
        Cowling, one of the scheme's principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>, estimates that it might require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì70%</NUMEX>
        of the region's landscape.
        As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, fires are important to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX>'s biodiversity, but too-frequent burns
        are a problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cowling</ENAMEX> thinks that by consolidating mountainous megawilderness under the
        project's plan and protecting spatial transitions between fire-prone areas and those that
        resist fire, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> could move toward allowance of natural fire regimes. The current
        problem, he says, is that protected areas usually stop short of the transition to
        semidesert areas that are privately owned. When fire spreads from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to private land,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> often gets sued. Under the evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX> will sit on
        governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX>, and property that they contract for conservation will be tax-exempt.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape</ENAMEX> plan has attracted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> in support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> and other
        international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cowling</ENAMEX> regards that achievement as much less important than the
        progress made in gaining support from various interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúThe key issue is the extent
        to which you can get biodiversity concerns mainstreamed to other sectors,‚Äù he says. Threats
        to habitat retention, not least of which is wildfire, endanger every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s about
        making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> realize that biodiversity is the basis upon which all other things will
        succeed.‚Äù
