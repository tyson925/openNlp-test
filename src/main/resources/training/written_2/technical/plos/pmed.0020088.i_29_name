        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LoS Medicine</ENAMEX> was launched at a time of unprecedented concern about the
        influence of hidden competing interests on the medical literature. As a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, we had
        the opportunity to help create “the fully transparent world that is desirable” [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. What
        are we doing to promote transparency, and is our strategy going far enough?
        We ask all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> to declare any competing interests—financial, personal,
        and professional [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]—and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' declarations are included with all published articles. We
        reject articles when we believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' competing interests have compromised their
        work; for research articles, this means compromised in either the conduct of a study or its
        interpretation. When we are concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>' competing interests may prevent them
        from giving an unbiased assessment, we find alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. And, as recommended by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Committee of Medical Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], we decline to publish studies
        when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> controls the decision on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>.
        Our main strategy for managing competing interests is disclosure. Financial
        relationships between industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, and academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are widespread [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>],
        and disclosing these competing interests is a crucial step in helping to protect the public
        and the reputation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> . Disclosure also matters because there is increasing
        evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' competing interests have a strong influence on their conclusions.
        For example, review articles looking at the scientific evidence on the health effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">passive</ENAMEX> smoking have reached different conclusions; a study of these review articles found
        that the only factor associated with the conclusion that passive smoking was harmless was
        whether an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> was affiliated with the tobacco industry [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. A study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">159</NUMEX> randomized
        clinical trials found a significant association between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' financial competing
        interests and their favorable conclusions about an experimental intervention [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        We cannot rely entirely on peer review to detect bias in the conclusions of an article,
        because although peer review may help to uncover some types of bias, such as bias in the
        study design, it cannot detect other types, such as bias in the study's conduct. Because a
        competing interests statement accompanies every article published in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can take these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> into account when they
        assess a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> themselves. The reality is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are wary of competing interests. In
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> were randomly sent the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> with or without
        
          Financial relationships between industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, and academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are
          widespread.
        
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> having disclosed a financial competing interest [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> scored the
        paper with the competing interest significantly lower on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> measures: interest,
        importance, relevance, validity, and believability of the study.
        Our policy of asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> to disclose their competing interests is not, of course,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foolproof</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Science</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Interest</ENAMEX> recently examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX> articles in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 13</NUMEX> articles for which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> did not
        disclose relevant conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed according to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>' policies [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> compared the statement of competing interests
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on the health effects of secondhand smoke with internal tobacco
        industry documents describing financial ties between the industry and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> met the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMJ</ENAMEX> 's requirements for financial disclosure, the disclosure did not
        provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> with a full picture of the industry's long-standing involvement with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.
        Should we as journal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> be investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' ties for ourselves? We do not
        have the resources to do so, and agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> that “an elaborate policing
        operation is not feasible or necessarily desirable” [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. But in this particular case, say
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, a quick search of the tobacco documents that are freely available online
        (e.g., at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>legacy.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX>bat.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu</ENAMEX>) would have
        been revealing. Maybe we are heading towards an era when such searches become more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">common—perhaps</ENAMEX> initially by randomly selecting papers for investigation.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Science</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Editors</ENAMEX> retreat on competing interests, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> came
        up with a list of questions to think about when formulating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>'s competing interests
        policy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table S1</ENAMEX>). Some are straightforward. Should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> declare their own competing
        interests? We think so (and have declared ours at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plosjournals</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/perlserv/</ENAMEX>?request=get-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">static&name</ENAMEX>=<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>_interests).
        Others are more complex. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> discover that a published <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> failed to declare a
        significant competing interest, what should they do? Should they impose sanctions on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>? Should they publish a correction or even retract the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>?
        To help us answer such questions, and to advise us on individual cases for which we are
        concerned about competing interests or broader ethical questions, we have appointed an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table S2</ENAMEX>) has expertise in clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">editing</ENAMEX>, research, health policy, law, and bioethics, and includes a lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> meets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> to consider competing interests
        across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. We are taking this issue seriously, because we recognize that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> are seen as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gatekeepers</ENAMEX> of published research. We welcome your feedback on how
        we are doing at protecting the probity of our content.
