        its meaning derived literally from the propagation of the faith, the antithesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science's Enlightenment</ENAMEX> ideals. The old word somehow seems perfect for describing the new
        world of drug promotion and its growing use of the famous face. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catholic cardinals</ENAMEX>
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, many of the feted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st</TIMEX> are now engaged in spreading
        the word. Now, as then, the religion promises miraculous breakthroughs, wonder cures, and
        sometimes even eternal life. The difference is that this time around, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> are earning
        fat fees from the marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of giant pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. And if the
        latest revelations from industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX> are anything to go by, their hefty investments in
        celebrity selling are well worth it.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celebrity Selling</ENAMEX>
        The epicentre of this phenomenon is of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
        routinely hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> to attract attention to the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that
        go with them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX> famously paid presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hopeful</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> to promote awareness of
        erectile dysfunction as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sildenafil</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>) was hitting the market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyeth</ENAMEX> hired supermodel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauren Hutton</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hawk hormone</ENAMEX> replacement therapy and menopause. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSK</ENAMEX> contracted football
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">star Ricky Williams</ENAMEX> to sell social anxiety disorder, helping make paroxetine
        (Paxil)‚Äîbriefly‚Äîthe world's top-selling antidepressant. Even the dead are raising
        awareness, with the estate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Errol Flynn</ENAMEX> now enlisted to help promote cardiovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> as a household name [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>, living or dead, becomes integral to a drug
        marketing strategy that includes paid advertising and aggressive public relations campaigns
        that can produce media appearances on the likes of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oprah</ENAMEX> and 
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Today Show</ENAMEX> . According to celebrity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>'s remuneration
        package, though always confidential, can range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20,000 to $2 million</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄòA</ENAMEX> partnership between a celebrity and a brand has an intangible sort of magic‚Äô, writes
        a senior marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX>, in an extremely candid piece published recently in
        an industry trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that hired handsome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄòWest Wing‚Äô</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Lowe</ENAMEX> to help market an anti-infection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowe</ENAMEX> was reportedly paid
        more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX>, though there is speculation that part of the fee might flow
        to charity [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In her report, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osnat Benshoshan</ENAMEX> shares some thoughtful tips with
        her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> among the pharmaceutical marketing fraternity: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äòuse an A-list celebrity‚Äô; find a
        ‚Äònews-hook‚Äô that links the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> and your product; develop some simple messages; and
        make sure the celebrity delivers them at every appearance.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benshoshan</ENAMEX> then reveals why on-air talk-show appearances on ‚Äòtop-tier media venues‚Äô like
        
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Rosie Show</ENAMEX> can be better forums for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> than straight
        advertisements, which are governed by regulations. ‚ÄòThe great advantage over advertising is
        that the airtime is practically free, and there is no fair balance to worry about‚Äô she
        writes [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The downside with a media interview, she laments, is that compared to a
        scripted ad, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äòthe</ENAMEX> situation is less controllable. It can be tricky for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> to
        ensure that all product messages are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">delivered‚Ä¶</ENAMEX>.‚Äô Her other big tip for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> is to
        rate your prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄòQ score‚Äô</ENAMEX>, a measure of their likeability and
        recognisability with the public. Apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Lowe</ENAMEX>'s Q score was high with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> over
        fifty, a key target of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Amgen campaign</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Another recent report from within the industry draws on public opinion survey data to
        guide drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company marketers</ENAMEX> on the selection and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äòeffective use‚Äô</ENAMEX> of celebrity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokespersons</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. The survey was conducted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NexCura Inc.</ENAMEX>, in
        partnership with the trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> that published the study. The major findings echo the
        insights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> about credibility, and underline the importance of your
        star being perceived as generally trustworthy, and specifically knowledgeable about the
        condition on which they are hired to speak. Perhaps not surprisingly, the survey found that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> diagnosed as suffering chronic conditions were far more attentive to celebrity
        messages on health than the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>.
        The issue of credibility is important, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NexCura Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> point out, because
        ‚Äòthe credibility rating is used as a surrogate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbuying‚Äù behavior‚Äô‚Äîan</ENAMEX> intermediate
        measure of whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> can persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to request the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> from their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>. The survey found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> was still the most recognisable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity marketer</ENAMEX>
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skater</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Hamill‚</ENAMEX>Äîcurrently promoting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication rofecoxib</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vioxx</ENAMEX>)‚Äîtook the lead in the credibility stakes.
        Significantly though, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost three-quarters</NUMEX> of those surveyed were correctly able to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identify Bob Dole</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Viagra</ENAMEX>, despite the fact that the advertisements in which
        he appeared were ‚Äòunbranded‚Äô ads for erectile dysfunction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> concluded by
        recommending that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> choose a celebrity with personal experience of the target
        condition; choose someone trustworthy‚Äîperhaps a newsreader or sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX>; and choose
        someone who will promote a single cause or brand rather than multiple ones.
        Ironically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NexCura</ENAMEX> survey also found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> agreed with
        the proposition that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> were ‚Äòjust doing it for the money and can't be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trusted‚Äô.</ENAMEX>
      
      
        The Trouble with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celebrity Selling</ENAMEX>
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> problem here is that the public is often not even informed whether a celebrity
        is receiving money from a drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. In the case of TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Lowe</ENAMEX>, there was no
        mandated requirement for him to disclose his link with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX> when appearing on media shows
        watched by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX> familiar with the case, who did not
        want to be named, ‚Äòit depended if he remembered to say it, and whether he was asked‚Äô. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>'s failure to disclose relevant conflicts of interest when covering healthcare is well
        established [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. When 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frasier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelsey Grammer</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> were promoting irritable bowel
        syndrome on top-rating TV shows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> were speaking on behalf of an
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>. In fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s fee had flowed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSK</ENAMEX>, which was at that
        time preparing the market for alosetron (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotronex</ENAMEX>), a controversial new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that carried
        modest benefits and severe side effects, including possible death [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        Equally as serious is the lack of any formal requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> or media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> to
        spell out drug side effects along with benefits when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> are pushing products or
        conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauren Hutton</ENAMEX> can be quoted, in magazine articles read by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>,
        as saying, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄòMy No. 1</ENAMEX> secret is estrogen‚Äô without any need for her, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX>, to list
        the dangers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement therapy made by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. But perhaps most
        troubling is the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX>, with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> power, can help to fundamentally shift
        the public debate about major health problems.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles</ENAMEX>'s companion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camilla Parker Bowles</ENAMEX> takes no money from drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, she did choose to make an important public statement about the bone condition
        osteoporosis at an international conference funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> promoting a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> for the condition [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camilla</ENAMEX>'s call for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX> intervention and greater use of
        expensive tests and technologies for the primary prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoporosis</ENAMEX> drew on
        materials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, and was synchronised with simplistic
        industry marketing messages. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camilla</ENAMEX>'s high-profile intervention at a drug company
        sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX>, albeit unwittingly, helps keep the focus on biochemical causes of, and
        biochemical solutions to, the much wider public health problem of fractures. Moreover these
        simple marketing messages undermine the complexity of the cost-effectiveness arguments that
        are central to any rational debate about the equitable distribution of health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Other high-profile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> attending the same conference eagerly accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>
        money, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Richards</ENAMEX>, blatantly promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> during
        an interview on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Larry King Show</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days later</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Future of Celebrity Selling</ENAMEX>
        With pharmaceutical marketing, it is clear that nothing short of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> II-style
        reform is required, though there are already encouraging signs of change. Scientific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> are slowly disentangling themselves from unhealthy industry influence over what
        they publish, and public access to clinical trial data is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> a closer reality [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        However, a less distorted scientific record about healthcare products is meaningless
        without regulations on how important science is communicated to the public. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Celebrities</ENAMEX>
        paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äòraise awareness‚Äô</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, should be
        subject to the same rules as direct-to-consumer advertising, which would mean prohibition
        in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> and much more fulsome disclosure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> than is currently the
        case. At the very least, public disclosure of a product's risks and benefits, and the
        magnitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity</ENAMEX>'s fee, should be mandatory and routine. Let's see what that does
        to their Q rating.
