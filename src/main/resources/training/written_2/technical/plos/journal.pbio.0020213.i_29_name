        came to rest on a previously undescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> pathogen. From the initial identification of
        
        Phytophthora ramorum , it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than four years</TIMEX> to produce a
        draft sequence of its genome, one of the fastest-ever discovery-to-sequence stories for a
        complex pathogen. This achievement was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> initiative, facilitated by the
        injection of federal and state funding into 
        Phytophthora research. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is not alone in the battle
        against this genus. 
        Phytophthora species cause <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousands of millions of dollars</NUMEX> of
        damage to the world's commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crops</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>: they blight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>,
        devastate the lucrative soybean, and rot cacao, threatening the world's supply of chocolate
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). But for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophien Kamoun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associate Professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plant Pathology</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio State</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wooster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), these destructive organisms present an exciting
        opportunity. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 60</NUMEX> species of 
        Phytophthora , but so little is known about the genus, he says,
        that there are things about its species we didn't even know we didn't know. â€˜What I find
        really exciting,â€™ he says, â€˜is discovering these unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unknowns</ENAMEX>.â€™
        The most infamous of the 
        Phytophthora pathogens is the potato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">late blight</ENAMEX>, 
        P. infestans . It was this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> potato
        famine in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1840s</TIMEX>, which resulted in the death or displacement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>. Today, 
        P. infestans is estimated to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> and tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000,000,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in lost revenue. The story for the soybean pathogen 
        P. sojae is similar, causing loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than US$1,000,000,000</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX>. In addition to the direct economic impact of these pathogens,
        introduced 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> can cause severe damage to native <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>. The most
        recent 
        Phytophthora on the scene is 
        P. ramorum , which has caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">â€˜sudden oak deathâ€™</ENAMEX> (SOD) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens</NUMEX>
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX> across the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, is now present in at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and is threatening to take on the native <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> of the entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> continent. It is also lurking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, although apparently with less
        devastating consequences.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Machinery</ENAMEX>
        With this kind of impact, it's no surprise that money has poured into research on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> will channel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7,400,000</NUMEX> toward research into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX>. A major focus of this funding is genomics.
        Sequencing the genomes of several 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> will help clarify the phylogeny and evolution of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">enigmatic organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>) and improve methods of detection and identification.
        Ultimately, however, sequencing should reveal the molecular tricks that this genus uses to
        subvert the defences of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to come up with new ways to
        combat these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">troublesome organisms</ENAMEX>.
        The 
        P. infestans sequencing initiative, coordinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamoun</ENAMEX>, has
        recently completed a survey sequence of the genome that gives an initial understanding of
        how this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is structured. Perhaps most striking is its size. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜It</ENAMEX>'s a huge genome,â€™
        says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamoun</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 250 megabases</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>), it's about twice the size of the 
        Arabidopsis genome. His latest research, published in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> of
        Biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemistry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tian et al.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), describes a 
        P. infestans protease inhibitorâ€”extracellular protease inhibitor
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EPI1)â€”that</ENAMEX> could be one of a unique class of suppressor proteins that 
        Phytophthora deploy to infect and counteract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> defences. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX> seems to upregulate the 
        epi1 gene during colonisation of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. EPI1 inhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> apoplastic
        proteasesâ€”extracellular enzymes that are part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s defensive armoury that have
        evolved to prevent foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> entering cells.
        â€˜Based on its biological activity and expression pattern, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EPI1</TIMEX> may function as a disease
        effector molecule and may play an important role in 
        P. infestans colonisation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> apoplast,<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€™ Kamoun</ENAMEX> and his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> report (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tian et al. 2004).</ENAMEX> If further research confirms this function for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EPI1</TIMEX>,
        then it will become one of just a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pathogen</ENAMEX> molecules that have been shown to
        suppress host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> defenses. A search in sequence databases for matching motifs reveals
        just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> similar sequence in the entire bacterial and fungal kingdoms. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apicomplexans</ENAMEX> like 
        Toxoplasma gondii that transit through the mammalian digestive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tract</ENAMEX> also appear to secrete protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors allied</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EPI1</TIMEX>. This similarity suggests
        an analogy between plant apoplasts and mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">digestive tracts</ENAMEX>. Both environments are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> in proteases, but nevertheless are colonised by a variety of microbial pathogens. In
        the case of an apoplast, the pathogen is 
        P. infestans , whilst in the mammalian gut, it's 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> gondii â€”and although they are phylogenetically distant, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX> seem to have independently recruited similar secreted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to inhibit the
        defensive proteases produced by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, whilst 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> gondii <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> inhibit gut enzymes trypsin and
        chymotrypsin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EPI1</ENAMEX> does not, suggesting that coevolution between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and their
        target proteases may shape the specificity of these pathogenic enzymes.
        Armed with this new insight into the molecular cunning of 
        P. infestans , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamoun</ENAMEX> hopes that it will be possible to come up
        with ways of slowing disease progression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, it looks likely that protease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EPI1</ENAMEX> are present in other 
        Phytophthora <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. There are significant matches between the 
        epi1 gene sequence and motifs from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> other closely related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. So any methods of blocking the action of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protease inhibitors</ENAMEX> in 
        P. infestans might also work against other 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> . The protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamoun</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€˜unknown unknownsâ€™</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜It</ENAMEX>'s an example of something that we had absolutely no idea was in the
        genome,â€™ he says.
        Even more advanced than the 
        P. infestans genome project is an ongoing collaboration between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blacksburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Genome Project</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Walnut Creek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. The focus
        here is the soybean pathogen 
        P. sojae and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX> pathogen 
        P. ramorum , for which draft sequences are now complete
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jgi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doe</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/</ENAMEX>). The genomes are much smaller than that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">250-Mb</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. infestans â€”</ENAMEX>
        P. sojae is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> and 
        P. ramorum is just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>. This, in part, explains the
        comparative speed of these sequencing efforts. But another factor is undeniably the fear of
        the unknown 
        P. ramorum , which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> netted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginiaâ</ENAMEX>€“California
        initiative <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$3,800,000</NUMEX> in federal funding to describe its genome. Ultimately, however, the
        sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> species will help to inform on the sequence of other related species.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brett Tyler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Bioinformatics Institute</ENAMEX>, is focusing on
        the molecular tools used by 
        P. sojae to infect its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>. He agrees with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamoun</ENAMEX> that
        understanding this machinery is the way to devise new control measures that could give
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> the upper hand in the evolutionary arms <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> against their 
        Phytophthora pests. At present, most strategies to limit the
        damage caused by species like 
        P. infestans and 
        P. sojae rely on developing resistant cultivars by selective
        breeding of varieties with major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> genesâ€”single genes that can block a pathogen.
        However, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> seem able to find ways to overcome these efforts. â€˜
        P. infestans is absolutely notorious for its ability to
        genetically change in response to a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> gene,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX>. â€˜Typically major
        resistance genes in potato barely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last a single season</TIMEX>.â€™
        Things look better for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soybean</ENAMEX>. New <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cultivars</ENAMEX> containing major resistance genes show
        resilience to 
        P. sojae for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five to ten years</TIMEX>. However, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is
        starting to break down, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> are running out of major resistance genes with which
        to conjure new varieties. The alternative, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX>, is quantitative or multigenic
        resistance, which relies on getting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> to express several resistance genes at once,
        each of which makes a small contribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s overall resistance. It should be
        much harder for 
        P. sojae to evolve a new attack against this kind of robust
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defence</ENAMEX>. The search is also on for new genes that could be used to encourage quantitative
        resistance to host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. One particularly promising approach is to pit pathogen against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> to see which genes are switched on. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> should upregulate genes that defend it
        against infection and the pathogen should upregulate genes that it needs to attack. The
        discovery that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> produce proteases and that 
        Phytophthora have responded by secreting protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> to
        disable them is important if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">long-lasting solutions</ENAMEX> are to be found. â€˜We just need to find
        a way to introduce new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-degrading enzymes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that the pathogen doesn't
        know how to block,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX>. â€˜With these genomic tools we can really accelerate the pace
        at which we can evaluate different possible protective measures.â€™
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Epidemiology: Identifying the Culprit</ENAMEX>
        An additional benefit of the abundance of genetic information is that species
        identification is becoming increasingly sophisticated. At a glance, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> can be mistaken for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>, so <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> profiling of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolates</ENAMEX> is crucial if <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are to be identified correctly so
        that action appropriate to each infection can be taken. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matteo Garbelotto</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adjunct</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Forest Pathology</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), has spent a significant part of his working
        life tracking the spread of 
        P. ramorum , the 
        Phytophthora that has killed off vast tracts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Californian</ENAMEX> forest (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 2</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> analysis has been crucial to confirm suspected cases of 
        P. ramorum , and has now revealed that infections have reached
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. This spread is probably due to the movement of infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ornamentals</ENAMEX> like rhododendron (
        Rhododendron spp.) and viburnum (
        Viburnum spp.), which seem to act as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> for the pathogen.
        â€˜What we're seeing is a parallel to what has been happening throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where the
        infection has basically moved using the commercial routes of the ornamental plant
        industry,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™ Garbelotto</ENAMEX> says.
      
      
        P. ramorum in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
        
        P. ramorum does not appear to have the same devastating
        consequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as it does in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USâ</ENAMEX>€”at least not yet. It's not entirely clear why,
        but it could have something to do with the structure of the bark of different host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suggests Garbelotto</ENAMEX>. â€˜We normally see more infection where we have more corrugation, and
        that's because water accumulates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fissures â€¦</ENAMEX> where the zoospores have a chance to
        infect the bark.â€™ However, he notes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European beech</ENAMEX> (
        Fagus sylvatica ) appears to be extremely susceptible to 
        P. ramorum . â€˜If it reaches areas where there are a lot of
        beeches, it could potentially mirror what's happening in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,â€™ he warns.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, symptoms characteristic of 
        P. ramorum infection were first described on rhododendrons in
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. Once this was confirmed to be the same species as the pathogen
        responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> SOD, there was speculation that 
        P. ramorum had either been introduced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX> versa. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2002</TIMEX>, it emerged that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are of
        different mating typesâ<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">€”A1</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A2</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. The latest research from Garbelotto
        and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, due to be published in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycological Research</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivors et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), supports this
        interpretation, demonstrating that although they belong to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A1 and A2</TIMEX> are
        distinct lineages and have not exchanged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, a batch of
        isolates from infected camellias (
        Camellia spp.) and rhododendrons in a nursery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
        state showed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A1 and A2</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were living side by side. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜That</ENAMEX> was a big surprise
        for us,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€™</ENAMEX> recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garbelotto</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜We</ENAMEX> had no knowledge at that point that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> type could be present in the same nursery.â€™
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Threat of Recombination</ENAMEX>
        Hybridisation between different species of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> can produce a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with different properties
        from those of either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the best cases comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where a new 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phytophthora</ENAMEX> emerged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> that began to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">alder trees</ENAMEX> (
        Alnus spp.). Research carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> demonstrated that the alder 
        Phytophthora was a product of a hybridisation event between 
        P. cambivora and an unknown species similar to 
        P. fragariae , neither of which attacks <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alder</ENAMEX>.
        Given this propensity for 
        Phytophthora <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to hybridise and new phenotypes to emerge,
        there is legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> that sexual recombination <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the A1</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A2</NUMEX> mating types
        could produce something more devastating than either form. Within the controlled confines
        of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garbelotto</ENAMEX> has been exploring whether the two types of 
        P. ramorum can get it together. Initial findings are that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">oosporesâ€”the</ENAMEX> product of sexual recombinationâ€”are being produced, although most of them
        abort before they reach maturity. However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> progress further, and (microscopically, at
        least) look like they could be functional. â€˜They'll germinate,â€™ he predicts.
        The threat that hybridisation could create a novel strain with a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> range is
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK</ENAMEX> is also taking seriously. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2003</TIMEX>, an entirely new 
        Phytophthora was isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. Although
        the new speciesâ€”currently referred to as 
        Phytophthora taxon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C sp</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nov.</TIMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C)â€”</ENAMEX> appears to cause relatively mild damage to its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beech</ENAMEX> and rhododendron <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK's Department</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Rural Affairs</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEFRA</ENAMEX>) acknowledges that hybridisation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> . taxon C with 
        P. ramorum could have serious consequences. â€˜The potential for
        the pathogen to adapt further to its putative new environment intrinsically or via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridisation</ENAMEX> is not known,â€™ note the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEFRA</ENAMEX> report on the mystery species
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defra</ENAMEX>.gov.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/planth/pra/</ENAMEX>forest.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>). â€˜Long-distance spread could easily occur through
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> of infected stock of rhododendron or beech and possibly other (as yet unknown)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hosts</ENAMEX>,â€™ they warn.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEFRA</ENAMEX> is monitoring the situation closely (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, on the basis of a
        preliminary DNA analysis, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> . taxon C and 
        P. ramorum are only distantly related, making hybridisation
        unlikely, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Webber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pathology</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forestry Commission</ENAMEX>.
        The closest known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> is 
        P. boehmeriae , a pathogen that has been recorded on several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, and on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, suggesting
        possible origins for the newly described species. But, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webber</ENAMEX>, the sequence match
        between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> . taxon C and 
        P. boehmeriae is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 92%â</NUMEX>€”not especially close. Much more
        evidence is needed to build a strong case for the origin of this new 
        Phytophthora , she says.
      
      
        Origins
        Indeed, it has taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 150 years</TIMEX> to track down the geographical origin of the 
        P. infestans strain that caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> potato famine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beagle Ristaino of North Carolina State University</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raleigh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>)
        is due to publish in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycological Research</ENAMEX> an analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extracted from diseased
        potato <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> preserved from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> epidemic (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ristaino 2004).</ENAMEX>
        It had long been suspected that the famine was caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ib</ENAMEX> strain of 
        P. infestans , which is presumed to have originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ristaino</ENAMEX>'s molecular evidence spotlights the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ia</ENAMEX> strain and traces its probable
        roots to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andes</ENAMEX>. The infection could have found its way from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> via exports of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato seed</ENAMEX> on steamships, she speculates.
        This kind of forensic treatment is more than just interesting. Tracing a 
        Phytophthora <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to its site of origin could reveal what
        keeps them at bay in the areas where they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>, and might suggest new ways to manage
        them when they are introduced to a different ecosystem, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garbelotto: â€˜There</ENAMEX>'s a huge
        amount of information that can be learned from understanding where they're coming from.â€™ So
        where do pathogens like 
        P. ramorum originate? The best lead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garbelotto</ENAMEX> says, is the
        ease with which it infects rhododendron. These ornamentals are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, but there
        are only a few places where the climate would suit 
        P. ramorum . The most promising, he suggests, are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
        Himalayas, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> plateau, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunnan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. But these are big places, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garbelotto</ENAMEX> has plenty on his plate in his battle against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> SOD. â€˜I am not
        very hopeful that we'll ever be able to find out where it comes from,â€™ he says.
