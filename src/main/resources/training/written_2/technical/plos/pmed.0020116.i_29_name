        although to those who have had it, it leaves a great impression. The name <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue fever</ENAMEX> is
        derived from the Swahiliwords 
        Ki denga pepo (“it is a sudden overtaking by an evil spirit”), which
        gives an idea of the rapid onset of the disease. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus is carried by the
        mosquito 
        Aedes aegypti , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> often occurs as epidemics.
        Although the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> is a fairly benign acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">febrile syndrome</ENAMEX>, it may be very
        painful—hence the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> nickname, breakbone fever. The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> can also cause a much more
        serious illness known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue hemorrhagic fever</ENAMEX>, which can progress to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> shock
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main serotypes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue RNA virus; dengue hemorrhagic fever</ENAMEX>
        is more likely to occur during <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with preexisting active or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">passive</ENAMEX> (e.g., maternally acquired) immunity who are exposed to a different <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serotype</ENAMEX>. In contrast to classic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>, the hemorrhagic fever and shock syndromes are
        mostly diseases of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and, if untreated, have a mortality of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 50%</NUMEX>.
        Around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fifths of the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> are now at risk of the disease (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> estimate
        is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are infected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>). The number at risk will increase as
        population growth, urbanization, international travel, and climate change influence
        transmission of the disease. Understanding how all these factors interact is important in
        planning for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> outbreaks. However, the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> is not easily predictable,
        varying with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, and also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between years</TIMEX>. For example, although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> is most prevalent
        in the wet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue epidemics</ENAMEX> have also been associated with drought in some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Niño</ENAMEX> is the best known climatic event affecting climate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between years</TIMEX>, and
        some research already suggests that there is a relationship between the timing of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">epidemics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Niño</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Islands</ENAMEX> and in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        Previous research has uncovered traveling waves of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, but the cause of
        these has been obscure. In a paper in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine Bernard Cazelles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> looked at the details of
        the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue incidence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Niño</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>. Their results, based on
        complex mathematical analysis, do not provide easy answers for those who might want to plan
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue outbreaks</ENAMEX>, though they do go some way to helping to understand the complex
        interplay between the various factors. In essence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found that there was a
        significant association between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Niño</ENAMEX> oscillations, climate variables, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX>
        hemorrhagic fever incidence with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2- to 3-year</TIMEX> repeat, for both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> and the rest of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>. However this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was significant only for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1986–1992</TIMEX>, and
        outside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these years</TIMEX> factors other than climate were probably responsible for triggering the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease outbreaks</ENAMEX>.
