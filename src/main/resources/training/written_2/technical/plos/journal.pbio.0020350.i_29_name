        explanation for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> is that, since red is inconspicuous to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, it evolved to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prevent bees</ENAMEX> from depleting the nectar of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> without effecting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pollination</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> can see, and they actually visit red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. So why are most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> red? To help answer this question, we need to consider how the
        outcomes of foraging decisions are affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> live, and
        by the foraging options of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mystery</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> face a trade-off between attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollinators</ENAMEX> and remaining hidden from flower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX> (such as nectar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX> and seed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predators</ENAMEX>). Consequently, there is often strong
        selection pressure for highly specific communication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that can advertise the
        presence of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> to effective pollinators but not to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Many
        aspects of pollinator syndromes are best understood in these terms (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proctor et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>).
        For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that are pollinated by birds‚Äîbird flowers‚Äîproduce nectar at much
        higher rates than those pollinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stiles 1981).</ENAMEX> If a bee is attracted to such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flower</ENAMEX>, it might sometimes remove nectar and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> without providing an outcrossing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">service</ENAMEX> (i.e., bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> from a different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> of the same species) to the flower.
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> should advertise their presence to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, but not to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>. Following this line of reasoning, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Raven</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>) suggested more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> were predominantly red because ‚Äòred is the only color of
        the spectrum that is at once inconspicuous to most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> and also an excellent ‚Äúsignal‚Äù
        of a high caloric reward for birds‚Äô. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raven's</ENAMEX> interpretation of inconspicuousness was soon
        transformed into invisibility; it was assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> did not visit red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> because
        they couldn't detect them (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proctor et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogel 1996).</ENAMEX>
        However, this interpretation no longer holds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waser</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) have shown that
        red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are not actually invisible to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>. Indeed, typical bird <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> with no UV
        reflectance, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet gilia</ENAMEX> (
        Ipomopsis aggregata ) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet monkeyflower</ENAMEX> (
        Mimulus cardinalis ) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), are routinely visited and
        exploited by different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bee species</ENAMEX> (reviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waser 1997).</ENAMEX> Moreover, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> are extremely abundant, they can drive birds away from red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. 
        Echium wildpretii , an endemic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>, presents
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">entomophylous (‚Äòinsect-loving‚Äô</ENAMEX>) and an ornithophyllous (‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äòbird-loving‚Äô</NUMEX>) subspecies
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) that differ in flower colour: 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. wildpretii trichosiphon</ENAMEX> , endemic to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Palma Island</ENAMEX>, has
        entomophylous, pink <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, whereas 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. wildpretii wildpretii</ENAMEX> , endemic to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenerife Island</ENAMEX>, has
        ornithophyllous, red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, pollinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalist</ENAMEX> native <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. wildpretii wildpretii</ENAMEX> is pollinated predominantly by birds
        early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> until introduced honeybees (
        Apis mellifera , which have increased enormously in number
        because of apiculture) deplete the nectar and displace nectar-feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valido et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
        So if red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are not invisible to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, why are most bird-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> red?
        Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are particularly apt at detecting red objects (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Waser 1997</ENAMEX>)?
        Again, this is not strictly true. Although all birds detect red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> do
        have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination towards the
        long-wavelength (red) end of the spectrum (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stiles 1981</ENAMEX>), they can also respond to
        ultraviolet light, and there is no evidence that, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hummingbirds</ENAMEX> have greater
        spectral sensitivity or greater spectral discrimination ability in the red part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectrum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith 1979).</ENAMEX> Feeding experiments, where hummingbirds are given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nectar</ENAMEX> in artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of different colours, show no inherited colour preferences;
        hummingbirds have temporary preferences that can be modified by conditioning (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proctor et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 1996</ENAMEX>). So are there other clues as to how this mystery might be solved?
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Visual System of Bees</ENAMEX>
        One clue might come from the visual system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX> perceive light with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wavelength</ENAMEX> above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 600</NUMEX> nm as red (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imbert 1968).</ENAMEX> Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> have three
        types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">colour receptors</ENAMEX>, with sensitivity peaks at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">340, 430</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> nm (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chittka 1996</ENAMEX>),
        although a very few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bee species</ENAMEX> have sensitivity peaks at substantially longer wavelengths.
        For the majority, however, provided that the light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is sufficiently intense, red
        light (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to 650 nm</NUMEX>) will stimulate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">540</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nm</ENAMEX> receptor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waser 1997).</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bees</ENAMEX> will therefore perceive red objects. To discriminate red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> from their green
        background, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> must rely essentially on the difference between the intensity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> that flower and foliage generate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees' ‚Äògreen‚Äô</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">540 nm</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giurfa et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 1996</ENAMEX>). Therefore, depending on the relative intensity of the green and red <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> may or may not be able to discriminate between red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and green foliage (Chittka
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waser 1997).</ENAMEX>
        Because of the structure of their visual system, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> trained to feed at artificial red
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowers</ENAMEX> take longer to find their goals than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> trained to feed at other-coloured <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaethe et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). In a real environment, where red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> would be more camouflaged
        against the different shades and intensities of the green foliage, the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> to
        discriminate red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> should be further reduced.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colour Vision</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niche Partition</ENAMEX>
        The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> require more time to find red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> than other-coloured <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>,
        together with some results from optimal-foraging theory, outlined here, could unlock the
        mystery and explain the association between red coloration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird pollination</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        When different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, either from the same or different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, are forced to share
        some resources, any degree of specialization tends to result in habitat selection
        (Rosenzweig <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Possingham</ENAMEX>, developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äòhabitat selection‚Äô model</ENAMEX> that showed
        how <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two nectar</NUMEX>-feeding pollinator <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, which differed in their foraging efficiency,
        would forage on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Although an abstract model, we can use it to
        illustrate how <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> might interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> at different-coloured <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        Consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, and red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Let us
        assume that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> differ only in their colour, that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> patches of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowers</ENAMEX> (one of blue, the other of red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>), and that the density of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> is the
        same in both patches. (For a general analysis, with the same qualitative results, see
        Possingham <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.)
        The question is: how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> should forage at the red and blue patches so
        that their intake of nectar is maximised? The expected intake rate is the average amount of
        nectar obtained per flower (or standing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>) divided by the time it takes to find and
        exploit a flower. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are the same distance apart and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> can detect red and
        blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> equally well, then travel time is independent of flower colour. Under these
        circumstances, an ecological equilibrium, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> exploiting red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
        equally, would indicate that the amount of nectar available from both flower colours was
        identical.
        Now add a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, sufficiently few that their intake of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nectar</ENAMEX> is negligible. We know that the standing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> is the same at red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        However, we also know that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> require more time to find red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> than blue ones
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaethe et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>), so their intake rate of nectar will be higher at blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and
        they will all go to the blue patch.
        If we continue to add <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> one at a time to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, then sooner or later, the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> will no longer be sufficiently low for us to ignore their depleting effect
        on the nectar available. What will happen at that point? Will <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> now start visiting red
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowers</ENAMEX>? Not yet. For a bee to visit the red patch, the difference in standing crop between
        red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> would have to be large enough to compensate for the difference in
        detection time. Before that happens, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> will shift to the red patch. Indeed, since
        birds require the same time to detect red or blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> will move from the
        blue to the red patch as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> start to noticeably reduce the nectar available from
        the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Possingham</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> predicts, therefore, is that when the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> is large
        enough, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> will forage at the red patch. Only when the difference in standing crop
        between red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> is so large that it compensates for the reduced detectability
        of red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, will <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> start visiting the red patch.
        To conclude, there will be an association between red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds</ENAMEX> will
        exploit red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. In addition, depending on the relative
        abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> (and of red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>), either <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, but never
        both simultaneously, can also exploit the other flower type (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niche Partition</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evolution of Red Flowers</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Possingham</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) helps to explain the ecological association between flower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colour</ENAMEX> and pollinator type, provided that both flower colours and pollinator types are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">present‚Äîbut</ENAMEX> why did the red colouration of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> evolve in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? We
        believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can also help explain the evolution of red coloration in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        To understand the evolutionary process, consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are
        present, and where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flower species coexist</ENAMEX>. One flower type, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalist</ENAMEX> flower, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blue</ENAMEX> and is efficiently pollinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> alike. The blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky Mountain</ENAMEX>
        penstemon, 
        Penstemon strictus , provides a good example (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castellanos et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). The other flower type, or bird flower, is yellow and is efficiently pollinated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, but not by bees‚Äîthe red beardlip penstemon 
        P. barbatus provides an example of this type (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castellanos et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). If bee visits were costly for the ancestral bird <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, they would experience a
        selective pressure to become red. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bees</ENAMEX> could impose several costs on the ancestral bird
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>; for example, the number of hummingbird visits may depend on the amount of nectar
        available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        Throughout evolutionary history, there will be variability and heritability in flower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colour</ENAMEX> (as documented for 
        Mimulus by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradshaw et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>). Since both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and birds
        easily detect and efficiently pollinate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalist</ENAMEX> blue <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, there is no particular
        reason to expect that their colour will evolve in one direction or another. Things are
        otherwise for bird <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, which are more efficiently pollinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. For simplicity,
        consider that, at any given time, this bird flower comes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> shades of colour, one
        of them with a slightly longer wavelength (an orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">morph</ENAMEX>). On an ecological timescale,
        yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> will be visited mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> mainly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, being more efficiently pollinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, will therefore have higher fitness
        than yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and given enough time, there will be selection for bird <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> to
        become orange. In the absence of other costs, mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> with higher wavelengths (i.e.,
        becoming redder) can invade a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> so long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bird flowers</ENAMEX> continue
        to be visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> (unpublished data). So bird <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> will continue to shift their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colour</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> are completely excluded from the bird <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> or until further shifts
        deteriorate detectability by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>.
        This explanation for the evolution of red coloration in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> differs
        from the one proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raven</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>) in a key respect. In our view, the main point is not
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> fly over red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> without seeing them; it is not even that they are unable to
        exploit red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> efficiently in absolute terms. It is rather a question of relative
        efficiency that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> avoid red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are depleting their nectar; it
        would work just as well if <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> were colourblind and perceived red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> as badly as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of other colours. Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Possingham</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) is not incompatible with
        birds being more efficient than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> at exploiting red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and the results would be
        strengthened if, as has been suggested (Raven <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Waser 1997</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are
        better at detecting red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> than blue ones.
      
      
        Toward a Solution
        Comparable problems can be found in other plant‚Äìpollinator systems. For example, when
        several species of bumblebees coexist, resource partitioning normally doesn't follow
        colour, but is dependent on different parameters: the corolla length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and the
        proboscis length of the bee. Proboscis length affects the efficiency with which <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of
        different depth are exploited (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye 1980)</ENAMEX>; bumblebees with long proboscises
        preferentially exploit <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> with deep corollas, while bumblebees with short proboscises
        exploit shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich 1976).</ENAMEX> But a bumblebee with a long proboscis can also
        exploit shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and, to some extent, a bumblebee with a short proboscis can
        exploit deep <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, if corollas are not too deep (although they will still leave some
        nectar behind). Indeed, when one bumblebee type is experimentally removed, the other one is
        seen to exploit both deep and shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye 1978).</ENAMEX> The same, we believe, should
        happen with flower colour: the experimental removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> should lead to the systematic
        exploitation of red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>, at least when corolla tube <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> does not prevent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> from accessing the nectar.
        In fact, there is even no need to perform experimental bird removals, because plants
        provide us with a ready-made design: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> visit <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> searching for both nectar and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pollen</ENAMEX>, while most birds exploit only the nectar. Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> should readily collect pollen
        at red bird <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. There are numerous examples of this, although in most cases they are
        indirectly documented. For example, solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and syrphid and muscoid flies visit the
        red, hummingbird-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of 
        Ipomopsis aggregata to collect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> when hummingbirds visits
        are frequent, while bumblebee (
        Bombus appositus ) visits to collect nectar are only common when
        hummingbird visits are rare (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayfield et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). Outside the native range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, the same phenomenon can be observed: in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> gardens, the
        honeybee collects pollen from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aloe</ENAMEX> arborescens <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bees</ENAMEX> cannot access the nectar,
        concealed at the bottom of the corolla tube. This is opportunistically collected by birds
        such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sardinian</ENAMEX> warbler 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia</ENAMEX> melanocephala (unpublished data).
        Another comparison of interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> beetle-pollinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, which in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean region</ENAMEX> have open, bowl shapes and red coloration (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dafni et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>). 
        Amphicoma beetles are more efficient pollinators of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> than commonly occurring <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dafni et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>), so the red coloration of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowers</ENAMEX> might help to keep other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> (possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and flies) at bay. Indeed, other
        bowl-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of different colours (such as yellow, white, and purple, e.g., in the
        genera 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cistus</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helianthemum</ENAMEX> ) are commonly visited by pollen-collecting bees
        and bumblebees. A particularly interesting test case is provided by the corn poppy 
        Papaver rhoeas ; in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> region, it is
        pollinated by beetles and does not reflect in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dafni et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>), while in central
        and western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> it reflects in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daumer 1958) and</ENAMEX> is pollinated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>.
        Although refinements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Possingham</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, such as developing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX>-model version, or
        introducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stochasticity</ENAMEX> or several foraging constraints, might help us determine the
        extent to which we should expect resource partitioning along the colour dimension to take
        place, it is, in our view, far more pressing to determine the extent and conditions under
        which bees exploit red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> (i.e., through comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> vs. nectar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exploitation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> exclusion experiments, etc.), the detection time of red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> against
        a natural background, and the effect of flower colour and size on flight mode in the field.
        Only then will we be able to fully unravel the factors that solve this fascinating
        mystery.
