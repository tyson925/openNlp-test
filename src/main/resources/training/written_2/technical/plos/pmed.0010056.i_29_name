        sleeping sickness, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue fever</ENAMEX>, and leishmaniasis [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. While patent incentives and
        commercial pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have made <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> health care the envy of the world, the
        commercial model only works if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> can sell enough patented products to cover their
        research and development (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX>) costs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> fails in the developing world, where
        few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can afford to pay patented prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
        It is easy and correct to say that Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> could solve this problem by
        paying existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> to focus on cures for tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. But sadly, there does
        not appear to be enough political will for this to happen. In any case, grants and patent
        incentives were never designed with tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in mind.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> main kinds of proposals have been suggested for tackling the problem. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
        to ask sponsors‚Äîgovernments and charities‚Äîto subsidize developing-country purchases at a
        guaranteed price [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3,4</NUMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> involves charities creating nonprofit venture-capital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> (‚ÄúVirtual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmas‚Äù</ENAMEX>), which look for promising drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and then push drug
        development through contracts with corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. In this article, we discuss the
        limitations of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches and suggest a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, ‚Äúopen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>,‚Äù approach to drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical Diseases Initiative</ENAMEX> (TDI). We envisage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX> as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decentralized</ENAMEX>, Web-based, community-wide effort where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> could work together for a common cause (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tropicaldisease</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Why Open Source?
        The idea behind asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> to subsidize developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> purchases at a
        guaranteed price is that this will prop up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prices and restore incentives for
        developing new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3,4</NUMEX>]. In other words, it is a way of fixing the patent problem.
        However, subsidies have an important weakness: it is almost impossible to determine
        correctly how large the subsidy should be. In principle, the most cost-effective solution
        is to set a subsidy that just covers expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> costs. But how large is that? R&D
        costs are very poorly known, with the published estimates quoting uncertainties exceeding
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 to $500 million</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. If the subsidy is set too low, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> cannot cover their
        R&D costs and nothing will happen. Set the subsidy too high, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX>'s costs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skyrocket</ENAMEX>. To date, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> has tried to implement these proposals.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúVirtual Pharma‚</ENAMEX>Äù approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and philanthropies fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that
        identify and help support the most promising private and academic research. Examples
        include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for One World Health</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iowh</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), a not-for-profit pharmaceutical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> funded mainly through private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gates Foundation</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neglected Diseases Initiative</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dndi</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), a public sector not-for-profit organization
        designed to mobilize resources for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> on new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for neglected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharmas</ENAMEX> have clearly started to bear fruit, and are responsible for most
        candidate treatments for tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> currently under development. For example, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neglected Diseases Initiative</ENAMEX> has a portfolio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> projects spread out across
        the drug development <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> for the treatment of leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, Chagas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharmas</ENAMEX> face <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> important problems. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
        similar to the problem faced by subsidy proposals: guessing private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> costs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> needs to understand what a product costs in order to negotiate the best possible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">price‚Äîand</ENAMEX> guessing wrong is likely to be expensive. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharma</ENAMEX>'s development
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pipelines</ENAMEX> will run dry without more upstream research. Research has been particularly weak
        in exploiting genomic insights [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> research is badly underfunded.
        For this reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharma</ENAMEX> cannot succeed without rigid cost containment.
        We believe that a new, community-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical Disease Initiative</ENAMEX>, can
        help solve these problems. Its success would help keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharma</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R&D</ENAMEX> pipeline
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>. Furthermore, it would use open-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> licenses to keep its discoveries freely
        available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and‚Äîeventually‚Äîmanufacturers. As we explain below, well-designed
        open-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> licenses are the key to containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virtual Pharmas' R&D</ENAMEX> costs.
        While we expect the final choice of license to be made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, the guiding
        principle should be to pick whatever license lets developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> patients derive the
        most benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX>'s work. Possible choices are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        How It Works
        To date, open-source methods have made little headway beyond software [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. However,
        computing and computational biology are converging. In the same way that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> find
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bugs</ENAMEX> and write patches, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> look for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins (‚Äútargets‚Äù</ENAMEX>) and select chemicals
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(‚Äúdrug candidates‚Äù</ENAMEX>) that bind to them and affect their behavior in desirable ways. In both
        cases, research consists of finding and fixing tiny problems hidden in an ocean of
        code.
        What would open-source drug discovery look like? As with current software
        collaborations, we propose a Web site where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> use a variety of computer programs,
        databases, and computing hardware (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Individual pages would host tasks like
        searching for new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> targets, finding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> to attack known targets, and posting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from related chemistry and biology experiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Volunteers</ENAMEX> could use chat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and
        bulletin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> to announce discoveries and debate future research directions. Over time,
        the most dedicated and proficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> would become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX> would not have been feasible. The difference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is the vastly
        greater size and variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, biological, and medical databases; new software; and
        more powerful computers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> can now identify promising <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> targets and small
        sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, including good lead compounds, using computation alone. For example, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SARS protein</ENAMEX> similar to mRNA cap-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> methyltransferases‚Äîa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with available
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitors‚Äîwas</ENAMEX> recently identified by scanning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SARS</ENAMEX> genome against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of known structure [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. This discovery provides an important new target for future
        experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">validation</ENAMEX> and iterative lead optimization. More generally, existing projects
        such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical Disease Research Unit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) show that even relatively modest computing,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemistry</ENAMEX>, and biology resources can deliver compounds suitable for clinical trials [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        Increases in computing power and improved computational tools will make these methods even
        more powerful in the future.
        Just as they do today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharmas</ENAMEX> would choose the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. The difference
        is that open-source <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> could not be patented in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. This would not
        stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virtual Pharma</ENAMEX> from developing promising discoveries. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Nwaka</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Hale</ENAMEX>, personal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX> would be a great boost to the efforts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharmas</ENAMEX>,
        because it would help to contain the costs of discovering, developing, and manufacturing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Containment</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX> would contain costs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> important ways. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX> would ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> to
        donate their time (and any patentable discoveries) to the collaboration. Instead of
        financial incentives, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX> would offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> non-monetary rewards, such as ideological
        satisfaction, the acquisition of new skills, enhancement of professional reputation, and
        the ability to advertise one's skills to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>. Software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">collaborations</ENAMEX> have
        demonstrated that these incentives are a good way to attract and motivate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        Similar incentives should work equally well for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX>, and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we have already pointed out that existing proposals have difficulty containing
        costs. The root cause is patents. Normally, society relies on competition to keep prices
        low. Patents‚Äîby design‚Äîshort-circuit competition by giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> the legal right to
        prevent others from using (or even developing) their invention. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX>, on the other hand,
        would restore competition by making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> available to anyone who wanted to
        develop them. We expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> to exploit this advantage by signing development contracts
        with whichever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> offers the lowest bid. Such competitive bidding is a powerful way to
        contain costs, and is also a good way to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharma</ENAMEX> has extensive
        experience supervising contract research.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the absence of patents would continue to keep prices low once <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> reached the
        market. The generic drug industry shows what happens once <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> are allowed to
        compete. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> frequently fall to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX> their original price when patents
        expire [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intellectual Property Rights</ENAMEX>
        Would <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> really let their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people volunteer</ENAMEX>? Won't they insist
        on intellectual property rights? The practical answer is that sensible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> do not care
        about intellectual property rights unless they expect to earn a profit. This explains why
        sophisticated university licensing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> seldom bother to interfere with open-source
        software projects that are not commercially valuable [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The same logic would apply to
        open-source drug discovery. We would hope that life sciences <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> would make a similar
        calculation. But permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to participate is only the beginning. We think that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will also donate the data, research tools, and other resources
        needed to make TDI even stronger. The reason, once again, is that they have little to lose.
        The value of their intellectual property depends almost entirely on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. For this reason, it costs very little to share their information with tropical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. In fact, drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> already do this [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX>'s main challenge
        will be to show <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> that an open-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> project can keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from diverting donated
        information back into the commercially lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, there are precedents for private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> developing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> off patent. During
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1950s, March of Dimes</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marchofdimes</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>) developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polio vaccines</ENAMEX> without any
        patents at all [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. It then signed guaranteed purchase contracts with any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>
        willing to develop commercial-scale production methods. The incentive may not have been
        conventional, but it worked. And why not? The contracts made good business sense: contract
        profits may have been small compared to the profits on patented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, but so was the risk.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fifty years later</TIMEX>, contract research still makes sense. Generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, developing
        world <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, contract research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> have all said
        that they would consider contracts to develop open-source drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Spino</ENAMEX>, S.
        Sharma, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Hijek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Francis</ENAMEX>, personal communications).
      
      
        Next Steps
        So far, we have described a shoestring operation that exists mainly on the Web. Except
        for computer time, budgets would be more or less the same as existing software
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collaborations</ENAMEX>. Computing would be expensive but manageable. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> routinely
        scrounge resources from university machines or borrow time on home computers [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>]. This
        Web-centric approach would be a good start, but not a complete solution. Computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> works best when it can interact with experimental chemistry and biology.
        Nevertheless, a low-budget computational approach is probably enough to generate new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>, suggest ideas for follow-up experiments, and make new drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> available
        under licenses designed to yield maximum benefit to the developing world.
        In practice, an open-source drug discovery effort is likely to include modest
        experiments. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic scientists</ENAMEX> control discretionary resources and, in some cases,
        tropical disease grants. Furthermore, good science generates its own funding. We expect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">experimentalists</ENAMEX> to turn the collaboration's Web pages into grant proposals.
        That said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> will be most productive if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> back them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Charities</ENAMEX>
        could support open-source drug discovery by making wet chemistry and biology experiments a
        top priority. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Corporations</ENAMEX> could also help by donating funds, laboratory time, or
        previously unpublished results. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> low cost/high value option would be for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that
        have already tried a particular research direction to warn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDI</ENAMEX> if the collaboration was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> to investigate a known dead end. (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>, personal communication)
      
      
        Conclusion
        Open-source drug discovery is feasible‚Äîthat is, no known scientific or economic barrier
        bars the way. But what are the risks? Experience with software collaborations highlights
        the main social and economic challenges. First, the project will have to find and motivate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>. Based on existing software collaborations, we estimate a required minimum
        ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few dozen</NUMEX> active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, modest chemistry and biology
        experiments will be needed to increase the chances for success. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources</ENAMEX> of several
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> per year‚Äîmostly in the form of in-kind donations of databases,
        laboratory access, and computing time‚Äîwould make open-source drug discovery much more
        powerful. By most standards, such risks are real but acceptable.
        The largest uncertainties are scientific. Can a volunteer effort based on computational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> and modest experiments produce the high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Pharma</ENAMEX>
        needs? A successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> must (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) make a significant contribution toward supplying the
        genomic insights that tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> research needs to move forward, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) make useful
        drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> available for development and production under open-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> licenses.
        Open-source drug discovery looks feasible. The only way to be sure is to do the
        experiment‚Äîand we invite you to join us.
