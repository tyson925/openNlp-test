        this generation depends upon the quality of the education they receive. It is clear the
        expectations for undergraduate education are changing (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collins et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). When the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Research Council</ENAMEX> published its recommendations for changing the undergraduate
        training of future life <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the BIO2010</TIMEX> report, access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>-based research
        was a primary recommendation: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúColleges and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> should provide all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with
        opportunities to become engaged in research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Ä¶‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Research Council</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). As every
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">investigator</ENAMEX> knows, research begins in the literature, not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. Therefore, an
        unstated assumption of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the BIO2010</TIMEX> report was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> need to have unencumbered
        access to the research literature in order to engage in research and become scientific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>.
        Early in my teaching career, I discussed graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> preparation with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>. He said new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate students</ENAMEX> knew about the different methods, they could even
        recite fine definitions‚Äîbut if you asked them which method would be best to answer a
        particular question, they were uncertain. This reinforced my attitude towards teaching and
        testing. I realized that teaching science to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> should be modeled on the way all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> learn new information: in the context of an interesting question and on a
        need-to-know basis. This new style of teaching, ‚Äúapplied education,‚Äù would require me to
        reorganize reading materials for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, since most textbooks are written by someone who
        already knows all the information and has organized it accordingly. For example, describing
        membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> structure, and signal transduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapters 5, 12</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>,
        respectively (spanning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">227</NUMEX> pages) is not helpful for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. It makes more sense to
        cover these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> topics in close succession.
        Gradually, I converted all my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> over to this ‚Äúapplied education‚Äù format in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were learning new information the same way all other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> do. I began by
        asking questions that could be answered by learning the information provided by textbooks
        or the literature. With time, I realized that published research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> are ideal teaching
        tools because they cover information in the context of an interesting question and new
        material is presented as needed. This led me to collect series of related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> to create
        my own course materials (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/courses/Molbio/Publicschedule.</ENAMEX>html<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#anchor99574051</NUMEX>). So, for example,
        in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes students</ENAMEX> first read the elegant paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pelham</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>) that
        uncovered the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tetrapeptide lysine‚Äìaspartic acid‚Äìglutamic acid‚Äìleucine</ENAMEX> (KDEL) retention
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> destined to remain in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
        read <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> additional papers, one of which is composed of weak data and overinterpreted
        analysis. Through this series of papers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> learn to trust their own assessment of
        the data rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>': this is a very substantial improvement in student
        thinking and in their attitude towards the literature. I do not emphasize the particular
        details of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, but I do want the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to gain higher-order thinking skills.
        Therefore, my tests consist of figures from research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> have never
        seen before. They are asked to interpret the figures as they appear in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> and/or to
        design new experiments to answer a new question, given what they have learned from the
        published figure. Testing them in this way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> very quickly understand that
        memorizing details is not productive, but learning how to read scientific literature and
        design well-controlled experiments is much more rewarding (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/courses/Molbio/molecular.</ENAMEX>html<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2003exams</NUMEX>). Based on this success, I
        have designed my genomics course on the ‚Äúapplied education‚Äù principle (see below; see also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/genomics</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Changes Education</ENAMEX>
        When I was a graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PubMed</ENAMEX> was restricted
        to those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that could afford the subscription fee; now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> is freely
        available to all who have Internet access. This change in access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> has
        significantly improved undergraduate training by providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with the opportunities
        to do literature searches for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> reports, papers, seminars, and of course original
        research. Free access to information in the life sciences has continued to evolve with the
        newest phenomenon in publishing‚Äîopen-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PubMed</ENAMEX> Central
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pubmedcentral</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/</ENAMEX>) is a rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repository</ENAMEX> of and portal to open access
        articles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioMed Central</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomedcentral</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/</ENAMEX>) publishes a growing number of
        open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, and there are a few new open-access education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cell Biology Education</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cellbioed</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>) and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Undergraduate Neuroscience</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funjournal</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>). As the newest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in the open-access arena, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> has further enriched the growing espritdes-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> of
        publishing and has already improved undergraduate education. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> now have equal
        access to a growing portion of the literature that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> at
        wealthy institutions enjoy.
        Interestingly, the push towards open access has led many subscription-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">permit ‚Äúfree</ENAMEX> access‚Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to 12 months</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>. These time-delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>access
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> are helpful for course adjustments in the subsequent academic year, but not the
        current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">semester</TIMEX>. Unfortunately, owing to the high cost of subscriptions for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> at my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> (like many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>) is forced to make difficult
        choices about which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> we can afford. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> subscriptions goes down
        in proportion to the rise of subscription costs, but fortunately this loss is being offset
        by the creation of new open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Promise</ENAMEX> of the Internet
        I have been teaching undergraduates since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> and have noticed a trend in the way I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">teach‚Äîincreasingly</ENAMEX>, I have provided research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> so they can learn to
        read those papers and improve their critical thinking skills. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason for my increased
        use of research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> is the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDFs</ENAMEX>. When I first started using journal
        articles in my molecular biology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> had to meet in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> so we could
        pass around the bulky bound volumes to detect the important subtleties often lost in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photocopied</ENAMEX> versions of figures. Later, I learned how to scan the figures and generate Web
        pages so that I could project the images in class and so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> could print
        laser-quality versions of papers (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/molecular</ENAMEX>). Now I use PDF
        files for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to print and for me to display in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> with no loss of information due
        to reformatting or resolution problems (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        With my increased confidence from using research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> in my molecular biology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, I
        began experimenting with research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> for my introductory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">First-year students</ENAMEX>
        are not ready to critically evaluate complex data, but they are beginning their first
        forays into reading review articles and occasionally original research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. When
        introductory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> make presentations of their findings in laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>,
        increasing numbers are utilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDF</ENAMEX> reprints when they are available.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> have been reading primary research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> since well before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDF</ENAMEX> files became
        available, but the increased access to papers online and the improved quality of the format
        has significantly enhanced the use of research and review papers in the undergraduate
        curriculum. It is common for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in upper-level lecture and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab courses</ENAMEX> to read papers
        (DebBurman <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kitchen et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; Mulnix <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), and seminar
        courses are usually dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> presentations of literature (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> and Boggs
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; Hales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lom 2003).</ENAMEX>
        It is worth noting that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> are being told to reduce
        expenditures, and one frequent target of money-saving measures is the ever-increasing costs
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library journal</ENAMEX> subscriptions. This fiscal reality will erode the pedagogical gains made
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> who are already meeting one of the goals of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the BIO2010</TIMEX> report by immersing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in the research literature. However, open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> are proving to be
        virtual oases in a desert of pay-per-view <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> that are available on a sliding scale
        that favors the richest and biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open-Access Resources</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Teaching ‚Ä</ENAMEX>¶
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX>, I have taught an undergraduate course in genomics
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/genomics</ENAMEX>) in which I capitalize on a confluence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trends in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>: public domain databases and open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell 2003</ENAMEX>). In my genomics
        class, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> assignments for which they are required to mine databases for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX>, transcriptome, and proteome information (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/courses/genomics/2003/cain/</ENAMEX>home.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>). But genomics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> are not
        the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>, since other classes at many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> (e.g., introductory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX>, biochemistry, cell development, genetics, microbiology, molecular biology [see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/courses/Molbio/standardsHP.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">html#anchor78181983</ENAMEX>], and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroscience</ENAMEX>) require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to mine public domain databases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dyer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LeBlanc</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Honts 2003</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, we introduced genome database searching to our introductory biology
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/people/macampbell/Hope/DQ/DQ9.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/people/macampbell/Hope/DQ/DQ10.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">First-year students</ENAMEX> use Genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Browser</ENAMEX> and BLAST to determine the molecular causes of cystic fibrosis and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntington</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, respectively. The benefit of public databases and open-access literature to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> is obvious and immediate. Images can be used in lectures, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> can be
        distributed easily and on short notice for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> use. There is no need to worry about
        limited access due to subscription costs nor an obligation to obtain copyright permission
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>, which is a bothersome and sometimes expensive process for busy faculty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. By reducing nonproductive busy work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> have already
        created an environment that is improving undergraduate education <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with long-term
        benefits in creating research-ready graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> who are exposed to publicly available literature through their coursework often
        develop an expectation that all research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> will be freely available to them from any
        computer and become frustrated if they do not have access to all the journal articles they
        want and need to read. Increasingly, I have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> sending me <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDF</ENAMEX> files of open-access
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> articles they have read and want to share with me. Who would have guessed that free
        access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> would result in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> mining the literature for relevant papers and
        sending them to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> for consideration? In addition to papers related to their
        own classes and research, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> also enjoy learning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about ‚</NUMEX>Äúhot topics‚Äù from scientific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> and those stories that quickly reach the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX>. Examples include the
        use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> and sequencing to identify the causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SARS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) and a good review article of small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitory RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillin 2003).</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> common educational goals are to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to become skeptical of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unsubstantiated</ENAMEX> claims and to enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to evaluate data critically. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to
        accomplish these goals is to capitalize on the natural curiosity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and ask them
        to compare topics in the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> to that in the scientific literature (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">davidson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/courses/genomics/2003/poulton/p21.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>). Open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>
        make these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> educational goals much more feasible because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> can utilize current
        findings immediately without having to wait for interlibrary loans, which can take up to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>, can cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $20</NUMEX> per article, and can result in poor-quality black-and-white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photocopies</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Ä¶ and for Thought-Provoking Testing</ENAMEX>
        If we want <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to achieve higher levels of thinking (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloom et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>), we need to
        model our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> can learn by examples and are rewarded for learning to
        critically evaluate data and for inspecting evidence before believing claims made by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yarden 2003).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> quickly figure out what intellectual behaviors
        are rewarded in exams. If exam questions simply require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to regurgitate factoids,
        then higher levels of thinking are unlikely to be demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. It is difficult
        to create good exam questions that cover the course material and reward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who have
        learned to read critically and to interpret data. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>, increasingly I
        have turned to current literature to find raw data for my exam questions. For example, for
        my genomics class in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fall 2003</TIMEX>, I used a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> published in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> that utilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarrays to analyze the life cycle of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>-causing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plasmodium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bozdech et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). I asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to interpret several
        figures, using their own words (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Owing to my choosing to use an open-access
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> also had full access to the supporting information, which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
        utilized to enhance their answers. For this question, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> produced answers that were
        better than mine. Another exam question required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to mine a database associated
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bozdech</ENAMEX> paper (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://malaria.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">php</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> were asked to
        combine what they learned from the paper and the course and choose new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (in
        addition to the ones described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bozdech et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>]) that would make good candidates
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> based on the timing of gene transcription. In order to answer this question,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> performed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> steps in real research, which rewards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> for learning
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">higher-order</ENAMEX> thinking skills.
        At the end of their exam, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> were given an opportunity for extra credit points (a
        maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> points out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> available on the exam) if they provided constructive
        criticism directly to the database <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 70%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> sent comments,
        including this one: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIn recently using your database, I found it difficult to search the 
        Plasmodium gene expression data with multiple constraints. For example,
        it would be helpful if there were a way to identify all the genes within a certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that fell within certain time or amplitude constraints. Is this possible
        in this database?‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> very professionally responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>' suggestions,
        which resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new search capacities being added to the database, as can be seen
        on the left side of the main page (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://malaria.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ucsf</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edu/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">php</ENAMEX>). As a result of
        these professional interactions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>,
        interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, while taking
        their exams.
        The use of open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> for teaching and testing has already improved my
        courses. I can provide exam questions that are more interesting, more educational, and more
        current. Furthermore, I accomplish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tasks simultaneously: I keep abreast of new
        developments in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> and I write exam questions. But what do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> think? While I
        have not formally assessed student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX>, I have collected information from
        end-of-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">semester</TIMEX> course evaluations, including the following comments: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúOne of the best
        parts of the entire course for me were the exams. The exams really gave me an opportunity
        to show how I could work through real problems. This class definitely increased my critical
        thinking skills. Each test presented me with new ideas and problems to work through. I
        enjoyed the idea that each exam would be a learning experience.‚Äù
      
      
        The Future
        Teaching is a lot like raising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> provide learning
        opportunities in part by modeling the behavior we want our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to learn. By choosing
        the most current literature as testing material, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> realize that I read the
        literature to stay current in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> and that there are always new opportunities to
        learn, analyze, and design experiments, etc. By my choosing open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> such as
        those published in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> , my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> benefit from free access to published research
        results. Free access to research literature enhances <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> learning and helps produce the
        next generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate students</ENAMEX>, who are then better trained. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Open-access</ENAMEX> publishing
        provides the right mix of benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> alike.
