        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 35 million</NUMEX> HIV-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with significant
        resource limitations. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are in
        urgent need of antiretroviral therapy, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 700,000</NUMEX> currently receive effective treatment
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Global treatment efforts, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">√¢‚Ç¨≈ì3 by 5√¢‚Ç¨ Initiative</ENAMEX>, aim to extend therapy to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. While the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiretroviral medications</ENAMEX> has
        dropped considerably, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obstacles</ENAMEX>, including the cost, technical, and operational
        requirements of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts, viral loads, and other sophisticated diagnostic tests used to
        initiate and monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment, remain to be addressed.
        In particular, measurements of CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> are essential for staging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        determining their need for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiretroviral medications</ENAMEX>, and monitoring the course of their
        infection [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">count√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùexpressed</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> as the absolute number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4 cells</ENAMEX> per microliter of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as a percentage of total lymphocytes
        or total T lymphocytes√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùhas enormous prognostic and therapeutic
        implications, and forms the basis for most <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment decisions
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú6</NUMEX>]. In developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts are typically performed every
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to six months</TIMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> using the method of flow cytometry. Flow cytometers
        use lasers to excite fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> probes specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> and other cell surface
        markers, to distinguish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of lymphocyte from another. Several
        factors√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùincluding the cost of a flow cytometer (which ranges from
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30,000 to $150,000</NUMEX>), technical and operational complexity, the need for reliable
        electricity, and the high cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagents√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùhave</ENAMEX> made these instruments
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impractical</ENAMEX> and/or difficult to sustain in resource-scarce settings. The urgent need for
        affordable and technically simple CD4 diagnostics is widely recognized
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú11</NUMEX>].
        Several efforts have been made to develop alternative, affordable CD4 counting methods
        for resource-poor settings. Single-purpose flow cytometers have been designed solely for
        counting CD4 cells, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson FACSCount</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partec CyFlow</ENAMEX>, and desktop
        instruments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guava</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PointCare Technologies</ENAMEX>. Although these newer versions make flow
        cytometry more affordable in some settings, reagent costs remain high, and the instruments
        remain expensive and in most cases, technically complex [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú13</NUMEX>]. Low-cost
        microbead separation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> cells from other blood cells, followed by standard manual cell
        counting techniques using a light microscope, offers significantly lower reagent costs than
        flow cytometry. These methods, however, are low throughput and extremely labor intensive,
        and appear to be less accurate than traditional flow cytometry; thus, they have not been
        widely adopted [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú18</NUMEX>].
        Less expensive CD4 counting methods that capitalize on low-cost microfabrication,
        efficient light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, and affordable microelectronics and digital imaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware</ENAMEX> have
        been conceptualized, but never realized [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,20</NUMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of us (JTM) has previously reported
        the development of a novel microchip-based detection system for measuring analytes such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>, electrolytes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in solution phase [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú23</NUMEX>]. This
        electronic taste chip (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETC</ENAMEX>) system carries out chemical and immunological reactions on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microspheres</ENAMEX> positioned in the inverted pyramidal microchamber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of a silicon or
        plastic microchip, which is housed in a miniature flow cell. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microfluidic</ENAMEX> channels deliver
        a series of small-volume reagents and washes to the flow cell, and hence to the chip and to
        each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the microspheres. Optical signals generated by the reactions on the
        microspheres are visualized and captured on a charge-coupled device (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX>) with the use of
        transfer optics and a digital video chip. Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ETC</ENAMEX> system, complex immunological
        assays, such as the ones developed to quantify cardiac risk factors in serum, can be
        performed with small sample volumes, short analysis times, and markedly reduced reagent
        costs [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        Further development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ETC</ENAMEX> system has shown that it could be adapted to the
        detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, spores, and living cells [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. We hypothesized that additional
        modifications could be made to provide accurate, low-cost CD4 counts to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection in resource-constrained settings. We show that a microchip-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> can
        perform CD4 counts from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16.5 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> rapidly, simply, and with a high
        degree of accuracy compared to flow cytometry, particularly for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">below 500 cells/√é¬ºl.</ENAMEX> We suggest how this prototype system can be readily
        developed as a low-cost, portable device for use in resource-poor settings.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Flow Cell
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ETC</ENAMEX> system was originally designed for microsphere-based assays
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú23</NUMEX>]. The modified version of the flow cell (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is
          enclosed within a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-piece metal casing with a flat platform permanently affixed to a
          circular vertical support, which is in turn connected to a screw-on cap. Within the metal
          casing there are top and bottom plastic inserts made from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMMA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fluids</ENAMEX> are introduced to
          and drained out of the flow cell through integrated stainless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> tubing within the
          inserts. The bottom PMMA insert also features a plastic screen disc that acts as a
          support for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-√é¬ºm Nuclepore</ENAMEX> polycarbonate, track-etch filter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whatman</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Florham Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), which serves as a lymphocyte capture and red
          blood cell separation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">membrane</ENAMEX>. A gasket between the membrane and the top insert prevents
          leaks and ensures that the entire sample is delivered into the flow cell and filtered
          through the membrane. The top outlet is used with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> flow for the removal of air
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bubbles</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluid Delivery System</ENAMEX>
          In initial studies, we used a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">peristaltic</ENAMEX> pump to deliver sample and washes to
          the flow cell. Subsequently, a partially automated fluid delivery system was developed.
          This functional adaptation uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> peristaltic pumps, each in conjunction
          with a pinch valve, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.031</NUMEX>-in. (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.79</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-mm</ENAMEX>) silicone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tubing</ENAMEX> capable of delivering flow
          rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">46√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú920 √é¬ºl/min</ENAMEX> to the flow cell. Integrated
          software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LabVIEW</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) directs delivery
          of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> and washes to the flow cell using the appropriate pumps and
          valves. Sample filtrate, including red blood cells, is captured in a waste reservoir.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optical Station</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Image Capture</ENAMEX>
          The flow cell was positioned on the stage of a modified BX2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olympus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>)
          compound microscope equipped with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10√É‚</NUMEX>Äî objective lens and a high-pressure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> W mercury burner arc lamp as a light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Focusing was maintained on a fixed plane
          throughout the duration of the assay. Visualization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AlexaFluor</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647</NUMEX>-stained lymphocytes
          was achieved using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cy5 filter cube</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">620</NUMEX> nm excitation, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">660 nm long-</NUMEX>pass beam splitter
          dichroic mirror, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> nm emission), while AlexaFluor-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">488</NUMEX>-stained lymphocytes were
          visualized with a fluoroisothiocyanate (FITC) filter <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">480</NUMEX> nm excitation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">505</NUMEX> nm
          long-pass beam splitter dichroic mirror, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">535</NUMEX> √Ç¬± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> nm emission). For each
          study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>, images were obtained from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> nonoverlapping regions of the
          lymphocyte capture membrane in the flow cell, using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-bit</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> digital camera (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DVC</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) mounted on the microscope. Each imaged region represented
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.18 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, so that for each assay, cells were counted from a
          total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.9 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> was imaged serially with both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> cubes. The corresponding images were stored separately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as monochromatic eight-bit</NUMEX>
          images for subsequent digital image analysis and automated cell counting.
        
        
          Image <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Images were analyzed using a custom algorithm supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Image-Pro Plus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX>
          Cybernetics, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver Spring</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) processing software. An iterative
          approach allowed for flexible analysis of data acquired under different conditions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illumination</ENAMEX>, focus, and sampling. For each iteration, an upper and lower value defined a
          range of green or red intensities that were then used to segment the image. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pixels</ENAMEX> whose
          intensity values fell within the defined range were reassigned values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, while all
          others were set to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The process yielded a binary version of the original <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight-bit</NUMEX>
          image. A lymphocyte selection algorithm was then applied. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Objects</ENAMEX> (i.e., lymphocytes)
          were defined as contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of pixels with values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Object selection was
          refined by a lymphocyte profile (defined by size, aspect ratio, and uniformity); objects
          not fitting the profile were not counted. The number of counted objects was recorded for
          each iteration. From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> iteration to the next, the upper and lower intensity limits used
          to segment the image were both increased by a single intensity count. The final cell
          count per image was the maximum object count <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 256 iterations</NUMEX> (upper intensity limits
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1√¢‚Ä†‚Äô255</ENAMEX>) for which the average object roundness fell below a threshold
          value. In this manner, the software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> determined the optimal analysis parameters
          for each image individually, greatly relaxing the stringency of image capture
          requirements. Cell counts were recorded in a spreadsheet as numbers of CD4
          + CD3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô</ENAMEX> , CD4
          + CD3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> , CD4
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô</ENAMEX> CD3

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô</ENAMEX> CD3
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">+</ENAMEX> , and CD4
          + CD8
          + cells, depending on the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used. Absolute CD4
          counts were recorded as the summed number of CD4
          + CD3
          + cells counted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over five</NUMEX> images, normalized per microliter of imaged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. CD4:CD8 ratios were recoded as the ratio of CD4
          + CD3
          + cells to CD8
          + CD3
          + cells counted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over five</NUMEX> images. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Relative CD4</ENAMEX> abundance as a
          percentage of total T lymphocytes was recorded as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times the ratio of CD4
          + CD3
          + cells to total CD3
          + cells, with cells counted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over five</NUMEX> images.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lymphocyte Staining</ENAMEX> and Delivery
          Antibodies utilized in these studies were stored at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> √Ç¬∞C and centrifuged to
          remove precipitated material prior to use. This process ensured removal of fluorescent
          particulate matter that could be captured by the membrane and might interfere with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imaging</ENAMEX>. For the initial dilution control studies, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> cells were purified by
          immunomagnetic separation from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> buffy coats. CD4 cells labeled with
          AlexaFluor-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">488</NUMEX>-conjugated anti-CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A21335</ENAMEX>, clone

          introduced to the flow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in amounts ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX> cells, and washed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phosphate buffered saline</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>). For whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> studies, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of whole
          blood collected by venipuncture was incubated at ambient temperature
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú25 √Ç¬∞C</ENAMEX>) with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AlexaFluor-488-</ENAMEX> and

          (representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.5</NUMEX> √é¬ºl of the original sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>) and then washed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. Because red blood cells are mechanically separated from white blood cells, red
          blood cell lysis is not necessary. Images of labeled cells captured on the membrane were
          obtained and analyzed as described above. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> (scanning electron microscopy), a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fixative</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2% paraformaldehyde/2.5%</NUMEX> glutaraldehyde) was added into the flow cell and
          rinsed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. The filter was removed from the flow cell, fixed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> s with OsO
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> vapor, and then dehydrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EtOH/HMDS</ENAMEX>. The same SEM protocol was

          milliliters of venous whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was collected from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> (in EDTA

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickinson FACSCalibur</ENAMEX>, using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MultiTEST</ENAMEX> reagents and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TruCOUNT</ENAMEX> beads, and analyzed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MultiSET</ENAMEX> software. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were processed by flow cytometry according to
          standard operating procedure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> reference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX>. The majority

          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 h</NUMEX> of blood collection. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were enrolled, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>

          The accuracy of the microchip-based CD4 counting system was determined by comparing

        Results
        In initial experiments using the original ETC system [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú23</NUMEX>],
        microspheres were coated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoclonal antibodies</ENAMEX> to the lymphocyte surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">markers CD3</ENAMEX>,
        CD4, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, followed by microfluidic delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled lymphocytes from
        whole blood obtained from non-HIV-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Although lymphocytes were readily
        captured, precise quantification of cell numbers and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts were not possible
        using the microsphere as a surface for lymphocyte capture (data not shown). We next
        modified the flow cells with a disposable, microporous membrane filter for lymphocyte
        capture. A single polycarbonate, track-etch membrane with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-√é¬</NUMEX>ºm pores was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immobilized</ENAMEX> and secured within the flow cell, creating a lymphocyte capture surface with a
        surface area of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> mm
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> were delivered to the flow cell from a sample
        reservoir tube, and the membrane within the flow cell was washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> from a second
        reservoir. As in the original ETC system, cells were imaged under fluorescence optics using
        a mercury arc lamp light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> camera (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        To confirm that cells could be adequately captured, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of unprocessed
        whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from non-HIV-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> was incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 min</TIMEX> with
        fluorophore-conjugated anti-CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, and delivered by a peristaltic pump to the
        modified microfluidics chip. Red blood cells passed readily through the pores under
        appropriate fluid flow conditions. In contrast, the majority of white blood cells were
        captured onto a single imaging focal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This mechanical separation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autofluorescent</ENAMEX> red blood cells allows for the imaging and counting of white blood cells
        from unprocessed whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> without additional sample processing, such as centrifugation
        or red blood cell lysis. Using the digital imaging system originally developed for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">microsphere</ENAMEX>-based capture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ETC</ENAMEX> system, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled white blood cells can
        then be imaged directly on the chip and counted.
        To assess the analytical validity of the membrane-based microchip system, we first
        performed a dilution control study to evaluate the correlation between total fluorescence
        intensity and the absolute number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified CD4 cells</ENAMEX> from non-HIV-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        (labeled with fluorophore-conjugated anti-CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>) captured in the microchamber. The
        results show a linear correlation between the number of cells in the sample and the
        intensity of light emitted from the membrane filter (
        R
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.999</NUMEX>) for a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts relevant to advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú200 CD4 cells/√é¬</ENAMEX>ºl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dose√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúresponse</ENAMEX> study established proof of the concept that a modified
        microfluidic flow cell and a digital image analysis system can accurately detect and
        measure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood lymphocytes</ENAMEX> labeled with fluorescent markers.
        We next quantified the percentages of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX>
        from healthy control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> using this system. Prior to delivery to the flow cell, we
        labeled a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33-√é¬</NUMEX>ºl whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> sample with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of
        fluorophore-conjugated anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD3</NUMEX> and anti-CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 min</NUMEX> off chip, then diluted
        the sample with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">961 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and delivered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> √é¬ºl of the resulting
        sample (containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16.5 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>) to the flow cell using a fluidics
        controller. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> images from one region of the lymphocyte capture membrane were obtained
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different emission filters, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specific for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AlexaFluor-488-</ENAMEX>conjugated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> used to stain CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes green (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>), and the other specific for the
        AlexaFluor-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">647</NUMEX>-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> used to stain CD3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes red (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). Automated digital merging of the two
        images and image processing allowed the system to distinguish the CD3
        + CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes of interest (i.e., √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cells√¢‚Ç¨</ENAMEX>), which appear yellow, from the CD4
        + CD3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô monocytes</ENAMEX> (green) and the CD3
        + CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes (red) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>).
        We next developed a custom algorithm for translating these digital images into accurate
        CD4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD8 T</ENAMEX> cell counts using pixel analysis with the aid of a commercial image
        processing package. Automated counting of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subsets of cells was based on object
        size, aspect ratio, and uniformity, iterated across the range of color intensity levels. As
        shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4D</TIMEX>, a binary mask first removes the unwanted cell types, and residual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD4 T</ENAMEX> cells are counted. A similar protocol was applied to a second
        aliquot of blood stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AlexaFluor-647-conjugated CD3</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">AlexaFluor-488-conjugated</ENAMEX> CD8-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to visualize and count CD3
        + CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes.
        In order to calculate an absolute <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count with standard flow cytometry, one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        measures must be undertaken to calculate a concentration in cells per microliter. Either a
        standardized reference reagent, such as calibration beads at a known concentration, can be
        added to the assay (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìsingle-platform√¢‚Ç¨ flow cytometry), or an
        absolute total lymphocyte count in cells per microliter can be obtained on a hematology
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">analyzer (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìdual-platform√</ENAMEX>¢‚Ç¨ flow cytometry). The microchip
        assay we describe here uses a direct volumetric method and functions as a single-platform
        approach. By delivering a consistent volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> to the flow chamber (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.5</NUMEX>
        √é¬ºl of stained whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, diluted to a total volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>), and calculating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> per digital image (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.18 √é¬ºl</NUMEX>), we
        were able to count the total number of CD4
        + CD3
        + cells in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.9 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, and determine the absolute CD4
        count per microliter.
        We next tested this rapid, whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood microchip assay</ENAMEX> in a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> acquired
        in an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> reference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy consecutive</TIMEX> HIV-infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
        presenting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> reference laboratory for standard CD4 counting as part of a vertical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> study were enrolled, of whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> were adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Parallel samples</ENAMEX> were processed by standard four-color flow cytometry on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACSCalibur</ENAMEX>. The time from blood collection to complete analysis and results reporting
        using the chip-based assay was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 15 min</NUMEX> per sample. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult participants</ENAMEX>
        did not have valid flow cytometry results available, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> for
        analysis.
        Representative processed data images from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult women</ENAMEX> and one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infant</ENAMEX>, are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX> shows a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">31-y</NUMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with an absolute <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count
        by flow cytometry of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX> cells/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√é¬ºl</ENAMEX>. While numerous CD3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cells (red) are present as well as scattered monocytes (green), her
        low <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count is reflected in the few double-labeled CD3
        + CD4
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cells (yellow) seen in the image. Similar representative data images
        from a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</NUMEX> cells/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√é¬ºl</ENAMEX> by flow cytometry and a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-mo-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.39</NUMEX> by flow cytometry are also
        shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B and 5C</TIMEX>, respectively. These images illustrate the dynamic range of the
        membrane capture and digital image analysis system, including the ability to quantify both
        absolute CD4 counts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> percentages.
        We compared results from our microchip assay with results available from flow cytometry,
        the latter obtained on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACSCalibur</ENAMEX> through standard clinical laboratory operating
        procedures. The data for adult absolute CD4 counts are plotted in the
        Bland√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúAltman methods comparison plot shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> adult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 to 1,087</NUMEX> cells/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√é¬ºl</ENAMEX> (mean, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">372</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cells/√é¬ºl</ENAMEX>) by flow cytometry, results show a good correlation between absolute
        CD4 counts measured by our microchip assay and those measured by flow cytometry.
        Bland√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúAltman methods comparison analysis shows a bias of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô50 cells/√é¬ºl</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô81</ENAMEX>
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√¢ÀÜ‚Äô20 cells/√é¬ºl</ENAMEX>), and good <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> limits of agreement (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        Several of the results from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> at the higher end of absolute CD4 counts fall
        outside the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> limits. For these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> may overlap in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> images (as seen in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5C</NUMEX>), which can interfere with the accuracy of the
        lymphocyte counting algorithm. In resource-limited settings, the primary use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts
        is as a trigger to initiate antiretroviral therapy, which typically occurs at a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> count
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 cells/√é¬ºl.</ENAMEX> Higher <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> count thresholds of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350 and 500</NUMEX> cells/√é¬ºl
        are also used to increase the intensity of monitoring. For these values, the sensitivity
        and specificity of our method are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CD4 < 250</ENAMEX>, sensitivity = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX>, specificity = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX>;
        CD4 < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX>, sensitivity = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX>, specificity = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4 < 500</ENAMEX>, sensitivity = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>,
        specificity = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important application of our method is in pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> monitoring. The wide range
        of normal absolute CD4 counts in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> requires the use of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CD4:CD8</TIMEX> ratios or
        CD4 percentages in pediatric infection. Results for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CD4:CD8</TIMEX> ratios and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> percentages of T
        lymphocytes for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>) are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.
        Agreement, bias, and correlations between the microchip method and flow cytometry are
        excellent for both CD4 percentages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7A and 7B</TIMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CD4:CD8</TIMEX> ratios
        (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7C and 7D</TIMEX>). Bland√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúAltman plots for both CD4 percentages of T
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocytes</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CD4:CD8</TIMEX> ratios show low proportional bias, with tight <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> limits of
        agreement. Correlations are excellent for both CD4 percentages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes (
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>, 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CD4:CD8</TIMEX> ratios (
        r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX>, 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). Overall, the data show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> approaches to
        measuring CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts can be accurately quantified using the microchip method, and that
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and pediatric <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD4</TIMEX> results can be obtained.
        To determine assay variability, we examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> replicate samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>, using the established basic protocol. We determined
        that the coefficient of variance was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> (data not shown), which is similar to other
        methods of CD4 counting [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Although the assay described here introduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.5</NUMEX>
        √é¬ºl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> into the system, the actual volume of blood analyzed by digital
        image analysis is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 0.90 √é¬ºl</NUMEX>. We have conducted preliminary studies that
        suggest that we can accurately measure CD4 counts from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 5 √é¬ºl</NUMEX> of blood
        obtained via fingerstick (data not shown); additional studies will be required to assess
        the correlation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts obtained by fingerstick and by venipuncture.
      
      
        Discussion
        Our results provide proof of principle that low-cost microfluidic structures combined
        with fluorescence imaging and digital image analysis can be successfully applied to the
        measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> counts, which are critical to the clinical management of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection. The method described here can deliver both absolute CD4 counts for adult
        monitoring, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> percentages or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">CD4:CD8</TIMEX> ratios for pediatric monitoring. Most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, the rapid and accurate CD4 assessments obtained with this method, together
        with its anticipated low cost relative to flow cytometry, may make this type of approach
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> for resource-scarce settings. As our results show, this method may be less accurate
        at the higher range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts, where cells may be more likely to overlap in our digital
        images. While this may limit its applicability, our method is accurate at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> counts below
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> cells/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√é¬ºl</ENAMEX>, which represent the clinically relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4</ENAMEX> levels in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>-poor settings. In addition, both the bias in the method described here
        (√¢ÀÜ‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äô50</NUMEX> cells) and the accuracy at higher CD4 counts are likely to be
        improved significantly by the further development of a disposable microfluidic cartridge,
        where the volume of distribution of the sample will be much smaller, and more accurate
        volumetric control will be possible.
        Our study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of our method against the gold standard
        in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. During enrollment, a small number of pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were made
        available to us by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princess Marina Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botswana</ENAMEX>. We chose to include
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in the data presented here to provide proof of principle that pediatric CD4
        percentages can also be assessed with this method. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
        available, limiting claims of statistical significance, we believe the issue of pediatric
        CD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">count</ENAMEX> monitoring to be of such importance that the data merited inclusion. Excluding
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pediatric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> does not affect the analysis.
        The results presented here were obtained with a stationary, tabletop monitoring system
        using a standard epifluorescence microscope and commercial image processing software. While
        the methods we described provide the basis for a highly portable and flexible miniaturized
        CD4 counting system, it should be emphasized that a number of additional developments are
        required to enable the widespread use of this approach in resource-limited settings. With
        additional engineering of optics, electronics, and mechanical components along with
        advancements in integrated microfluidic systems, it should be possible to develop a
        point-of-care instrument that is battery-powered, uses simple light emitting diodes (LEDs),
        and secures analyzable digital images with affordable video imaging chips. When combined
        with an embedded microprocessor and disposable assay cartridges for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and
        pediatric monitoring manufactured from injection-molded plastic, it should be possible to
        create a functional CD4 counting device that can be used at the point of care. Further
        trials in a larger, more diverse cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, including adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, will
        be necessary to confirm the accuracy of the method, including an assessment of assay bias
        and reproducibility. Such a device is currently in commercial development, and may be
        available by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2006</TIMEX>. While it is too early to provide an accurate cost estimate for a
        portable instrument and disposable plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CD4 assay</ENAMEX>, we expect the equipment cost would be
        substantially lower than for flow cytometry, and the assay cost would be similar to assays
        using existing methods (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        Although several CD4 counting systems are now used in resource-limited settings, they
        remain suboptimal to meet the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> care and treatment scale-up. None can truly be
        used at the point of care beyond a district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or similar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, and either the
        capital and operating costs remain high, or throughput is low, or both (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Pediatric
        monitoring using CD4 percentages also remains largely unavailable. The method we describe
        here addresses several of the limitations of performing diagnostic assays in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>-limited settings. First, sample volumes are minimal, so that tests can be
        performed on fingerstick samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, circumventing the need for venipuncture, and
        minimizing both medical waste and operator exposure to biohazardous material. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> use is minimized in the microchip system, reducing reagent costs by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 90%</NUMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, labor- and equipment-intensive sample preparation is eliminated. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">microchip CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> is extremely rapid. CD4 results in the prototype system described here
        are available in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 15</TIMEX> min from the time of blood collection. In a mature
        microfluidic device with push-button operation, results should be available in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 10</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX>, and thus can be used to make real-time clinical decisions at the point of care. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>,
        the assay is technically simple, analogous to a portable glucometer, and ultimately will be
        useable by a health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in remote settings with minimal training, extending the
        reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> to district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and remote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, and reducing labor costs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixth</ENAMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and pediatric monitoring are possible.
        We believe that the future of low-cost diagnostics for use in the developing world lies
        in the development of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>-on-a-chip technologies that integrate sample preparation and
        sample measurement systems into miniaturized devices with minimal power requirements.
        Preliminary cost estimates for the instrumentation here described suggest, at a minimum, a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold reduction in the cost for the associated measurement system. Further, reagent
        consumption for the microchip system can be reduced by a similar factor relative to flow
        cytometry, while sample storage and shipping costs are expected to be reduced dramatically
        by virtue of the point-of-care capabilities of this new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>-on-a-chip <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. The
        importance of microtechnologies to the realities of laboratory infrastructure worldwide has
        been recognized previously [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú30</NUMEX>]. Although CD4 counting represents the
        most urgent need in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> diagnostics for resource-poor settings, the microchip <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> is
        adaptable to other important assays. Through the interface of the lymphocyte capture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> described here with the previously reported microchip arrays, cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assays</ENAMEX> like
        CD4 counts can be multiplexed with other molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biomarker</ENAMEX> measurements (i.e., proteins
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX>) on a single miniaturized chip. The rapid extension of the chip-based CD4
        counting method described here to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA measurements</ENAMEX>, diagnostics for opportunistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, liver enzymes, and other biochemical markers of interest in infectious disease
        is feasible.
