        imagination since the time of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>. The deep-seated roots of this early
        fascination can be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mythology. The many-headed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hydra</ENAMEX> nearly defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>
        Heracles by growing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> for every one that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heracles</ENAMEX> cut off, and the liver of
        Prometheus, devoured by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ravenous eagle</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each night</TIMEX>, regenerated every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. Aristotle,
        who lived from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384‚Äì322</NUMEX> BC, noted that the tails of lizards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, as well as the eyes
        of swallow-chicks, could regenerate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aristotle 1965).</ENAMEX> This fascination became a legitimate
        area of scientific inquiry in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1712</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ren√</ENAMEX>©-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antoine Ferchault de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√©aumur</ENAMEX> published his seminal work on crayfish limb and claw regeneration (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">R√©aumur 1712</ENAMEX>).
        Soon thereafter, several other prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> of the eighteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham Trembley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bonnet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Simon Pallas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazzaro Spallanzani</ENAMEX>, discovered
        remarkable regenerative abilities in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Hydra, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">earthworms</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planarians</ENAMEX> could regenerate their heads and tails (Pallas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1766</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenhoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lenhoff 1986</ENAMEX>);
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salamanders</ENAMEX> could regenerate their limbs, tails, and jaws; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">premetamorphic frogs</ENAMEX> and toads
        could regenerate their tails and legs; slugs could regenerate their horns; and snails could
        regenerate their heads (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spallanzani 1769).</ENAMEX> This last discovery caused quite a stir in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, leading to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúunprecedented assault‚Äù</ENAMEX> on snails as both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">naturalists</ENAMEX> and the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> participated in the quest for scientific knowledge by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reproducing Spallanzani</ENAMEX>'s intriguing results (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newth 1958).</ENAMEX>
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stem Cells Versus Dedifferentiation</ENAMEX>
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX> and for most of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twentieth century</TIMEX>, regeneration
        research primarily focused on the phenomenology of regeneration and its cellular basis.
        Many important discoveries were made during this period, which led in part to the general
        conclusion that progenitor cells are required for most regenerative processes. However, the
        origin of these progenitor cells varies between regenerating systems. In some cases, such
        as the regeneration of skin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, muscle, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> in mammals and the replacement of lost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> in the flatworm planarian, the progenitor cells pre-exist as reserve cells or stem
        cells that only need to be activated in response to injury or tissue depletion. In other
        cases, the progenitor cells can be created de novo through a process in which fully
        differentiated cells reverse their normal developmental processes and revert to
        proliferating progenitor cells. This latter process, known as cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dedifferentiation</ENAMEX>,
        is especially prominent in vertebrates with exceptional regenerative abilities, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salamanders</ENAMEX>. For example, during salamander limb regeneration, cells from muscle, bone,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cartilage</ENAMEX>, nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sheath</ENAMEX>, and connective tissues participate in the dedifferentiation
        process to form a pool of proliferating progenitor cells known as the regeneration blastema
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) (Chalkley <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodemer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Everett</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fischman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallace et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lo et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumar et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). It has not yet been determined whether
        pre-existing stem cells or reserve cells also contribute to the pool of progenitor
        cells‚Äînor whether the blastemal cells are multipotent (capable of differentiating into
        multiple cell types), are committed to a particular cell lineage, or are a mix of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multipotent</ENAMEX> and committed progenitor cells. Regardless, these blastemal cells will later
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redifferentiate</ENAMEX> to form all the internal tissues of the regenerated limb other than the
        peripheral nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">axons</ENAMEX>. This extraordinary degree of cellular plasticity distinguishes
        those vertebrates that can replace entire anatomical structures, such as limbs, from
        vertebrates with more limited regenerative abilities.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> has recently exhibited a renewed interest in regeneration research, due in
        large part to stem cell research, which has provided promising <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> for the field of
        regenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Reeve</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> have given a human face to the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who could benefit from effective
        regenerative therapies. The political, ethical, and religious controversies surrounding the
        use of human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes have only served to increase the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">public</ENAMEX>'s awareness of the promising potential of regenerative medicine. But this interest
        in using scientific knowledge to enhance the regenerative capacity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is not new.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spallanzani</ENAMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his 1768</TIMEX> monograph on regeneration, 
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Essay on Animal Reproductions</ENAMEX> , with a series of questions‚Äî which,
        except for the antiquated language, could be asked by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first century</TIMEX>:
        But if the abovementioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, either aquatic or amphibious, recover their legs, even
        when kept on dry ground, how comes it to pass, that other land <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, at least such as
        are commonly accounted perfect, and are better known to us, are not endued with the same
        power? Is it to be hoped they may acquire them by some useful dispositions? [A]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nd</ENAMEX> should
        the flattering expectation of obtaining this advantage for ourselves be considered entirely
        as chimerical?
        Although most of the current interest in regenerative medicine focuses on the potential
        benefits of either embryonic or adult stem cells, there are several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> who are
        now taking an entirely different approach to the problem. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> think that
        although stem cells may offer some benefits in the relatively near future, a more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> approach will be required to meet all of our regenerative needs. To achieve
        this goal, they must first learn how nature has already solved the problem of regeneration
        and then use this information to enhance the regenerative capacity in mammals. These
        studies seek to understand the biology of regeneration, especially the cellular and
        molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative processes. The experimental systems range
        from the unicellular protozoa to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> vertebrates, such as salamanders and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Biology</ENAMEX> of Regeneration
        With the technological advances that followed the advent of molecular biology,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> acquired the basic tools to begin to unravel the molecular basis for cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasticity</ENAMEX> and regeneration. However, progress in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> has been slow, given that most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> with marked regenerative abilities are not yet amenable to routine genetic
        manipulation. Recent advances, such as the application of mutagenic screens to study fin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> in zebrafish (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weston</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poss et al.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2002b</ENAMEX>) and the application
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAi</ENAMEX> knockdown technology to study regeneration in planarians (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanchez Alvarado</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newmark</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newmark et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), are quite promising and could largely ameliorate this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, results from several recent studies have converged on a set of
        genes that appear to play an important role in regeneration, and evidence is accumulating
        that suggests some of these genes may function to control regenerative cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasticity</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> such genes are 
        Msx1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP4</TIMEX> , and 
        Notch1 . These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encode</ENAMEX>, respectively, a transcriptional repressor, a
        signaling ligand, and a signaling cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        Numerous studies over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX> have shown that mammals, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
        can regenerate their digit tips provided the amputation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> is distal to the terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phalangeal</ENAMEX> joint (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>; Illingworth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>; Borgens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>).
        However, 
        Msx1 -deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exhibit impaired fetal digit-tip regeneration, a
        phenotype that can be rescued in ex vivo cultures in a dose-dependent manner by application
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous BMP4</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> Recently, it has been demonstrated that 
        Xenopus tadpoles are unable to regenerate their tails during a
        refractory period of development between stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 and 47</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). If tails are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amputated</ENAMEX> during this refractory period, genes that are normally expressed during the early
        stages of tadpole tail regeneration, such as 
        BMP4, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Msx1</TIMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Notch-1</ENAMEX> , are not expressed. However, transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> carrying a
        hyperactive form of 
        Msx1 or constitutively active 
        ALK3 (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP4</TIMEX>) are able to regenerate their tails during the
        refractory period. Transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX> carrying a constitutively active 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Notch-1</ENAMEX> receptor will regenerate their notochords and spinal cords but
        exhibit little or no muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">regeneration</ENAMEX>, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notch-1</ENAMEX> signaling alone cannot
        rescue complete regenerative capacity in frog tadpoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beck et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). Results from
        expression studies in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are consistent with these in vivo gene
        function studies. 
        Msx genes are upregulated in regenerating salamander limbs and
        regenerating zebrafish fins and hearts (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poss et al. 2002a; Raya et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), while 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">notch-1b</ENAMEX> and its ligand, 
        deltaC , are upregulated during zebrafish heart and fin regeneration
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raya et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>).
      
      
        Msx1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellular</ENAMEX> Plasticity
        Although these functional and expression studies indicate that 
        Msx1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bmp4</TIMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Notch-1</ENAMEX> are important for a variety of regenerative processes, they do
        not address the mechanism by which these genes exert their effects. However, several in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> studies suggest that 
        Msx1 may be involved in regulating cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasticity</ENAMEX>. Ectopic
        expression of 
        Msx1 can inhibit the differentiation of a variety of mesenchymal and
        epithelial progenitor cell types (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song et al. 1992; Hu et al. 2001</ENAMEX>), suggesting that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> may play a role in maintaining cells in an undifferentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, 
        Msx1 may be functioning not only to prevent differentiation of progenitor
        cells but also to induce dedifferentiation of cells that have already differentiated.
        Ectopic expression of 
        Msx1 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse myotubes</ENAMEX> (differentiated muscle cells that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multinucleated</ENAMEX> and are able to contract), coupled with serum stimulation, can induce these
        multinucleated cells to reduce their levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myogenic proteins</ENAMEX> and undergo a cell
        cleavage process that produces proliferating mononucleated cells (a process known as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cellularization</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odelberg et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Clonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of these dedifferentiated cells
        can redifferentiate into cells expressing markers for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, fat, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone cells</ENAMEX>, as
        well as myotubes. These results suggest that the combination of ectopic 
        Msx1 expression and serum stimulation can induce differentiated muscle
        cells to dedifferentiate into proliferating multipotent progenitor cells. Given this degree
        of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasticity</ENAMEX>, it is not surprising that 
        Msx1 can also induce muscle progenitor cells, known as myoblasts, to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dedifferentiate</ENAMEX> to multipotent progenitor cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odelberg et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
        Cellularization of myotubes and myoblast dedifferentiation can also be induced by at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trisubstituted purines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myoseverin</ENAMEX> is a trisubstituted purine that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to and disassembles microtubules, leading to the cellularization of multinucleated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myotubes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosania et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). The resulting mononucleated cells proliferate when
        stimulated with serum and redifferentiate into myotubes following serum starvation. A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trisubstituted purine, reversine, induces myoblasts to dedifferentiate into
        progenitor cells with adipogenic and osteogenic potential (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen et al. 2004).</ENAMEX> Therefore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reversine</ENAMEX> and 
        Msx1 appear to have a similar effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse myoblasts</ENAMEX>, although no
        reports have yet addressed whether reversine might induce dedifferentiation of
        multinucleated myotubes.
        In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Kumar et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) present data linking 
        Msx1 function to microtubule disassembly during the process of salamander
        myofiber cellularization and fragmentation (myofibers are formed from myotubes and
        represent the completely mature form of the differentiated skeletal muscle cell). Their
        results suggest that 
        Msx1 expression induces microtubule disassembly, which then leads to
        myofiber cellularization or fragmentation. If 
        Msx1 function is markedly reduced in salamander myofibers by preventing
        the efficient synthesis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Msx1 protein</ENAMEX>, cellularization or fragmentation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myofiber</ENAMEX> is inhibited, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Msx1</ENAMEX> is required for this process. Thus, this study
        complements previous work (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odelberg et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) showing that ectopic 
        Msx1 expression, coupled with serum stimulation, is sufficient to induce
        cleavage, cellularization, and dedifferentiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse myotubes</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies point
        to an essential role for 
        Msx1 in regenerative cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasticity</ENAMEX> and when combined with previous
        in vivo studies, raise the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP</ENAMEX> or Notch signaling might also play a role
        in this process.
        Results from these and other similar studies are beginning to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> a glimpse
        into the molecular mechanisms that control regeneration and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasticity</ENAMEX>. With the
        new tools available to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes and assess their function, the next few
        decades appear promising for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> engaged in regeneration research. Elucidating the
        molecular basis for regeneration may prove to be an essential step in devising effective
        methods for enhancing regeneration in mammals and may well usher in a golden era for
        regenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>.
