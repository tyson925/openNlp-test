        based on recurrent statistical patterns in other kinds of information, particularly data on
        climate, is an active area of research [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>]. Judging from the estimated burden of diseases
        for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWSs</ENAMEX> might be developed, such systems, if effective, would contribute greatly to
        human welfare and could potentially save many lives [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. According to a recent report [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWSs</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principal aims: (i) to identify whether an epidemic will occur and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) to
        predict the number of cases that will result from it. For directly transmitted diseases,
        this second aim may be unattainable at the desired levels of precision, regardless of the
        quality of information.
        As an example, in a recent report on the relationship between climate and outbreaks of
        meningococcal meningitis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> found that the timing of epidemics is highly
        predictable from information on the dynamics of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> weather pattern, the Harmattan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">winds</ENAMEX>, but that the final epidemic size is not [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. This finding is not surprising. The
        characteristics of disease outbreaks, particularly outbreaks of emerging diseases to which
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are highly susceptible, prevent highly precise forecasts.
        The reason that precise estimates of the final epidemic size cannot be obtained can be
        understood intuitively. Consider the following description of a typical outbreak.
        Characteristically, an outbreak begins with a small number of initially infectious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Subsequent infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> are mediated by a wide range of social
        interactions—contacts within and among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and communities—so that even individuals
        that are virtually identical can differ considerably in the number of secondary infections
        they cause. This is a micro-scale cause of variation compared with macro-scale,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>-level sources of variation. The important implication for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWSs</ENAMEX> is that in such
        situations, especially where the basic reproductive ratio of infections (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">R0</NUMEX>) is initially
        very high but is rapidly reduced (perhaps by public-health interventions), small deviations
        in the realized number of infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> are amplified, resulting in relatively large
        variation in the final size of the outbreak. Because this variation reflects differences in
        individual behavior and not macroscopic characteristics of epidemic spread, it is unlikely
        that climate or other data contain any information about this source of variation (though
        such data do contain information about macroscopic variation).
        A more formal explanation of this phenomenon can be formulated based on a simple model
        of an epidemic in which an EWS captures all macroscopic causes of variation in the final
        epidemic size but no microscopic causes. Obviously, an EWS cannot realistically be expected
        to capture even all the macroscopic information. Thus, this limit to precision is a
        fundamental limit and should be interpreted as a theoretical upper bound on forecast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX>. The simplest case considers a disease with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> macroscopic epidemiological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, an infection rate and a removal rate, which may change over time as in the
        case of meningococcal meningitis. In particular, we assume that there is no immunity in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and that infection and removal are independent in time. This model of disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX> belongs to a class of stochastic processes known as nonhomogenous birth–death
        processes, which, conveniently, turn out to be reasonably tractable. More than 50 years
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kendall</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] showed how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for the mean and the variance in the final epidemic size
        are affected by these parameters. The variance can be interpreted as a measure of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> with which the final epidemic size can be predicted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kendall</ENAMEX>'s results can be
        broken down to show that this quantity is equal to the sum of the average final epidemic
        size and another quantity (x) minus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. For most realistic epidemiological parameters,
        this other quantity, which is related to the covariance between final epidemic size and the
        size of the infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, will be much greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. In these cases, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in the final epidemic size will be much greater than the average final epidemic
        size itself.
        This fundamental limit to the precision of forecasts does not imply that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWSs</ENAMEX> cannot be
        used effectively to plan a response to outbreaks. Rather, it suggests what expectations of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWSs</ENAMEX> are reasonable. Further, since the precision with which forecasts of the final
        epidemic size can be obtained will depend on many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-specific properties and maybe
        other factors, too, case studies of the potential effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWSs</ENAMEX> for different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> are needed. These studies should exploit recent advances in modeling birth–death
        processes [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] to gain further understanding of the differences among diseases and of the
        causes of geographic variation in the intensity of epidemics. Finally, notwithstanding
        limits to precision, the benefits to be obtained from estimates of the average final
        epidemic size and the timing of epidemics alone may warrant considerable investment in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWSs</ENAMEX>.
