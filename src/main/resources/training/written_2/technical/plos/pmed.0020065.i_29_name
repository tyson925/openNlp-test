        the watchful eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and other health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, who have reported individual
        cases or clusters of cases of particular diseases to health-care and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. The
        increased availability of electronic health-care data, however, raises the possibility of
        more automated and earlier outbreak detection and subsequent intervention. Besides
        diagnoses of known diseases, pre-diagnostic syndromic indicators‚Äîsuch as the primary
        complaints of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> coming to the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> or calling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> hotline‚Äîare being
        collected in electronic formats and could be analyzed if suitable methods existed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kulldorff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have been developing such methods, and now report a new and very
        flexible approach for prospective infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> outbreak surveillance.
        Their method, which they call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúspace‚Äìtime permutation scan statistic</ENAMEX>,‚Äù is an
        extension of a method called scan statistic. All previously developed scan statistics
        require either (i) a uniform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at risk (with the same number of expected disease
        cases in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every square kilometer</NUMEX>), (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (such as emergency visits not due to
        the disease of interest), or (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) other data that provide information about the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geographical</ENAMEX> and temporal distribution of the underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> at risk, such as census
        numbers. The new method, because of a different probability model, can be used for the
        early detection of disease outbreaks when only the number of cases is available. It also
        corrects for missing data and makes minimal assumptions about the spatiotemporal
        characteristics of an outbreak. To make it widely accessible, the method has been
        implemented as a feature of the freely available <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SaTScan</ENAMEX> software.
        In their article, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kulldorff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> illustrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the new method by
        applying it to data collected from hospital emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> analyzed diarrhea records from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, and did both a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúresidential analysis‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        (based on the home address of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhospital analysis‚Äù</ENAMEX> (based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        locations). The former has more detailed geographical information, the latter maybe be
        better able to detect outbreaks not primarily related to place of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> but, for
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or workplace. They found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> highly unusual clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX> cases,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of which heralded citywide gastrointestinal outbreaks due to rotavirus and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">norovirus</ENAMEX>.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2003</TIMEX>, the space‚Äìtime permutation scan statistic has been used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to
        analyze emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> data in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> in parallel with other methods, and it
        seems to perform well. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> discuss, as any other surveillance method, theirs has
        limitations. Because it adjusts for purely temporal clusters, the method can only detect
        outbreaks if they start locally (not simultaneously across the entire surveillance area).
        The less geographically compact an outbreak is, the less power there is to detect it. And
        some outbreaks, for example, those caused by exposure to an infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>,
        will be hard to cluster by place of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> or choice of emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>.
        In the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kulldorff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have applied their method to infectious
        disease surveillance in a metropolitan area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. As they state, however,
        ‚Äúthe ability to perform disease surveillance without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-at-risk data is especially
        important in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, where these data may be hard to obtain.‚Äù
