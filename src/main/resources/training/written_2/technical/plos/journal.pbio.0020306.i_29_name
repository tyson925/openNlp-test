        professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> ever since the invention of the microscope. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, diatoms
        and their exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX> are also attracting the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nanotechnologists</ENAMEX> who hope
        that diatoms will teach them how to make minute structures currently beyond the
        capabilities of materials <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>. And now these nanotechnologists, together with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecologists</ENAMEX> interested in the global carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cycleâ</ENAMEX>€”in which diatoms play a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">roleâ</ENAMEX>€”have
        a genomic blueprint to help them in their studies: the annotated genome sequence of 
        Thalassiosira
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudonana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://genome.</ENAMEX>jgi-psf.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/diatom/</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Are Diatoms</ENAMEX>?
        Diatoms, microalgae that are found in all aquatic and moist environments, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 180 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. Since then, diatom diversity has literally exploded; no
        one is sure how many living species there areâ€”probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100,000â</NUMEX>€”or why there are so
        many different types. Plant molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Bowler</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stazione Zoologica, Napoli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>) explains that molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogeny</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphological</ENAMEX> studies suggest that diatoms originated â€˜probably as the result of a
        eukaryote being invaded or engulfed by a photosynthetic eukaryote, most probably a red
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algaâ€™.</ENAMEX>
        The basic structure of all diatoms is similar: a single cell, often with a large
        vacuole, contained within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a silica</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> or frustule made of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> overlapping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">valves</ENAMEX> joined by girdle bands, which are also made of silica. The girdle bands form the
        rims of the two valves and allow unidirectional growth of the diatom during vegetative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">â€˜The</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> is rather like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Camembert cheese</ENAMEX> box or a petri dishâ€™, explains
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Hamm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research</ENAMEX>,
        Bremerhaven, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>).
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> main types of diatom: centric diatoms, which often have a circular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symmetry</ENAMEX>, and pennate diatoms, which are usually bilaterally symmetrical. Nevertheless,
        diatom <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX> come in a dazzling array of forms and sizes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). â€˜They can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">circular</ENAMEX>, oval, stick-shaped, you name it, and range from several micrometres large to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a millimetreâ</NUMEX>€™, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Ann Tiffany</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), who is using scanning electron microscopy to examine diatom
        valve formation as part of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> studies. â€˜When a diatom divides, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cell
        makes a new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> shellâ€™, explains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage of construction is the
        generation and deposition of silica nanospheres; the more ornate structures are built up
        from there. Both the finished <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX>, with their precise and reproducible nanometre-scale
        features, and the intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that lead up to the finished product, could be of
        interest to nanotechnologists, suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Turning to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature for Engineering Solutions</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gordon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiology</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Manitoba</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winnipeg</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, somewhat accidentally laid the foundations of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€˜diatom nanotechnologyâ€™</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> when
        he was invited to give a lecture at an engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conference</ENAMEX>. â€˜I'm not an engineerâ€™,
        explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX>, â€˜but I knew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> were interested in what was then called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microfabrication</ENAMEX> so I told them about diatoms because they are so good at making small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thingsâ€™.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX>, a keen diatom hobbyist, explained to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> how diatoms could make a
        three-dimensional micro- or nanoscale <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for them without them lifting a finger. By
        contrast, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX>, â€˜nanotechnology techniques then and now are tedious, involving
        painstakingly building three-dimensional structures up layer by layerâ€™.
        Such tedious techniques are currently used in the semiconductor industry. At present,
        explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sussman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biotechnology Center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), â€˜features are etched onto circuit
        boards using light. However, the wavelength of light limits the smallest size that can be
        achieved, and for the next generation of faster computers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> need to get denser
        features onto computer chips than is possible with light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">etchingâ€™</ENAMEX>. Diatoms, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sussman</ENAMEX>,
        â€˜are natural-born lithographers in the nanometre range. If we could work out how diatoms
        lay down micro lines of silica, then we may be able to simulate itâ€™. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diatoms</ENAMEX> use to direct silica deposition could be very useful to the semiconductor industry,
        says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sussman</ENAMEX>.
        There are other ways in which diatoms could help us clumsy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> build nanoscale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜widgetsâ€™.</ENAMEX> Molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Hildebrand</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps Institution</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oceanography</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a collaborative project trying to develop
        genetically engineered micro/nanodevices (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GEMs</ENAMEX>). Already, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> are using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diatoms</ENAMEX> to help them build extremely sensitive sensors based on microfluidic devices, he
        explains. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hildebrand</ENAMEX> is also interested in the optical properties of diatoms. â€˜Information
        processing technology is moving from electronically to optically based hardware, which
        allows more information to be carried and stored. Optical systems need materials with
        regularly repeating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with features below the micrometre size range. These are
        very difficult to make by standard manufacturing techniques, but diatoms make structures
        like this all the timeâ€™.
        It might also be possible to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diatom shells</ENAMEX> as delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, suggests
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Rogers</ENAMEX>, an assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Technological University</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houghton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). â€˜They have a uniform nanoscale pore structure and are
        chemically inert and biocompatibleâ€™. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers</ENAMEX> envisages loading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">diatoms</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that
        would then leach out into the blood stream at a rate dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">diatom species</ENAMEX> used.
        By incorporating ferromagnetic particles within the diatom structure, it might be possible
        to use a magnet to guide the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> to the right organ, he suggests.
        Diatom <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> are not just of interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> interested in tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. As Hamm
        comments, â€˜in diatoms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature</ENAMEX> has solved many of the problems that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> want to solve.
        For example, diatoms are particularly good at making lightweight but strong structures.
        Because it is possible to scale static structures like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX>, diatoms can teach us how to
        make lightweight constructions for the aerospace and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car industryâ€™</ENAMEX>.
        Some of the potential applications of diatoms can be investigated right now, using
        naturally occurring diatoms. In addition, subtle but important changes can be induced in
        diatoms by varying the amount of silica in their environment or changing the water flow.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX> also envisages a device he calls a compustat, which would be used to select diatoms
        for a specific purpose. Diatoms taken from the sea, for example, would be individually
        examined using a computer-controlled microscope. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜We</ENAMEX> would tell the computer what
        characteristics we were looking for, and it would go through the culture, zapping those
        diatoms furthest from the ideal with a laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX>. The culture would then be allowed to
        grow up again and the process repeated until we got the sort of diatoms we wantedâ€™, says
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX> has not built a compustat yetâ€”it may not work, he says, because we don't know how
        far we can push diatoms by forced evolution. And even if the compustat does work, to make
        the most of the nanotechnological potential of diatoms, we need to know exactly how diatoms
        make their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX>. At present, all we know is that silicon transporters and a group of
        long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyamine-containing proteins</ENAMEX> called silaffins, which act as nucleation points
        for silica deposition, are involved. This is where the diatom sequencing project at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Department of the Environment</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Genome Initiative</ENAMEX> (JGI) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walnut</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Creek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, comes in.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Diatom</ENAMEX> Is Sequenced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Rokhsar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computational Genomics</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JGI</ENAMEX>, explains why his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institute</ENAMEX> undertook the sequencing and computer annotation of the genome of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana , a marine centric diatom â€˜We believe that knowing
        this genome will help us to figure out how to mimic the processes that diatoms use to
        construct their very precise structures, and that we can then learn how to create similarly
        precise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures ourselvesâ€™</ENAMEX>. Also, he adds, diatoms are extremely important on an
        ecological level.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oceanographer Ginger Armbrust</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>), Principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigator</ENAMEX> on the sequencing project for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana , explains further. Diatoms are responsible for
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 25% and 40%</NUMEX> of all the primary productivity of the oceans, she says. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜They</ENAMEX> also
        keep the biological pump going. By fixing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and then sinking, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diatoms</ENAMEX> draw
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> out of the atmosphere and take it into the deeper waters of the ocean, where
        it is retained for longer than it would be if the diatoms stayed near the surfaceâ€™.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana , she continues, was chosen as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> diatom to
        sequence in part because it has a small genome, but mainly because it represents a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> genus of diatoms and its physiology has been well studied. Once the primary
        sequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> had been determined, molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, oceanographers, and
        ecologists from around the world gathered at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JGI</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜genome jamboreeâ€™</ENAMEX>. â€˜The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of
        these was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2002</TIMEX>, a massive brainstorming session at which we all dug around in
        the genome for our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">favourite genes</ENAMEX> and tried to get a feel for what was thereâ€™, explains
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowler</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜It</ENAMEX> was really refreshing to get the insights of oceanographers and ecologists into
        what this genome was telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">usâ€™</ENAMEX>.
        Among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armbrust</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX> are interested in finding out what
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana genome can tell them about the difference between
        photosynthesis on land and in the sea. They also want to investigate how these organisms
        adapt to their environment. â€˜Now that we have the genomeâ€™, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armbrust</ENAMEX>, â€˜we can
        investigate how gene expression varies at different places in the water column, for
        example. This will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a eukaryotic genome has been interpreted in this
        ecological sort of wayâ€™.
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">About Silicon Metabolism and the Nanotechnology Dream</ENAMEX>?
        â€˜One of the striking things about the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana genome is that we can figure out quite a bit from
        it about how this diatom deals with organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>, but it is hard to figure out what it
        is doing with siliconâ€™, admits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rokhsar</ENAMEX>. â€˜The only way we can really figure out what a gene
        is doing is by comparing it with known genes in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, but because diatoms are so
        unique in their use of silicon, we don't have that option. We literally just have the parts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">listâ€™.</ENAMEX>
        To get a hook on which of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000 or so</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is important in silicon metabolism, Sussman
        is using microarrays to investigate how silicon concentrations affect gene expression
        patterns in the diatom. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜There</ENAMEX> may be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> genes whose expression changes in
        response to silicon stressâ€™, he predicts, â€˜and we can then focus on the role that these
        genes play in silicon metabolismâ€™. In another approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hildebrand</ENAMEX> is purifying the
        proteins present in diatom shells. â€˜Once we have isolated these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we can get a
        little bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>, and from there go back to the genome to pull the gene outâ€™,
        he explains.
        In an ideal world, the next step would be to see what effect genetically altering the
        expression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sussman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hildebrand</ENAMEX> has on the silica <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana . Unfortunately, this can't currently be done.
        â€˜The only diatom we can genetically manipulate is 
        Phaeodactylum tricornutum , a pennate diatomâ€™, explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowler</ENAMEX>. 
        P. tricornutum , he says, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜lab ratâ€™</ENAMEX> of the diatom world
        but is much less important ecologically than 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. pseudonana</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowler</ENAMEX> has previously determined the
        size of 
        P. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tricornutum</ENAMEX> 's genome and is now leading a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JGI</ENAMEX> project that
        is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the way through sequencing the 
        P. tricornutum genome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜It</ENAMEX> will be critical to have this second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">genomeâ€™</ENAMEX>, notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rokhsar</ENAMEX>, â€˜because it will highlight what is unique to this group of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, and provide additional help in pulling out silicon metabolism genesâ€™.
        Once the details of silicon metabolism have been revealed, the stage should be set for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nanotechnologists</ENAMEX> to harness diatom <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for the manufacture of nanodevices. â€˜Whether
        we use those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> inside the diatom or in test tubes remains to be seen, but one way or
        another, diatoms are harbouring a secret that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> need to learn aboutâ€™, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sussman</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hildebrand</ENAMEX> agrees, noting how â€˜important it is that materials <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> recognise the
        incredible ability of biology to make structures that could perhaps be incorporated in the
        design of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nanotechnological widgetsâ€™</ENAMEX>.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armbrust</ENAMEX>, it is the ecological insights are coming out of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pseudonana genome sequencing projectâ€”which is part of a
        bigger JGI program on algal genomicsâ€”that are most exciting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜Already</ENAMEX>, multiple little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insights</ENAMEX> are encouraging us to think differently about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diatoms</ENAMEX> perceive their
        environment and survive in it. We have also seen many things we can't figure out at all
        right now. My heart lies in the ecology of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, but if we can generate
        information that leads to spinoffs for nanotechnology, that will be fantasticâ€™, she
        concludes.
