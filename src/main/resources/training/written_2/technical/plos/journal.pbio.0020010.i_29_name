        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> was of a solution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>' ever-voracious demands for space to house paper
        volumes. The idea was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> could save space by removing volumes available in
        electronic format. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> have discarded the volumes digitised in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>, but many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> without the paper volumes have been able to offer their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> access to the
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> has digitised. Paper holdings have not decreased dramatically,
        but electronic holdings have increased. So a space-saving service became an access
        service.
        As an access service, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> is a creation of its time. Understandable though the
        decision to use page images may have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years ago</TIMEX>, future user-friendly access
        requires searching capabilities across full-text, which page images cannot supply.
        Likewise, the decision to digitise the back-runs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 100â€”now 218â</NUMEX>€”paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> was a
        bold decision at the time, but the future for access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> literature lies in
        electronic versions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of titles, both current and
        retrospective. When we reach that point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> will still have a valued place in the
        content on offer, but it is difficult to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> providing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> rather than a few
        hundred titles. Its technical solutions and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> look dated as both
        subscription-based and open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> improve their services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>. As the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> articles accessible over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> increases, JSTOR
        will be seen as a small-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> from which we learned valuable lessons.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Schonfeld</ENAMEX> ends his very detailed description of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> on â€˜Lessons
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Learnedâ€™</ENAMEX>, many of which are relevant to current access initiatives. The need for grant
        funding to launch any such initiative has to be accompanied by a sound business plan to
        ensure long-term economic viability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> has achieved that transition, and its success
        provides a model for others. Much of the credit must go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>'s enterprising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Guthrie</ENAMEX>, who found the quickest way through the maze of conflicting adviceâ€”much of
        which could have resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>'s reaching a deadendâ€”and convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and
        publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> to buy into a product that was only a promise. Meeting user needs
        for easy access to high-quality content was the key to the fulfilment of that promise.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>'s public image is of quality in depthâ€”long runs of core journalsâ€”and that image has
        to become the hallmark of the new open-access initiatives as they develop.
        It is understandable that some mistakes were made on the way. The difficulty that JSTOR
        financial planning had in coming to terms with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">consortial</ENAMEX> purchases delayed its growth as
        an access service. Although selling to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortia</ENAMEX> of academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> may not have
        improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>'s financial position in the short-term, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortia</ENAMEX> are a route to spreading
        access and therefore securing longer-term financial stability (as the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">realised</ENAMEX> through their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜Big Dealsâ€™</ENAMEX> in selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of libraries
        in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX>). Some opportunities were also delayedâ€”not lostâ€”through too slow an
        adaptation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> purchasing model for selling outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> being the exception. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK</ENAMEX> deal was with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JISC</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Information Systems</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils</ENAMEX>, acting more as a negotiating agent
        than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX>, and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> could have been applied in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. More
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> would have valued access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, but the approach to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> deals had
        to be imaginative. For all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, there has to be an understanding of the political,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>, economic, and educational structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into which the product is being
        sold, an understanding that takes time to acquire but that pays dividends. Open-access
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> do not have to sell their product to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, but local
        knowledge is essential in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€˜sellingâ</ENAMEX>€™ their services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. The globalisation of
        publishing has combined with the globalisation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and with the globalisation
        of research to provide opportunities for high-quality research conducted outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> to be published in peer-reviewed open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> more
        readily than in the traditional subscription-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Schonfeld</ENAMEX>'s book draws out many of the significant points about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>'s place in
        the history of electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> through a minute examination of the process leading
        to JSTOR as it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. There is so much detail in the book that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> may feel that
        its comprehensiveness cannot be questioned, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small omission of which I have personal
        knowledge makes me question the value of so much detail. The omission concerns the interest
        by my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">College London</ENAMEX>, in joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JISC</ENAMEX> deal was
        considered. Not a detail of world-shattering significance, but it does illustrate the fact
        that outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, as well as within, the early interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> came from
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> rather than from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortia</ENAMEX>. I sympathise with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Schonfeld</ENAMEX> in
        attempting to write such a comprehensive history, but what is the point of appearing to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> when comprehensiveness is an impossible goal? Would a briefer history have
        been just as valuable?
        Leaving aside quibbles and caveats about the book and about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>, this remains a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fascinating</ENAMEX> and instructive history of an important and ground-breaking initiative. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowen</ENAMEX>'s vision may not have developed in quite the way he expected, but the â€˜bottom-lineâ€™
        is that the vision did become a successful reality. The problem of ever-expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
        has not gone away in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX> was conceived, but the ultimate solutionâ€”the
        availability of electronic contentâ€”has become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">closer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JSTOR</ENAMEX>'s success has encouraged
        others to develop services that are more in accord with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. One lesson <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schonfeld</ENAMEX> does not draw out is the pace of change in electronic publishing, and if so much
        has been achieved since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, what promise is held out by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next ten years</TIMEX>'!
