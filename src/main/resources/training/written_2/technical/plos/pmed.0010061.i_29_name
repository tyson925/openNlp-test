        index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>). In the largest study, a survey on sleep duration and frequency of insomnia in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1.1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> occurred for habitual sleep amounts
        below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7‚</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Äì8 hours</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. A recent prospective study found an association between sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curtailment</ENAMEX> and future weight gain [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The mechanism linking short sleep with weight gain
        is unknown, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mignot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' study in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] adds to the growing evidence implicating leptin and
        ghrelin, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> involved in appetite regulation.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hormones That Regulate Appetite</ENAMEX>
        Leptin, a peptide hormone secreted from white adipocytes, is implicated in the
        regulation of food intake and energy balance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> acts on the central nervous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, in particular the hypothalamus, suppressing food intake and stimulating energy
        expenditure. Leptin production is primarily regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-induced changes in
        adipocyte metabolism‚Äîits secretion levels correlate with adipocyte mass and lipid
        loads.
        Leptin promotes inflammation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> provides an interesting link between obesity
        and pathophysiological processes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> resistance and atherosclerosis, and
        disorders such as autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX>.
        Increased serum leptin levels in obesity and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic syndrome</ENAMEX> support the view that these
        disorders are in fact low-grade systemic inflammatory diseases, characterized by increased
        concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interleukin-6</ENAMEX>, tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leptin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leptin</ENAMEX>'s proinflammatory role suggests that it may link energy homeostasis to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>].<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghrelin</ENAMEX> is a peptide hormone that stimulates appetite, fat production,
        and body growth‚Äîleading to increased food intake and body weight. It is secreted into the
        circulation from the stomach, but is also synthesised in a number of other tissues,
        including the kidney, pituitary, and hypothalamus, suggesting that the hormone has both
        distant and local (endocrine and paracrine) effects. These effects include stimulating the
        secretion of growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>, and a diabetogenic
        effect on carbohydrate metabolism [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Study</ENAMEX>
        In this study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,024</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study</ENAMEX>
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mignot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> found that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> sleeping less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX>, increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        was proportional to decreased sleep [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> also found that shorter sleep
        times were associated with increased circulating ghrelin and decreased leptin, a hormonal
        pattern that is consistent with decreased energy expenditure and increased appetite and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX>.
        These findings confirm earlier clinical reports on the effects of sleep deprivation and
        extend them to include naturalistic sleep in a large, community-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The study
        provides an exciting addition to the growing literature showing relationships between sleep
        curtailment, metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metabolic disorders</ENAMEX> (including obesity). The data have
        important implications for our understanding of obesity and related disorders in the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> caveat: the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was enriched with snorers, making
        the results less applicable to a general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mignot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' data are in accord with human and animal studies that show that
        experimental curtailment of sleep leads to lower levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leptin</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9,10,11</NUMEX>] and increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ghrelin</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. The new study therefore lends some support to the interpretation that reduced
        sleep levels cause the hormonal changes.
        But there is also evidence of opposite effects‚Äîthat is, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of leptin
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] and ghrelin can alter sleep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ghrelin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> has been found to increase non-REM
        sleep in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, possibly via its interactions with the sleep-inducing peptide
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> (GHRH). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghrelin</ENAMEX> is an endogenous ligand of the growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone secretagogue</ENAMEX> receptor, making it a candidate for an endogenous sleep-promoting
        factor [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mignot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' study is congruent with the idea that inadequate sleep
        enhances ghrelin secretion, which in turn acts as an endogenous sleep factor in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
        This is an important new area of research that could conceivably lead to more physiological
        sleep aids than are currently available, with profound implications for improved public
        health.
        Overall, the available studies suggest the presence of reciprocal interactions between
        metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> and sleep, relationships that are poorly understood at present. Does
        sleep interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metabolic hormones</ENAMEX> directly or via intervening factors such as
        sleep-related breathing disorders? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with obstructive sleep apnea have impaired
        sleep and higher ghrelin levels than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>-matched controls, and treatment with continuous
        positive airway pressure reduces ghrelin to control levels [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Although sleep-disordered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breathing</ENAMEX> (SDB) was measured in the present study, the SDB analyses were not shown, making
        it difficult to evaluate the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX> on ghrelin and leptin in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        There is a clear need for well-controlled, population-based studies that allow us to
        examine multiple relevant factors simultaneously. The present study highlights the
        importance of shortened sleep in relation to obesity, leptin, and ghrelin, a good start
        toward this goal.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sleep and Public Health</ENAMEX>
        Many other important questions remain, such as the roles that other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, cytokines,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX> play in obesity. Many of the unanswered questions have important implications for
        public health. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, visceral obesity, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and hyperinsulinemia
        commonly aggregate together in large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, and are considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmetabolic syndrome‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        that has been linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDB</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] and to inflammatory disorders [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. To what extent does
        long-term sleep curtailment contribute to these and related public health issues?
        The possible role of sleep restriction in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders is of
        particular interest in light of recent findings linking immune function with ghrelin and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leptin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghrelin</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> are expressed in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX>, where they can
        inhibit cytokine activation, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and leptin
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Conversely, leptin stimulates cytokine activation and immune-cell proliferation, an
        effect that predisposes to inflammatory conditions [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Is it possible, then, that
        sleep-related changes in leptin and ghrelin influence the development of metabolic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune disorders</ENAMEX>? Can biologically restorative sleep reverse disease progression? Can
        biologically restorative sleep be defined on the basis of metabolic hormone responses?
        Future research may answer some of these and other questions, further elucidating the role
        of sleep in public health.
