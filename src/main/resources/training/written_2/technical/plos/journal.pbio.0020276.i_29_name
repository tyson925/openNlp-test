        and humans‚Äîare now known to share a multitude of molecular, cellular, and developmental
        processes. Not only is there extensive similarity in the sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fly</ENAMEX> and human genes,
        but in addition, almost all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and major signal transduction pathways that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> cell division and differentiation in mammals are also found in the fruitfly 
        Drosophila melanogaster (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubin et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://flybase.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bio</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">indiana</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Components</ENAMEX> in these pathways perform the same biochemical
        functions and act in the same order in both fruitfly and mammalian cells.
        Evolutionary conservation is of considerable practical and theoretical importance to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>. First, it provides a valuable source of data for the reconstruction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salemi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandamme 2003).</ENAMEX> Evolutionary connections between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that were
        once hidden by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX> have now been exposed in genomic analyses. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
        conservation of evolutionary processes or traits is a prime area of investigation in
        theoretical evolutionary biology (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gould</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). What can, and cannot, be changed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evolutionarily</ENAMEX>? In a constantly evolving world, how can any biological system or trait
        survive unchanged (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Valen</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>)? Finally, conservation provides fundamental insights
        into how complex biological systems, such as immunity, are assembled, maintained, and
        altered in evolution.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunity</ENAMEX>
        ‚ÄúInnate‚Äù immunity refers to the variety of physical, cellular, and molecular features
        that provide the first lines of defense against infections. The relatively quick innate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> responses operate along with slower but more targeted adaptive immune responses that
        generate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific mechanisms that eventually lead to the destruction and
        elimination of the pathogen.
        In mammals, the skin and the epithelial lining of the mucosal tissues act as the primary
        nonspecific barriers, impeding infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> from entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. The mucous
        membrane barrier traps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microorganisms</ENAMEX>, and the cilia present on the epithelial cells assist
        in sweeping the microbes towards the external openings of the respiratory and
        gastrointestinal tracts. If infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> gain entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, internal innate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> responses become activated and rapidly eliminate the infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> innate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and responses include (amongst others) low pH of the stomach and vagina,
        proteolytic enzymes and bile in the small intestine, and phagocytosis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phagocytosis</ENAMEX> is a fundamental innate immune mechanism carried out by a number of
        different cell types, including macrophages. Specific macrophage subpopulations are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with different tissues (alveolar macrophages in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX>, microglial cells in
        the central nervous system, etc.). Their main function is to consume microorganisms, other
        foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, and old, dying cells.
        Innate immunity is present from birth, and the information for innate immune responses
        is inherited. Cells in the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">innate</ENAMEX> immune system (e.g., macrophages) detect
        ‚Äúmicrobial nonself‚Äù by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAMPs</ENAMEX>; Janeway
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAMPs</ENAMEX> are products of microbial metabolism that are conserved over evolution,
        distributed in a wide variety of pathogens, and not found in host cells. Lipopolysaccharide
        is an example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAMP</ENAMEX> and is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, viruses, and fungi. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Receptors</ENAMEX>, called
        pattern recognition <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, are present on surfaces of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells and recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAMPs</ENAMEX>.
        When activated, pattern recognition receptors induce intracellular signaling via the
        transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor NF-Œ∫B</ENAMEX>, resulting in the activation of genes involved in host
        defense.
        Adaptive immunity is characterized by greater specificity than innate immunity, as the
        adaptive immune response can not only distinguish foreign cells from self, but can also
        distinguish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> from another. Another hallmark of adaptive immunity is
        memory, which enables the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to remember specific adaptive responses in response to
        specific antigens. Immunological memory allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to make a greater and more rapid
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> response when the body is reinfected by the same pathogen. Immunological memory
        underlies both immunization and resistance to reinfection, conferring a tremendous
        evolutionary advantage to vertebrates. The adaptive immune response has nearly infinite
        flexibility: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> and B lymphocytes of the acquired immune system can rearrange the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of their immunoglobulin and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-cell receptor genes</ENAMEX> to create <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of clones
        with distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen receptors</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> where both innate and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired immune</ENAMEX> systems
        are present, there is a clear interdependence between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systems. For a fully
        functional immune system, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> must act in synergy.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innate Immunity</ENAMEX> in Drosophila
        Because it lacks an adaptive immune response, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">melanogaster</ENAMEX> serves as a wonderful model for studying
        aspects of the innate immune system that might otherwise be obscured by the actions of the
        adaptive immune response. Insects defend themselves against parasites and pathogens by
        invoking a multitude of innate immune responses (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; for more details, see recent
        reviews by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoffmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichhart</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hultmark</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brennan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meister</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theopold et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>]). Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila</ENAMEX> protects itself against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> and parasites via
        epithelial barriers: for example, epithelial cells of the trachea, gut, genital tract, and
        Malpighian tubules produce antimicrobial peptides (local response).
        Once within the body cavity, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> may be consumed by the phagocytic blood cells
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmatocytes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Larger pathogens (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> of parasitic wasps) are
        inactivated by encapsulation, an immune response carried out by specialized cells called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamellocytes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Lamellocytes differentiate in response to macroscopic pathogens,
        and their precursors are thought to reside in the larval lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gland</ENAMEX>. The transcription
        factors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Friend</ENAMEX>-of-GATA, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Runx</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) and signal transduction pathways
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Toll/NF-Œ∫B</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Serrate/Notch</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAK/STAT</ENAMEX>) that are required for specification and
        proliferation of blood cells during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal hematopoiesis</TIMEX>, as well as during the
        hematopoietic proliferation that accompanies immune challenge, are conserved (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evans et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meister 2004).</ENAMEX> In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Crozatier et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) identify the transcription factor
        Collier as being critical for the differentiation of lamellocytes in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . The mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ortholog</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collier</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early B-cell</ENAMEX>
        Factor) is involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B-cell</ENAMEX> differentiation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to triggering cellular immune responses, invading pathogens also activate
        humoral reactions. Microbes induce the rapid secretion of antimicrobial peptides from the
        cells of the fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> into the larval or adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> cavity (systemic response; Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">microbial</ENAMEX> infection initiates a zymogen cascade that plays a crucial role in the activation
        of the antimicrobial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Infection or wounding also triggers a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-cleaving cascade</ENAMEX> that results in the production of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intermediates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX>
        around <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> or wound sites. This proteolytic cascade is similar to the vertebrate
        clotting cascade. 
        Drosophila hemolymph also coagulates and participates in host
        defense and wound healing (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theopold et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Given the evolutionary success
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, this combination of defense mechanisms has proven to be extremely effective,
        allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> to thrive in septic environments.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NF-Œ∫B Activation: The Toll and Imd Pathways of Drosophila</ENAMEX>
        The 
        Drosophila genome encodes several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the multifunctional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toll</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beutler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rehli 2002).</ENAMEX> Mutations in the 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Toll gene</ENAMEX> (as well as in other components in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>) make the fly susceptible to fungal or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX>-positive bacterial infections. However,
        Toll does not act as a pattern recognition <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in the fly; instead its activation
        depends on the presence of the processed (active) form of the growth-factor-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polypeptide Sp√§tzle.</ENAMEX> Processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sp√</ENAMEX>§tzle depends on a serpin-controlled proteolytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        While components of the 
        Drosophila Toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> were identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> genetic
        screens for developmental mutants, those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> have been the focus of more
        recent studies, mainly in the context of 
        Drosophila immunity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoffmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Reichhart</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; Hultmark
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). The effector NF-Œ∫B transcription factor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imd</ENAMEX> pathway is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Relish</ENAMEX>, which upon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> activation is cleaved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dredd</ENAMEX> caspase (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Using a combination of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference approach of silencing gene function and a high-throughput <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture
        assay, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Farrell</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) report the identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        this Imd pathway: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sickie</ENAMEX> is a novel protein required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Relish activation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">repressor 1</ENAMEX> is a novel inhibitor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dredd</ENAMEX> caspase.
        The impressive progress in our understanding of innate immunity in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> is now guiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to explore the immune
        system of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> such as the mosquito, 
        Anopheles gambiae , that spreads human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immune</ENAMEX> responses
        in this mosquito are linked to the elimination of the malarial parasites (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osta et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). A comparison of the immunity-related genes in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anopheles</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila</ENAMEX> reveals the presence of the Toll signaling pathway in
        the mosquito genome, even though there are some differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding pathogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> and signal transduction molecules (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christophides et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). A detailed and
        comparative view of the genetic mechanisms underlying their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host defense</ENAMEX> will contribute to
        the identification of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> for insecticide development, and provide opportunities
        for controlling the transmission of pathogens.
      
      
        Concluding Remarks
        The homologs of many genes involved in innate immune responses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have
        also been found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX>, nematodes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pujol et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; Nurnberger
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brunner 2002).</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> studied to date, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host defense</ENAMEX> appears to be mediated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous proteins</ENAMEX>. Taken together, these findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host defense</ENAMEX> may be hard-wired in the genome much as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> and cell division
        are. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein motifs</ENAMEX>, domains, and signaling elements have, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, not only
        retained their ancestral biochemical features but have also continued to participate in
        similar physiological responses. It is crucial that our evolving knowledge of ‚Äúgenomic
        recycling‚Äù be used to enhance our understanding of the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, not only in the
        context of ‚Äúdescendants of ancient apes,‚Äù but in the larger context of our fundamental
        unity and shared genetic history with all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. This simple but fundamental idea
        has yet to be adopted by the majority of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. Unless we do more to
        overcome resistance to the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> share deep evolutionary connections with all
        animal life, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> will become increasingly isolated from an understanding of, and
        participation in, the genomics and bioinformatics revolution that is transforming the
        biological and biomedical sciences.
