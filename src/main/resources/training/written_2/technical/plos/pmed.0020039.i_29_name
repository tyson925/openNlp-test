  
    
      
        
        There has been a recent and dramatic rise in global funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$2.1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$6.1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], thanks to several new funding mechanisms
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). These funds, coupled with reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> costs, make it feasible to roll out
        antiretroviral therapy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>) even in resource-poor settings. Nevertheless, the total number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> rose in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> to reach its highest level ever: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 39.4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are living with the virus, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9 million</NUMEX> who acquired it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Therefore, the debate over the appropriate distribution of money between prevention
        efforts (such as voluntary counseling and testing [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VCT</ENAMEX>], or behavior change) and treatment
        efforts (the provision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>) is now more topical than ever.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balancing Prevention</ENAMEX> and Treatment
        The scale of the proposed increase in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> raises
        numerous questions about the treatment itself. Which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> will be used? How much will it
        cost? How will their quality be monitored and assured? How will they be distributed? Who
        will be eligible? How will the desired level of treatment be sustained? Is there adequate
        infrastructure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human resources</ENAMEX> to support the expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>?
        The commitment of substantial funding to treatment in resource-poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> also has
        implications for the prevention efforts in those same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. In many Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of the majority of the available data on the subject), the
        impressive drop in mortality due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> following increased access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> is coupled with a
        disheartening rise in the number of new cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, as emphasis and funding are shifted
        from prevention to treatment [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX> in which this pattern has been seen are
        evidence of the pitfalls of failing to adapt prevention efforts once life-extending
        treatment becomes widely available.
        Of course, prevention and treatment are not mutually exclusive. Successful prevention
        efforts mean fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will need the costly drug treatment programs, helping extend
        the sustainability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>. In turn, the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> in prolonging healthy living helps
        prevention efforts by reducing the stigma associated with self-education and responsible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">behaviors</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Measuring Prevention</ENAMEX> and Treatment Effects
        In their study in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2005</TIMEX> issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúIntegrating HIV Prevention</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Treatment: From Slogans</ENAMEX>
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impact,‚Äù Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> use mathematical modeling to assess the epidemiologic
        impact of treatment and prevention efforts, and to quantify the opportunities and potential
        risks of large-scale treatment roll-out. Using a variety of different scenarios, they
        propose methods for establishing the most effective balance between spending on prevention
        and spending on treatment.
        Modeling is a technique used by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, including epidemiologists and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statisticians</ENAMEX>, to create a mathematical equation that can be used to determine which
        variables affect an outcome of interest, and to what extent. Once the influential variables
        are determined, a baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is established that includes those variables and reflects
        their relative importance to the outcome. The effect of changing the value of any of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, or several of them, can then be tested, and new outcomes projected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> modeling
        is inexact and requires far better data but can nevertheless provide important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insights</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> used mathematical modeling to assess the effect of changing
        aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS ‚Äúequation‚Äù</ENAMEX> on the future course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic. First, a
        baseline model was created to fit expected <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> projections for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2020</TIMEX> if there
        were to be no change in the current <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epidemiologic trends‚Äîno ART scale-up</ENAMEX>, and no changes in
        prevention efforts or behavior. Heterosexual contact is the predominant mode of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' study modeled the disease only
        within the heterosexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was also tailored to take into account
        epidemiologic, demographic, and sociologic patterns in the eastern, central/western and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. Using the baseline models tailored to each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>, the effects
        of prevention and treatment efforts were then measured.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> treatment-centered scenarios were tested in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>'s ‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äú3</NUMEX>
        by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5‚</NUMEX>Äù initiative (see <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>) was achieved. In these treatment-centered scenarios, the
        reduction of transmissibility, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and condom use were
        either optimal (reduced transmissibility, reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, and increased condom use) or
        less than optimal. The prevention-centered scenario tested the impact of a comprehensive
        package of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> prevention tools (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VCT</ENAMEX> and peer counseling for sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>), modeling
        only partial effectiveness at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> level, to reflect weaker political and social
        support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> control efforts. Finally, combined response scenarios were tested. In the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> scenario, treatment efforts strengthened prevention efforts as, for example, when the
        availability of ART increases <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s willingness to undergo testing. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, an
        emphasis on treatment led to less effective implementation of prevention efforts.
        Baseline projections in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' study showed that without any behavioral
        change or ART scale-up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> prevalence rate would remain relatively stable, but
        the number of new infections would increase by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52.3 million</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. Treatment-centered
        scenarios reduced the total number of new infections through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> by a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>, while indicating that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> deaths through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> would decline
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">32.4 million</NUMEX>. A prevention-centered strategy would provide greater reductions in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>) and similar mortality reductions by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>, but more modest mortality
        benefits over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five to ten years</TIMEX>.
        The scenarios in which all of these statistics were most improved, however, were those
        that combined both prevention and treatment efforts. In the scenario in which treatment
        enhanced prevention, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> projected <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">29 million</NUMEX> averted infections (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>)
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 million</NUMEX> averted deaths (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX>) through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2020</TIMEX>. However, if a narrow focus on
        treatment scale-up leads to reduced effectiveness of prevention efforts, the benefits of a
        combined response would be considerably smaller‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äî9 million</NUMEX> averted infections (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        million averted deaths (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Combining treatment with effective prevention efforts could reduce the resource needs
        for treatment dramatically in the long term. In the various scenarios the numbers of people
        being treated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.2 million</NUMEX> in a treatment-only scenario with mixed
        effects, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2 million</NUMEX> in a combined response with positive treatment‚Äìprevention
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synergies</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Moving Forward
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have demonstrated through mathematical modeling that the integration of
        treatment and prevention is epidemiologically sound. However, an integrated and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive program</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) is not only logical but makes sense from the service
        delivery point of view: it can be cost-effective and ideal for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
        
        Effective prevention makes treatment more affordable and
        sustainable. Effective prevention can lead to a substantial reduction in the number of
        new infections and therefore ultimately will lead to a reduction in the number of people
        who will need treatment. The reduction of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> prevalence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.5%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX> has reduced the number of those eventually needing treatment
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 68%</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Unless the incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> is sharply reduced, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment will not
        be able to keep pace with all those who will need therapy [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>'
        reaffirmation that only effective prevention will make treatment affordable is critically
        important.
        
        Successful treatment and care can make prevention more acceptable and
        effective. Widespread access to treatment could bring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into
        health-care settings, providing new opportunities for health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to deliver and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">reinforce HIV</ENAMEX> prevention messages and interventions [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Improved access to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> testing
        provides an entry point to both prevention and treatment services and provides a unique
        opportunity to identify and target the infected, vulnerable, and uninfected with more
        appropriate interventions. All health-care settings, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, should
        deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> prevention services [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        
        Prevention can make treatment more accessible. The early establishment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">community-based</ENAMEX> prevention services in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghana</ENAMEX> was instrumental in reducing the stigma
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and improving the knowledge and attitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> prior to the development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VCT</ENAMEX> services (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Torpey</ENAMEX>, personal communication). This process also made it
        easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and implementing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to identify and refer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> needing
        treatment services.
        
        Expanded care and prevention activities have synergistic
        effects. Continued effective treatment, care, and prevention programs will reduce the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orphans</ENAMEX> and vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to child transmission of the
        virus, and improve the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and the strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
        
        Integration ensures that prevention activities are not neglected. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX> has a unique opportunity, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> services are launched and expanded, to
        simultaneously bolster prevention efforts [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Experience in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> indicates
        that availability of treatment can lead to increased risk behavior [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. In addition, the
        improvement in the health, well-being, and longevity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> could
        increase the opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV transmission</ENAMEX>. Integration can help reduce these
        potential negative impacts of treatment.
        
        Integration can provide opportunities to address vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> more
        effectively. A commitment to providing large-scale treatment helps to focus attention
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> at greatest risk, particularly in lower prevalence contexts. This provides
        an opportunity to address the prevention and treatment needs of vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> more
        effectively.
        
        Treatment resources can help improve infrastructure for prevention and other
        health services. The training of health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and improvements in laboratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, pharmacy, logistics, commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and health information systems can
        benefit both treatment and prevention services. Further, in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, a large number
        of health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are themselves infected. Treatment can help to preserve the lives
        and productivity of these critically needed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> prevention and treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, as well
        as those of other health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.
        
        A long-term decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> deaths may be preventing new infections. The
        short-term decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> deaths is driven by effective care and treatment programs, but a
        long-term decline may be driven by the prevention of new infections. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> strategies are more likely to lead to affordable, sustainable programs.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> requires dramatic expansion of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> and prevention. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Globally,</ENAMEX>
        fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at high risk of infection have access to proven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        prevention interventions [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> have access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Unless there is a
        substantial increase in commitment and resources for both prevention and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ART</ENAMEX>, efforts to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control HIV</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and mitigate its impact will only meet with partial and limited success.
        In addition, to increase resources, intensified commitment is required to ensure every
        opportunity is taken to integrate prevention and treatment. Future analysis and debate
        should move from comparisons of prevention and treatment priorities to a sustained analysis
        of how we can reciprocally integrate and strengthen prevention and care and use every
        opportunity provided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to reinforce the other. We must focus on the development of
        training, monitoring, and quality assurance systems that ensure that prevention and care
        are integrated whenever possible.
        
        The results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' model need to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">validated</ENAMEX>. Further operational research is needed to validate the findings of this
        study.
