        chronometry, which has origins that date back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a century</TIMEX>, seeks to measure the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course of mental operations in the human nervous system [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the late 1800s</TIMEX> until
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, the field was built almost entirely around a single method: measuring and comparing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s reaction times during simple cognitive tasks. As far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>, Franciscus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donders</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] subtracted the time taken to make a single response to an unvarying
        stimulus‚Äîwhat he called an instructed reflex‚Äîfrom the time it took to make the same
        response to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> events, obtaining the time required to discriminate between the two
        stimuli. Further, he subtracted the time to discriminate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stimuli from a situation in
        which there were also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible responses in order to obtain the time required for
        choice.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, studies of reaction time were combined with the then-developing
        mathematical theory of information [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] to address issues such as the maximum transmission
        rate of the human nervous system [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and how coding in the brain of stimuli and their
        responses could influence these limits [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. These studies revealed that reaction time alone
        was not sufficient to elucidate the exact processes by which the brain achieved the human
        ability to process information. However, when combined with other methods, the latency of
        responding can help connect brain studies to the behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> in real situations.
        Recording the average event-related electrical potentials from scalp electrodes became a
        research tool in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, with the advent of analog and then digital computers to
        accomplish the recording and averaging. It became clear that components of the
        event-related potential could be systematically related to sensory and motor stages of
        information processing. For instance, a visual stimulus was found to evoke a short-latency
        scalp response from the primary visual cortex at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 60 milliseconds</TIMEX>, followed by
        positive and negative voltage changes in neighboring visual areas. Similarly, scalp
        recorded potentials from the frontal cortex could be recorded in relation to motor
        activity. It was now possible to observe some of the sensory and motor stages that were
        inferred from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donders</ENAMEX>'s subtractive method (see [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] for a review).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Sternberg</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] developed a much-improved method for dividing reaction time into
        successive or serial stages, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> factors method. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were asked to
        determine whether or not a probe digit had been present in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just</NUMEX> previously presented
        series of digits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sternberg</ENAMEX> argued that the time to complete the task could be divided into
        a sensory stage, dependent on stimulus parameters such as the intensity or clarity of the
        probe; a comparison stage, dependent only on the number of items in memory; and a response
        stage that reflected the difficulty of the specified response. Factors that influenced one
        stage (e.g., stimulus intensity) would be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> with those that influenced another stage
        (e.g., motor output). With this simple framework, it was now possible to determine at which
        stage(s) a new factor (e.g., nicotine, sleep deprivation, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX>) had its
        influence.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>, the advent of microelectrode recordings of single neurons from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized monkeys</ENAMEX> allowed for an even finer resolution of neurophysiological processes
        and seemed to provide support for the view that the brain does indeed process information
        in serial stages. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiesel</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] argued that successive levels of the visual system
        could be seen as accomplishing successive analyses of input. The microelectrode strategy
        was quickly adopted to alert <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, making it apparent that higher level brain areas
        involved in operations upon input might feedback their influences on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> processing
        stages [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,10</NUMEX>]. These control systems, often called attention, posed something of a problem
        for completely serial views of information processing. However, they also provided evidence
        of localized brain areas within the parietal lobe of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> that could be
        systematically related to processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> involved in attention‚Äîwhich were then being
        investigated by mental chronometry in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with parietal and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neuroimaging</ENAMEX> experiments made possible the examination of activity in
        localized brain areas, first through the use of injected radionuclides detected by positron
        emission tomography (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PET</ENAMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and later through the use of an externally imposed magnetic
        field in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last ten years</TIMEX>, fMRI
        has improved in spatial and temporal resolution and can now provide evidence of quite
        specific brain areas, in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">millimeter</NUMEX> range, that are involved in cognitive tasks. Most
        studies have shown a small number of widely distributed brain areas that must be
        orchestrated to carry out a cognitive task. Although, as in all sciences, there are
        disagreements, the convergence of results in areas of attention and language seem to me
        particularly impressive.
        When the fMRI method for localization is brought together with methods that can
        accurately measure timing of the same activity (i.e., electrical or magnetic event-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potentials</ENAMEX>) they can provide considerable insight into the nature of thought. Consider the
        simple task of deciding whether a presented digit is above or below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Dehaene
        argued that the task could be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stages. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> involves obtaining the
        identity of the probe input (encoding), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> making a comparison against the stored
        representation of the digit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> selecting a response, and lastly, checking the
        output for error. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive factor</ENAMEX> theory, a variable that effects overall
        reaction time by varying the time to complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> with the effects
        of variables that affect other stages. The input or encoding stage was varied by using
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> or spelled digits (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú3‚</NUMEX>Äù or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúthree‚Äù</ENAMEX>). The comparison stage was varied by
        comparing digits close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>) with those far from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>). The
        response <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> was varied by specifying a response from either the dominant or non-dominant
        hand and error monitoring was examined by comparing error with correct trials. Each of
        these variables influenced only the appropriate stage and was <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> in its effect with
        each of the other variables (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Moreover, scalp-recorded, event-related potentials showed a separate scalp distribution
        and latency for each variable [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Subsequent fMRI data has confirmed and increased the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of the anatomy proposed for each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>.
        Of course, not all human activities involve a set of exhaustive and independent serial
        stages that can be shown to add up to the overall reaction time. While tasks like the
        number comparison discussed above can be usefully divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> may
        deal with simultaneous operations and may be limited only by a total capacity of central
        mechanisms. We know that many situations involve parallel processing and feedback loops at
        many levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sternberg</ENAMEX> has attempted to apply a modified version of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive factor</ENAMEX> theory
        to brain systems using neuroimaging that allows for some of these possibilities
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,16</NUMEX>].
        Laboratory studies often use the simultaneous execution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different tasks (dual
        tasks) to simulate the more realistic situations where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> time-share activities. In
        this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Sigman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dehaene</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] provide a model that further
        extends the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive factor</ENAMEX> logic to the dual task situation. They propose that for tasks
        that can be broken down into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive stages‚</TIMEX>Äîperception, decision based on noisy
        integration of evidence, and response‚Äîthe perceptual and motor stages can operate both
        simultaneously with and independently of stages of another task and are thus easily
        amenable to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive factor</ENAMEX> analysis. The decision stage, however, appears to represent a
        kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcognitive bottleneck‚Äù</ENAMEX> for which the reaction times of the two tasks become
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interdependent</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> adds considerably to the range of situations to which an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
        factor approach can be applied, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to seek more information about how
        new variables influence hidden processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX>.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognitive</ENAMEX> and emotional tasks studied with neuroimaging have implicated a small
        number of brain areas that are consistently active. Mental chronometry plays a role in
        suggesting the cognitive operations that each of these areas performs and how they are
        organized in real time. The toolkit of new techniques provides the basis for further tests
        to evaluate whether a chronometric model reveals a crucial set of connected computations
        (circuit) for carrying out the task. For example, using a magnetic pulse delivered outside
        the skull, it is now possible to induce a reversible lesion at the time of a particular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">computation</ENAMEX> to determine whether the specific computation assigned to a given area is truly
        needed to carry out the task. Studies using diffusion tensor imaging can examine whether
        there are large-scale connections between neural areas posited by a particular model. In
        describing the links between brain and behavior, mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronometry</ENAMEX> is still a cornerstone
        that binds psychology to the techniques of neuroscience.
