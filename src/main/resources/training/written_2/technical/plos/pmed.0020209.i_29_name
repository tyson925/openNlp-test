  
    
      
        
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A year ago</TIMEX>, I received an E-mail from a research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> at a major pharmaceutical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> had read my articles on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whistleblowers</ENAMEX> who had raised concerns about
        the undue influence of the pharmaceutical industry on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> My industry source
        had information for me about drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> practices, butâ€”out of fear of career ruinâ€”would
        only talk on the condition that I would conceal the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>'s identity.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year or so</TIMEX>, I had repeated contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>. As I listened to
        this researcherâ€”and to the other medical whistleblowers that I continued to interviewâ€”it
        occurred to me that each whistleblower was like the proverbial blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a hand on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>. Each could describe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece of the puzzle, but the full picture could only
        emerge by bringing these whistleblowers together.
        With an eye to focusing on the systemic problems that have allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> to
        be unduly influenced by industry, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 15, 2005</TIMEX>, I brought together <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> whistleblowers
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> C. I asked them each to tell their story and to suggest ways to restore
        objectivity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and medical research.
      
      
        The Whistleblowers
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whistleblowers</ENAMEX> attended in person, and the anonymous industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>
        participated via speakerphone. The whistleblowers came from an extraordinary variety of
        different professional backgrounds.
        
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Graham</ENAMEX>
            This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>) safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> raised concerns about the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiovascular</ENAMEX> side effects of rofecoxib (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vioxx</ENAMEX>) and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. He
            testified at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> hearing on rofexocib, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>,
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> attended the roundtable in his own personal capacity and was
            not representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>.
            
              Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whistleblower</ENAMEX> was like the proverbial blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with a hand on the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Jones</ENAMEX>
            This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> led an
            investigation into an off-the-books account, funded in part by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, from
            which payments were made to state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to develop a medication treatment
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX>. He filed a civil rights lawsuit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Office of the</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> to protect his right to publicly discuss his findings, and was later

            This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX> was hired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Program Integrity</ENAMEX> in
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Public Welfare</ENAMEX> to oversee the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s mental health and

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, charging that he was fired after uncovering widespread abuse

            This former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drug representative</ENAMEX> left the pharmaceutical industry after witnessing
            marketing practices that she found disturbing. She wrote and directed the movie

            Ties between drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> and industry may influence new drug approval
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Graham</ENAMEX> described the frustrations he had felt in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 20 years</TIMEX> of
            experience as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">safety officer</ENAMEX>. Although he was instrumental, he said, in
            getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> off the market because of safety concerns, his experience was like a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon swimming upstreamâ€”â€œa single individualâ€</ENAMEX>¦against the tide.â€ The tide, he said, â€œis
            an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> whose mission is to approve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and make industry happy.â€
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>, is in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œcollaborative relationshipâ€</ENAMEX> with industry. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>
            gets money from drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992</ENAMEX> (see
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fda</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/cber/pdufa.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX>) â€œto approve new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and approve them more
            quickly.â€ The mindset at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>, he said, is that â€œwe will find a reason to approve a
            drug no matter how small the indication for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Graham</ENAMEX> explained that a senior
            official at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> had told him: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œindustry is our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>.â€œ
            When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> knows there is a serious problem with a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, he said, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>
            deals with this by saying, â€œwell, we'll handle it in labelingâ€ even though, said
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham, â€œFDA</ENAMEX> knows labeling doesn't work.â€
            â€œThere is no independent voice for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> safety in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,â€ he said. The
            upper-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Drug Safety</ENAMEX> are appointed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Drugs</ENAMEX>, which approves new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>. This makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Drug Safety</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œcaptive</ENAMEX>,â€ he said, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of New Drugs</ENAMEX>.
            The anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> said that in order to speed up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> approval, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
            â€œdon't measure things like whether we are really curing the disease, or prolonging
            life, or preventing hospitalization, or whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is truly more functional.
            Oftentimes, we're measuring intermediate, lesser things, markers, predictorsâ€”we 
            hope â€”of these clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">endpoints</ENAMEX>, but they may or may not be
            accurate.â€
            And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, requires just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positive studies to grant
            approval to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, but there is no limitation on how many negative studies can be
            done before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> positive studies are produced. This can lead to approval of a
            drug even when most studies are negative or show no effect.
            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> and the anonymous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> suggested putting an end to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prescription</ENAMEX>
            Drug <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">User Fee Act</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> argued that there needs to be independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> for
            those in charge of drug safety. They indicated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bills in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, introduced
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grassley</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinchey</ENAMEX>, at least partly address these
            concerns.
            â€œThe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pharmaâ€“FDA complex</ENAMEX> has to be dismantled,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>, â€œand the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> people
            have to insist on that, otherwise we're going to have disasters like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vioxx</ENAMEX> that happen
            in the future.â€
          
        
        
          
          
            The race to approve new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> without proper safety testing may be compromising
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>'s health
            â€œDrug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> assiduously avoid acquiring information about side effects,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said
            the industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>. â€œDrug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will not conduct safety studies unless they
            have toâ€”meaning basically that they're required by a regulatorâ€”and that rarely
            happens.<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€ High-risk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who might have a bad reaction to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, said the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, â€œare excluded from studies deliberately, even though, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is
            approved, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will be targeted for sales.â€ When a safety study is proposed
            within the industry, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, â€œa typical response will be that if we
            conducted a study to find out if there was a safety problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would learn about
            it and think we 
            had a problem [which] would destroy the image of safety that has been
            so carefully constructed.â€
            
              â€œThere is no independent voice for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> safety in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.â€
            
            Studies are too small and are conducted over too brief a period to properly assess
            safety: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œThe largest studiesâ€”the phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies, [which] might be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX>
            peopleâ€”last for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> kill one in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several thousand</NUMEX> per year, this
            would be a public health catastrophe. A blockbuster <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> with that kind of hazard
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with it could be associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of deaths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, and it
            would never be detected in studies of the kind that we routinely submit and are the
            basis for approval.â€ These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, and these kinds of risks, are
            â€œessentially out there now, unlabeled, unnoticed, all beneath the radar.â€
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> said that, â€œto ensure that safety problems will go unnoticed, we
            compound the problem of conducting small studies by setting a statistical threshold for
            acknowledging the safety problem that is so high that you know in advance it could
            never be reached for any serious side effect, like myocardial infarction.â€ This
            practice, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, â€œvirtually ensures that if a bad side effect happens to
            show up, it's not going to reach the arbitrary level that we call statistically
            significant, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> can maintain that it's just bad luck.â€ And if a bad result
            does happen, â€œtypically a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is not going to publish the study at all. If they do
            publish it, the bad result can be omitted as â€˜not statistically important.â€™â€
          
        
        
          
          
            The funding of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> by industry may be affecting prescribing
            patterns
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Jones</ENAMEX> described how he believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were acting at the state
            level to influence the prescribing of psychiatric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œI</ENAMEX> began to investigate an account into which pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were paying
            money that was being accessed by state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>,â€ he said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œAdditionally</ENAMEX>, I found that
            various pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were paying state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> directlyâ€”also giving them
            trips, perks, lavish meals, transportation, honorariums <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $2,000</NUMEX> for speaking in
            their official capacities at drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> events. They were given unrestricted
            educational grants that were deposited into an off-the-books accountâ€”unregistered,
            unmonitored, literally operated out of a drawer.â€
            These same state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, he said, were responsible for dictating clinical policy
            and writing guidelines for the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>. These
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were, he said, receiving money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> with a stake in the guidelines.
            â€œThe protocol they [the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>] were developing was called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Medication</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algorithm Project</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMAP</ENAMEX>, which began in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-90s</TIMEX>. It outlined detailed
            medication guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, and bipolar disorder. It
            recommends almost exclusive usage of newer, patented, very expensive atypical
            antipsychotics, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSRIs</ENAMEX> [selective serotonin uptake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>], and mood stabilizers.â€
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Medication Algorithm</ENAMEX> Project, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>, was based on â€œexpert consensusâ€
            from industry-supported meetings.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said that when he wanted to investigate these findings, he was shut down. â€œI
            was told point black, â€˜Look, drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> write checks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>, they write
            checks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> on both sides of the aisleâ€”back off.â€™â€ He was told, he said, to
            â€œquit being a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX>, quit swimming against a stream.â€ He wouldn't back down from his
            investigation, he said, and was demoted. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 22, 2002</TIMEX>, he filed a civil rights
            lawsuit â€œto preserve my job and my right to speak out.â€ His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>, he said, took him
            off investigative duties altogether.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stefan Kruszewski</ENAMEX>, who has filed a law suit in a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
            raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Public Welfare</ENAMEX> about
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prescribing</ENAMEX> practices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that he did not feel were evidence based, and said
            he lost his job for raising his concerns. For example, he alerted his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> to the
            off-label prescribing of the anticonvulsant gabapentin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurontin</ENAMEX>) for mood disorders
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">addictive disorders</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œThe</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical industry is the single most powerful lobbying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillâ€”outspending</ENAMEX> even the oil and banking industries,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>. â€œIt should come as
            no surprise that the ties go far beyond just the mental health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who wrote the
            guidelines, but extend to many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, allowed an
            investigation into pharma corruption to be dropped, and the investigatorâ€”meâ€”to be
            fired.â€
            Efforts to detect and deter fraud and abuse due to these conflicts, he said, â€œwill
            be likely to be undermined as long as those charged with detecting fraud and abuse,
            like the [<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX>, are appointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> who are
            themselves beholden to the drug industry. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> should instead be filled by
            career civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> and not political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointees</ENAMEX>.â€
          
        
        
          
          
            Regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are not being held accountable
            In comments that echoed his testimony to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>
            said that, â€œFDA was the single greatest obstacle to doing anything effective with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vioxx</ENAMEX>. As a result, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 60,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> probably died from that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. That's as many
            of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> that were killed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX> [who] died as a result of Vioxx
            use. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> had the opportunity, the responsibility, to stop that and didn't. In fact,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> allowed it to continue. In my book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> shares in the responsibility for those
            deaths and yet it's not being held accountable by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Congress</ENAMEX> itself, added
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>, is deeply beholden to the drug industry since many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> receive <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œoften
            quite a bit of campaign contributionsâ€ from the industry.
            Kruszewski reflected upon the problems he said he had encountered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
            saying that â€œthere is no accountability in the system for oversight [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>].â€ He has
            become â€œa stronger advocate than ever for a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> bill of rights.â€
          
        
        
          
          
            Marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> can influence doctorsâ€™ prescribing habits
            The research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> said that the job was attractive because of the â€œmany
            excellent drugsâ€ developed, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> â€œalso saw
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> marketed in a way that will exaggerate the benefits and conceal the risks.â€
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Slattery-Moschkau</ENAMEX> gave an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insider</ENAMEX>'s view of drug marketing practices, from
            her former experiences as a drug rep. She clutched her head in disbelief as she told
            the roundtable that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> would come up to her with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' charts asking her for
            advice on treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Slattery-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moschkau</ENAMEX>, like most of the drug representatives
            she came to know over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, had no science background at all.
            
              â€œDrug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> assiduously avoid acquiring information about side effects.â€
            
            The various techniques drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> were trained in to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œeducate doctorsâ€
            eventually proved to be not just â€œcomicalâ€ but â€œalso scary,â€ she said. â€œWhether it was
            hiring, training, what we were told to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and what we were told not to
            say,â€ it was marketing, not science, that dominated. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the techniques used by drug
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> was to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>' prescribing records so drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> knew â€œto the
            dimeâ€ what <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> were prescribing and could tailor their marketing to them.
            Drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> developed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œpersonality profilesâ</ENAMEX>€ on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and were taught to
            pitch their sales to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality types</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> were compensated, she
            said, by â€œhow many prescriptions we could encourage.â€
            Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slattery-Moschkau</ENAMEX> and the industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> described tensions within drug
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> between marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>. â€œThe marketing spin on
            things,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, â€œcarries <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.â€
          
        
        
          
          
            The published medical literature contains many biases
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œWhen</ENAMEX> studies are published,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, â€œthey are frequently written not
            by the trained research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, who might have designed and analyzed the study, but
            by a designated medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> with little if any background in research, but who is
            trained instead to craft the findings of the study in the best possible way for the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.â€
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of literature available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, â€œis a biased
            sample of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> want <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to see.â€ The research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> described â€œa
            culture of secrecy,â€ which makes it hard even for industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> tasked with
            ensuring drug safety to obtain the full datasets needed to genuinely understand a
            drug's riskâ€“benefit profile.
          
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Whistleblowers have been compared to beesâ€”they have just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sting to use and using it
        may lead to career suicide [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Many of the whistleblowers at the roundtable said they had
        experienced retaliation from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> for raising concerns, but all had felt
        obligated to speak out about practices in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and medical research that they believe
        are risking the public's health or safety. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> said he felt â€œtrapped by the truthâ€ and
        had to act. â€œThere are bigger issues here,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kruszewski</ENAMEX>. â€œI felt right from the start
        [that] if I wallowed in self-pity about being fired and having my belongings piled in the
        gutter that I would never understand why all these things were happening. The bigger issue
        is that we've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the pharmaceutical industry and the health-care industry all
        acting in synchrony.â€
        Each of these whistleblowers, in very different waysâ€”from making a satiric film to
        speaking out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Congressâ</ENAMEX>€”has shone light on how this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œsynchronyâ€</ENAMEX> may be compromising the
        integrity of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. We should not have to rely on medical whistleblowers to
        alert us to these fault lines. If we are to restore objectivity to drug development,
        prescribing, and safety monitoring, we must be willing to examine and change all of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that allow this synchrony to occur.
