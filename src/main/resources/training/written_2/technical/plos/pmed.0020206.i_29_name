  
    
      
        
        As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist subspecializing</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> at a respected academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, I (DH)
        assumed that I knew everything I needed to know about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX>.
        I was wrong.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September of 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lester</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Neurology</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Hospital</ENAMEX>, showed me an online bulletin board for neurology patients
        that he had created [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. In reading through the online messages, I observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with neurological diseases sharing their experiences and discussing their problems
        with one another.
        I knew that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> had been making use of online medical
        information [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Nonetheless, I was shocked, fascinated, and more than a bit confused by
        what I saw. I'd been trained in the old medical school style: my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> had insisted
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could not be trusted to understand or manage complex medical matters.
        Thinking back through my years of training and practice, I realized that there had always
        been an unspoken prohibition against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> getting together. I had the
        uncomfortable sense that by promoting interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-emphasizing the
        central role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, I might be violating some deep taboo.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Remarkably Complex Stories</ENAMEX>
        My initial doubts notwithstanding, I found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of well-informed, medically competent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> sharing information on a variety of topics. I was especially struck by the many
        stories recounting the development of a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s efforts
        to manage it, and the resulting interactions with health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. By telling their
        stories in such elaborate detail, experienced group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> could offer a great deal of
        useful advice and guidance to those newly diagnosed, based on what they had learned in
        their own online research, what they had been told by their clinicians, and what they had
        deduced from personal experiences with the disease.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpatient stories‚Äù</ENAMEX> often included a number of empowering elements that set them
        apart from the advice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> typically receive from their clinicians: role modeling by an
        active, critical, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">well-informed ‚Äúexpert patient‚Äù</ENAMEX> ([<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://patientweb.</ENAMEX>net), comparative
        reviews and recommendations of clinicians and treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2‚Äì5</NUMEX>], and advice about
        how to handle the practical details of living with a chronic illness [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] (such as how to
        organize a home medical record, manage treatment side effects, find the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> prices,
        and deal with less-than-perfect health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider systems</ENAMEX>, and
        a wide variety of other topics relating to effective medical self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>). These
        extended patient narratives‚Äîno <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alike‚Äîthus</ENAMEX> gave rise to an accumulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of what my
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and I began to think of as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert patient</ENAMEX> knowledge base. We concluded that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> narratives could be invaluable resources for clinicians and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>,
        interested in taking an in-depth look at the changing roles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and clinicians in
        the Internet age.
        The constant outpouring of sympathy and support that we observed in interactions among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">members</ENAMEX> surpassed anything a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> might conceivably expect to receive at a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rockefeller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Commons Institute</ENAMEX>, has
        suggested, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>-specific online patient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> provide their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with an
        invaluable type of around-the-clock support that he has called the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúchicken soup</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internet‚Äù</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        Working with several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, I initiated an observational study to analyze the ways
        in which E-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were using this new medium. Since I am an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>, we
        decided to focus on an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at the site <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lester</ENAMEX> had created, BrainTalk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">braintalk</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BrainTalk Communities</ENAMEX> currently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> free online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> for neurological conditions (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson disease</ENAMEX>, chronic pain, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huntington</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> across the globe. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> visit the BrainTalk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities</ENAMEX>' Web site on a regular basis. This site is now owned and operated by an
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nonprofit group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BrainTalk Communities</ENAMEX>, and is no longer formally associated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts General Hospital</ENAMEX>.
        What we found surprised us. We assumed that most interactions would be support related,
        with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> describing their medical experiences and others offering active
        listening, sympathy, and understanding. But while such interactions were an important part
        of the group process, they were observed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 30%</NUMEX> of the postings. In the
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the postings, group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> provided each other with what amounted to a
        crash course in their shared disease, discussing topics such as the anatomy, physiology,
        and natural history of the disorder; treatment options and management guidelines for each
        form of treatment; and treatment side effects, medical self-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, the day-to-day
        practicalities of living with the disease, and the effects of their condition on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Source of Information</ENAMEX>
        Much of the information that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> was similar to what I
        routinely provided to my own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. So I was surprised to learn that many of the
        clinicians caring for group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> provided considerably less information, guidance, and
        support. And some, apparently, provided none at all. Statements such as ‚ÄúMy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> is too
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">busy,‚Äù ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúMy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> doesn't care,‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúMy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> doesn't seem to know about
        such-and-such‚Äù were alarmingly common. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' posts spontaneously
        mentioned that they had been unable to get the medical information that they needed from
        their own clinicians. When we surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> directly, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 30%</NUMEX> said that they had
        been unable to obtain all the medical information they would have liked from their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This was a primary reason for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' participation in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>.
        Some other types of information, especially practical tips for living with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> and
        the social aspects of the disease, went far beyond what I had been providing for my own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. I am a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>-certified <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most highly respected
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, yet I learned a great deal about these topics from
        the support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. I now share many of the things I learned from group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with my
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BrainTalk Communities epilepsy</ENAMEX> support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that we observed was facilitated by
        volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> moderators, with little or no professional input. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 6%</NUMEX> of the
        postings contained information that some of our medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> considered at least
        partly mistaken, misinterpreted, outdated, or incomplete. We observed that other group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> frequently corrected such misinformation. And group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> appeared to
        understand that they should not take uncorroborated statements as hard facts. They seemed
        well aware that some postings were erroneous, and in fact seemed to substantially
        overestimate the incidence of questionable materials.
        We observed no serious problems as a result of these questionable postings, and saw many
        reports by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had obtained better care, prevented medical mistakes, or averted
        serious injury because of the information and advice they received from fellow group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. We concluded that, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferguson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frydman</ENAMEX> have suggested, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> have
        seriously overestimated the risks and underestimated the benefits of online support groups
        and other online health resources for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, probably because they do not operate within
        our familiar professionally centered constructs [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        What I've Learned
        In retrospect, the most important thing I (DH) have learned from our online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> want to know about, and in most cases are perfectly capable of understanding
        and dealing with, everything their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> knows about their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and its treatments.
        After observing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, I realized that I had been providing my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a very
        limited subset of what I knew about their condition. Today, there is nothing that I know
        about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> that I would hesitate to share with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. For example, I now offer my
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> an open and frank discussion of the very rare sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. I had previously not mentioned this rare but alarming complication, fearing that
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> might become overly concerned with it. But once I discovered that BrainTalk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities group members</ENAMEX> discussed this topic quite openly and freely online, reviewing
        the scientific data in a sophisticated way, I began to share my knowledge on this topic
        with my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. My newfound frankness has been much appreciated. And none of my
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have become unduly troubled by these discussions.
        I have also learned that an online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BrainTalk Communities epilepsy</ENAMEX> group
        is not only much smarter than any single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, but is also smarter, or at least more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, than many physicians‚Äîeven many medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. While some postings do
        contain erroneous material, online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who share an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> engage in a
        continuous process of self-correction, challenging questionable statements and addressing
        misperceptions as they occur. And while no single resource, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, should be
        considered the last word in medical knowledge, the consensus opinion arrived at by patient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> is usually quite excellent. And if more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> clinicians offered to consult
        informally with the online support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> devoted to their medical specialties‚Äîas I now
        do‚Äîwe could help group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> make information and opinion shared in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> even
        better.
        I had been taught to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could only be ‚Äúempowered‚Äù by their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinicians</ENAMEX>. And while I do believe that clinicians can help in this regard by sharing their
        knowledge openly and by encouraging patient self-reliance, it now seems quite clear that
        growing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are perfectly capable of empowering themselves, with or without
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinician</ENAMEX>'s blessing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> and other health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> should do all they
        can to support them in this worthy effort.
        As a result of what we've learned from these online patient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, our research group
        has developed a password-protected Web site, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PatientWeb</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">https://fisher.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mgh</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harvard</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/</ENAMEX>),
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that we see in the clinic‚Äîall those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX> who receive
        medical care at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts General Hospital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women's Hospital</ENAMEX>. Thanks
        to what we have learned from these online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, we plan to pilot new ways for private,
        local online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the same disease and receiving care from the
        same clinicians to collaborate with each other, and with their clinicians, more
        effectively.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Clinicians have overestimated the downsides, while seriously underestimating the
        benefits, of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>-specific online patient support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. These free online
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> now provide invaluable services <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours a day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days a week</TIMEX>, for patients
        across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and around the world. It would be unfortunate indeed if medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> let their uneasiness at this emerging trend toward patient empowerment and
        autonomy cloud their ability to assess the impressive benefits these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> provide.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are now ready, willing, and able to take a more active role in their own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, and the care of others with related <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. By encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to do more for
        themselves and for each other, clinicians can help mitigate many of the negative effects of
        contemporary time-pressured medical practice. Thus, even though there may now be less time
        for the counseling, storytelling, support, information sharing, and empowerment-based
        training that was once a routine part of the typical office visit, we can now help our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> obtain such services by referring them to online patient networks.
        The distributed expertise of online support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is by no means limited to the
        emotional aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and to the practical logistics of living with the
        disorder. It can also include current reviews of the literature, reports from the latest
        medical meetings, accounts of behind-the-scenes activities at the best treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>,
        sophisticated guidance on dealing with medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, and excellent advice on
        dealing with complex aspects of medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, I have concluded that few, if any, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> could have created a system like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BrainTalk Communities</ENAMEX>. As a tech-savvy non-physician intimately familiar with both the
        inner workings of medical care and the power of information technology systems to create
        effective online <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lester</ENAMEX> was less proprietary than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are
        about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>'s proper professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">‚Äúturf</ENAMEX>.‚Äù He was also less inhibited by professional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biases</ENAMEX> regarding the potential value of the medical contributions that ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> might make. This is not an isolated occurrence. We suspect that the intensely
        professionally centered enculturation most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> receive in their training and
        practice environments may render them, in the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Seely Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Draguld</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúblinkered</ENAMEX> if not blind‚Äù to the emergence of many promising new technocultural changes,
        which currently present new opportunities for health-care innovation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        who seek to innovate in these areas might benefit greatly‚Äîas I have‚Äîfrom joining forces
        with Web <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, Net-savvy social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> unencumbered by the limiting belief systems that may result from our traditional
        medical training.
        In light of their empowering social dynamics and volunteer economics, we suspect that
        patient-led online <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> may prove to be a considerably more promising and sustainable
        health-care resource than professionally moderated therapy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. And we are convinced
        that networked work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> linking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, caregivers, and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> will be
        an important model for future health-care innovation.
