        the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) causes accumulation of the glycolipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glucocerebroside</ENAMEX> in macrophages throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. In the viscera, glucocerebroside
        arises mainly from the biodegradation of red and white blood cells. In the brain,
        glucocerebroside arises from the turnover of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> lipids during brain development and
        the formation of the myelin sheath of nerves. The disease may be discovered as an
        incidental finding in the elderly because of mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thrombocytopenia</ENAMEX> or splenomegaly, or it
        may present early in life with hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>, and bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>.
        Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, treatment consisted only of palliative measures such as splenectomy and hip
        replacement. The development of enzyme replacement therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Gaucher disease</ENAMEX>, that is,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the missing enzyme, is a triumph of translational medicine. At
        the same time, powerful commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> may have been influential in physicians
        adopting a high-dose rather than a low-dose treatment schedule. Moreover, the high cost of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme</ENAMEX> replacement therapy forces us to consider what society can afford in the way of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">palliative</ENAMEX> treatments for very rare <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">History of Enzyme Replacement Therapy</ENAMEX>
        The possibility that the therapeutic replacement of enzymes missing from lysosomes could
        be achieved was first raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Duve forty</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when he wrote: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúAny substance</ENAMEX> that
        is taken up intracellularly by an endocytic process is likely to end up within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lysosomes</TIMEX>.
        This obviously opens up many possibilities for interaction, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> therapy‚Äù
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        Type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Gaucher <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the most common type, seems a particularly suitable target for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme</ENAMEX> replacement therapy because of the lack of central nervous system involvement
        (visceral damage in Gaucher <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is reversible whereas the brain damage usually is not).
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, the underlying enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> had been identified, and methods had been
        developed to purify the enzyme from human placenta in a high state of purity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> groups
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> then attempted to treat the disease by infusing exogenous enzyme.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, the
        unaltered enzyme was infused directly into the venous circulation [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]; at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duarte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, it was entrapped in red cell membranes coated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in an
        effort to direct it to macrophages [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harrow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, the enzyme was delivered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entrapped</ENAMEX> in liposomes [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Although some mildly encouraging results were achieved, it was
        clear that none of these approaches was likely to be translated into a useful
        treatment.
        The needed conceptual breakthrough was provided by the identification of a mannose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> on macrophages and the suggestion that this might prove useful in replacement
        therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Gaucher disease</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. This led to the development of a modified enzyme,
        processed to expose mannose, and to its production on an industrial scale from placentas.
        After the gene encoding the enzyme was cloned [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], a recombinant product became
        available.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pivotal Study</ENAMEX>
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study of commercially produced mannose-enriched glucocerebrosidase was carried
        out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, presumably because of a limited supply of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Given this small cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, only a single dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> units/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) was
        administered. This dose was given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, while two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX>. This is manifestly an unusual dose schedule for a preparation
        with a circulating half-life of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 12</NUMEX> min that is being targeted to a relatively
        small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied did not live near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, and it
        is likely that the dose schedule that was chosen was based on convenience rather than on
        sound pharmacokinetic principles. Since it was unlikely that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> study would be
        launched if the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> failed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> wisely used a very generous dose of enzyme
        to maximize the probability that the trial would be successful. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intravenous</ENAMEX> administration
        of the enzyme produced objective clinical improvement (such as reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and spleen
        size and increased hemoglobin levels and platelet counts).
        The enzyme was promptly approved and marketed. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a single</TIMEX> dose had been tested,
        this was the dose that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> administered in clinical practice. But the
        preparation was extremely costly‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äîabout US$4.00</NUMEX> per unit. At the dose used in the pivotal
        trial, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70-kg</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> would receive enzyme costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$16,800</NUMEX> every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dosage Considerations</ENAMEX>
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visceral</ENAMEX> organ responses.
          But was the large dose given actually the dose required? There were no data, and many
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> were unwilling to give less than the dose that had been used in the pivotal
          trial. Moreover, since most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> took care of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> or at most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          the disease, they were not in a position to perform a dose-ranging study. And industry
          had no interest in supporting studies to show that a lower dose yielded equivalent
          results.
          But clinical trials carried out in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health‚Äìsponsored General</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Research Center</ENAMEX> quickly established that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> of the dose given at more
          frequent intervals was fully effective [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, a considerable body of data had
          accumulated, making it possible to perform meta-analyses of the relationship between the
          total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> dose, the interval at which the dose is administered, and the decrease in
          the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. The results were clear (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Even a dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 15</NUMEX>
          units/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kg</ENAMEX>/mo, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> of the dose given in the pivotal trial, resulted in an excellent
          clinical response. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were receiving a substantial overdose of an extremely
          costly preparation. The data indicate that when very large doses are administered, the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> time interval is adequate to give an optimal response, but when more modest
          doses are administered, more frequent infusions greatly improve the response [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
          Recent ‚Äúconsensus recommendations,‚Äù which were supported in part by the Genzyme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucocerebrosidase</ENAMEX> (imiglucerase,
          brand name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cerezyme</ENAMEX>), suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> be given an initial dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 to 60</NUMEX> units
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. But there is no high-quality evidence that such a costly treatment
          regimen provides results superior to those achieved with smaller doses. The only support
          for recommending this high dosage comes from uncontrolled studies showing that in some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> bone <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> may progress at low dosages. However, we know from our own
          published observations that skeletal progression and even fractures also occur in some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> receiving high-dose therapy [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Thus, I would caution against any
          recommendations to give high-dose therapy that have not been based on well-designed
          randomized, controlled trials. Having said this, I recognize that most, but not all, of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that were included in our meta-analyses were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, whereas the
          company-sponsored consensus recommendations refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. However, in the absence of
          any evidence-based rationale for administering large, costly doses of enzyme, I believe
          that the use of smaller, more frequent doses is the most prudent treatment approach.
          It is often assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe disease require larger doses of enzyme
          than those with mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, but a meta-analysis based on liver size or spleen size made
          it clear that this is not the case (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Large organs shrink more rapidly than
          smaller ones, and this is true regardless of the dose that is used [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeletal</ENAMEX> response.
          The response of enlarged viscera to enzyme infusion is much more rapid than the
          response of bones. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> early study, the large dose used in the pivotal trial was given
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to four years</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bone disease</ENAMEX>, and although the response was slow,
          gradual improvement occurred [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strangely</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that large doses were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">required‚Äî‚Äústrangely</ENAMEX>,‚Äù because they did not give smaller doses to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
          Subsequently, it was shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a quarter</NUMEX> of the dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 30</NUMEX> units/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kg</ENAMEX>/mo)
          produced an equivalent response [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Whom to Treat
        The severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Gaucher disease</ENAMEX> is very variable. We have estimated that some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients homozygous</ENAMEX> for the common 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.1226 C ‚Üí G</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N370S</NUMEX>) mutation never come to medical attention [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        Accordingly, many‚Äîpossibly most‚Äîpatients with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Gaucher disease</ENAMEX> require no treatment. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, the disease is rarely progressive [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,17</NUMEX>]. What you see is what you have, more or
        less. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bone fractures</ENAMEX>, of course, are not gradual events but sudden ones. But almost
        invariably they occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who already have very substantial, demonstrable bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, the situation is different, and progression is common. It is only
        with proper awareness of the natural history of the disease that one can make rational
        judgments regarding who needs treatment.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individualized Treatment</ENAMEX>
        Evaluating dose‚Äìresponse relationships in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Gaucher disease</ENAMEX> has been
        difficult for several reasons. The number of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> requiring therapy is relatively
        small, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genzyme Corporation</ENAMEX> has done little to encourage the performance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dose‚Äìresponse</ENAMEX> studies, making it difficult to enroll <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. But beyond that, the
        response of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to any dose is variable. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have suggested that this may be
        due to individual differences in dose requirements‚Äîthat some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are relatively
        resistant and require a large dose, while others do well on a small dose [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. This is an
        attractive concept, but is it correct? Another meta-analysis indicates that it is not.
        Rather, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who respond poorly to any dose and others who respond well to
        any dose [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Moreover, quadrupling the dose does not increase the rate of response
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does the Future Hold</ENAMEX>?
        The quality of life for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Gaucher disease</ENAMEX> has been greatly improved by the
        development of enzyme replacement therapy. Manufacturing and selling the enzyme has also
        been enormously profitable for industry. This profitability has served as a stimulus for
        the development of enzyme replacement treatments for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> less common and generally
        less responsive to treatment than Gaucher <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Given the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target population</ENAMEX>, these
        treatments are enormously costly on a per-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> basis. Treatments for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Fabry disease</ENAMEX> and
        Hurler-Scheie <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (also called mucopolysaccharidosis I) are already licensed, and
        others are on the way [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,21,22</NUMEX>]. This brings us face-to-face with a major ethical dilemma.
        We do not put a price on human life. Yet health-care resources are a zero-sum game. What is
        spent on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> disease cannot be spent on another. Is it better to treat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with
        Hurler-Scheie <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] or to provide good prenatal care to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who might not
        otherwise obtain it, or for that matter, to feed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> malnourished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>? These are
        difficult decisions that will be forced on us as enzyme replacement and other
        high-technology therapies come of age.
