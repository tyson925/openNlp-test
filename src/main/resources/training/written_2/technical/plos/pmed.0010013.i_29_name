        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lancet</ENAMEX>, chastised much of current surgical research and, in particular,
        questioned the usefulness of the case series as a predominant form of communication among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeons</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. He asked a poignant question: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">“Does</ENAMEX> surgical research have a future?” <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nearly</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade later</TIMEX>, it is important for surgeons and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeons</ENAMEX> alike to revisit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>'s
        challenge.
      
      
        Why <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Surgeons Favor Case Series</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trials (RCTs) have become the pillar of clinical research. Such
        trials attempt to obtain an unbiased randomization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with respect to known and
        unknown baseline conditions and to assess the effects of an intervention. However, only a
        minority of surgical studies involve a valid randomization scheme. The case series remains
        a favored method of clinical investigation in surgery.
        Case series are easy to perform, require less resources in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and funds,
        can be performed at a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, and, for many surgeons, represent a means to
        illustrate their surgical method and skills. In many instances, case series also serve as
        valuable intellectual background for future clinical or scientific work. For example,
        consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Burkitt</ENAMEX>'s report on jaw tumors in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Blalock</ENAMEX>'s
        initial efforts in cardiac surgery, or, more recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starzl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' observations,
        in a small collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> leukocyte chimerism, whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> acquire
        tolerance to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> cells. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' work led to powerful
        shifts in our understanding of the biology and treatment of disease [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3,4</NUMEX>]. All were case
        reports or case series—but under the current paradigm adopted by most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and
        evidence-based databases, they would not be valued [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,6,7</NUMEX>].
      
      
        Barriers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgical RCTs</ENAMEX>
        There are many reasons why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> in surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may be more difficult to perform
        than those in non-surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most important—though least understood—is
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of human disease in surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> makes them a more difficult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> to study. Surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are often heterogeneous in many more ways than
        non-surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. So it would be inherently easier, for example, to study a new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> for generally healthy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with essential hypertension than a surgical
        technique for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hepatic failure needing transplantation.
        In addition, while there may be value in studying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, there
        may be important differences in the skill levels of different surgeons, either between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX> or across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. For example, the skill levels of surgeons in trials of
        carotid endarterectomy may be greater than those across the surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as a whole.
        This makes the applicability of some surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> to the wider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> less certain than
        trials of medical therapies.
        So when it comes to surgical research, for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, it is
        easier to grapple with a difficult, but ultimately soluble, basic science question than to
        face the uncertainty of clinical research. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> understand these implicit issues
        and trim their sails accordingly.
      
      
        Improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rigor of Research</ENAMEX>
        Nonetheless, too much surgical work is conducted in the less rigorous format of the case
        series. What can and should be done to improve the rigor of surgical investigation? It
        would seem that improvements are required from within and beyond the surgical world.
        First, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horner</ENAMEX> observed, and several eminent surgeons have since agreed, reforms must
        begin within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> itself [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,5,6,7</NUMEX>]. Both during surgical training and in the early
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> development, surgeons must obtain a thorough grounding in the principles
        of basic research and proper clinical investigation.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, surgeons must establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and friendly relations with biostatisticians so
        that the latter may play a strong role in helping to develop adequately powered studies
        that can answer critical questions raised by new therapies and techniques. This is an
        especially acute need in an accelerating age of targeted therapies and disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomarkers</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, surgeons must re-engage in the clinical research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> and resume leadership
        roles in local and national clinical trials that involve surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, for example, an important step in this regard has been the establishment of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of Surgeons Oncology Group</ENAMEX>, which invites <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeons</ENAMEX> from all sectors,
        including private practice, to become active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in well-designed,
        multi-institutional trials [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Similar efforts are needed on a global level.
        Finally, similar to the pressures faced by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> elsewhere in academia,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon clinician-investigators</ENAMEX> must be nurtured, protected, and valued by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>. The financial health of academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> relies heavily
        on the generation of clinical revenue, which in many centers falls disproportionately on
        the shoulders of surgeons. New paradigms for revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> and funding of clinical
        research are needed.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funding for Surgical Research</ENAMEX>
        Beyond the walls of the academic medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, there also needs to be greater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of the value of scientifically sound surgical research and clinical
        investigation. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>), the major source of
        biomedical funding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, continues to convey a less welcoming attitude
        toward surgical research than toward other types of clinical or basic science[<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,9</NUMEX>].
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>, the principal instrument for performing peer review and making grant funding
        decisions is the study section, composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10–20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with expertise in a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>. There are few study sections devoted to surgically oriented clinical research and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> (from among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX>) in which surgeons make up even a
        reasonable minority of the committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. In comparison to those in other clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX>, surgical grant proposals are less likely to be funded, and awards, when
        funded, are smaller [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> need to recognize the importance of the surgical endeavor to modern
            medicine.
          
        
        Surgical research is also impeded by processes affecting other types of research as
        well. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 35 years of age</TIMEX> receiving a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first RO1</NUMEX> grant, the main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> mechanism for external funding, in any field, is below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>. The average age of initial
        funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44 years</TIMEX>, and shows a trend toward advancing age that
        has progressed significantly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two decades</TIMEX>. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> appears to reward
        experience and proven results very heavily, which may stifle innovation and likely serves
        as an innate barrier for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician-investigators</ENAMEX> contemplating research careers
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        To help correct for this worrisome trend, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">“K”</ENAMEX> award system—career
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> grants designed to help starting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> gain the experience needed to
        compete for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RO1</TIMEX> grants. However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 40%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> who receive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KO8</TIMEX> awards never
        apply for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RO1</TIMEX> funding [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], which suggests that the overall support—both explicit and
        implicit—for clinical research at the institutional and funding levels is inadequate.
        Finally, outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeons</ENAMEX> face similar, if not greater problems. This bodes
        poorly for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where the cost of evaluating new therapies and technologies may be an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unaffordable</ENAMEX> luxury. These challenges to the surgical research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> are therefore
        global issues and should merit the attention of surgeons, medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, and funding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        The Future
        What can be done? On the national and international level, funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> need to
        recognize the importance of the surgical endeavor to modern medicine. Recently, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> unveiled a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“roadmap”</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://nihroadmap.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov</ENAMEX>) designed to provide “new pathways
        to discovery.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">” Clear</ENAMEX>, careful, scientific surgical investigation must be part of this
        roadmap, although it is not specifically mentioned. Outreach efforts to include surgeons in
        a variety of study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> should be made to ensure that important insights into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathophysiology</ENAMEX> and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, with which surgeons are concerned on a daily
        basis, are not overlooked. Additional efforts are needed to improve funding for clinical
        research, both for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> at early stages of their careers and for multi-disciplinary
        clinical research and clinical trials. Locally, and individually, surgeons must join
        efforts to improve the clinical research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> by including training in clinical
        investigation at an early stage in medical school and during surgical residency training,
        fostering the careers of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon-investigators</ENAMEX> through committed, protected time,
        participating in local and national clinical research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and recognizing that
        development as a clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> takes time—many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in fact.
        These efforts may help ensure that surgical research is a vital part of the future of
        medicine and that it leads to the kind of high-quality work that shapes and remodels the
        face of medicine. To foster these efforts, surgeons must change and adapt to the currents
        of modern medical research. If this is successful, the case series will become the
        occasional rather than the common form of surgical communication. And surgeons, other
        clinicians, and, most importantly, basic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> will be better able to take advantage
        of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> of biomedical science opening before us.
        But the case series will always represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> important tool for early studies or
        uncommon conditions. It remains true that while the method one uses influences the answer
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> receives, it can be just as important to ask the right questions, which can be asked
        even in a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. And surely that is the place one must begin.
