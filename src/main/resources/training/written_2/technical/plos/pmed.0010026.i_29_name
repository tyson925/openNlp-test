        CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ cytolytic T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes (CTLs) are the primary effector cells of the
        adaptive immune system and have a major role in protecting us from a vast array of diseases
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTLs</ENAMEX> specifically recognize and lyse targets through the interaction of T
        cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (TCRs) on the surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> lymphocyte with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fragments (peptides)
        presented on the surface of target cells, in association with major histocompatibility
        complex (MHC) class I molecules. When a particular CTL interacts with a target <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, it
        rapidly divides to form a clonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of T cells with the identical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Townsend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> first elucidated the molecular basis of target cell recognition
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTLs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. They showed that antigens are processed inside the target cell into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX>-long peptides, which are then presented at the surface in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I molecules. This discovery suggested the possibility of using
        short synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> mimicking naturally processed antigens as immunotherapeutic drugs
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>. Short synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> are ideal for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> development because of the
        relatively low cost of production, easy storage, and high safety. However, not all peptides
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> alleles work well together to stimulate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTLs</ENAMEX>. So for clinical use, either patients
        would have to be selected for treatment based on their MHC I type or it would be necessary
        to make multiple peptides to cover the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I alleles in a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> cloned the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> recognized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumor-reactive CTLs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], it was not clear which antigens were recognized by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumor-reactive CTLs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>; so, it was not possible to rationally design cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>. Now, however, a long list of more or less tumor-specific antigens has been
        generated [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Most of the peptides identified so far are either normal self proteins
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aberrantly</ENAMEX> expressed in cancer but not in most other adult normal tissues or
        tissue-specific antigens also expressed in certain types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> show a
        spontaneous CD8
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ T</ENAMEX> cell response (occasionally at high levels) that is specific for
        several of these antigens. The development of such responses, however, requires a large
        tumor load, occurs late in the disease, and probably does not cause the efficient
        destruction of the tumor cells [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Thus, a central objective in cancer immunotherapy is to
        efficiently produce tumor-reactive CTLs at an earlier phase of the disease.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heteroclitic Tumor Antigen Peptides</ENAMEX>
        Unfortunately, some synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX>, including some corresponding to immunodominant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> (those which cause the biggest part of the immune response) from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor antigens</ENAMEX>,
        only seem to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I molecules with medium to low affinity and/or are recognized
        by specific T cells with relatively low avidity. These characteristics are the likely cause
        of the poor immune reaction generated by these peptides [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> strategy to improve the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> reaction is to make what are called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heteroclitic antigen variants</ENAMEX>. By improving
        either peptide binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>, recognition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX>, or both, these variants have increased
        peptide antigenicity and immunogenicity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solinger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> variants producing T cell
        responses that were stronger than those elicited by the parental sequences [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heteroclitic tumor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen peptides</ENAMEX> that showed highly improved antigenicity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunogenicity</ENAMEX> in preclinical studies, and which also cross-reacted well with CTLs
        generated against the parental sequence, were tested in clinical trials. The peptides
        selected for trials mostly contained substitutions of anchoring amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that were
        designed to increase peptide binding to the MHC molecule while minimally changing the shape
        of the epitope [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>].
        In a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], despite the careful study design, vaccination with
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX> resulted in the recruitment of T cells that bound antigens less efficiently
        and had lower tumor reactivity than those from the endogenous response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> propose that the cause for the decreased affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>-elicited CTLs could be
        the high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> density of these synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-presenting cells. An
        alternative explanation, however, is that the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptides</ENAMEX> used for vaccination
        simply fail to faithfully mimic the naturally processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigens</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The use of
        peptides that differ from those resulting from natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular</ENAMEX> processing has
        previously given rise to similar problems [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11</NUMEX>]. In any case, the enormous diversity in
        the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> repertoire provides a molecular explanation of the observed phenomenon.
        These results emphasize how difficult it is to translate findings, such as the spectacular
        results obtained by the vaccination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with heteroclitic peptides [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>],
        into an application for normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusion
        It is increasingly clear that even the smallest alteration in the structure of the MHC
        peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> can result in significant changes in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCRs</ENAMEX> are selected after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaccination</ENAMEX>. Thus, manipulating the immune T cell repertoire in vivo through the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heteroclitic tumor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen peptide variants</ENAMEX> could be harder than anticipated. As the field
        moves rapidly towards the use of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> adjuvants with high immunogenic potential
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], reassessment of the immunogenicity of natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> could be worthwhile in some
        cases. In addition, the careful analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific T cell clones, such as that
        reported here by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, will be crucial to ascertain the quality of the
        elicited immune response.
