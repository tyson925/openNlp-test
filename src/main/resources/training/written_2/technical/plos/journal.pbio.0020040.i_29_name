        half of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, everything looked simple and straightforward. It was the stuff you could
        explain to sincerely interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> who wanted to know what you were spending your
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on. There were oncogenes and there were tumour suppressor genes. Oncogenes were
        overactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that somehow caused <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> because they were overactive;
        therefore, they were dominant. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Tumour</ENAMEX> suppressor genes were genes that would normally
        prevent a tumour from happening and that needed to be inactivated for a tumour to start to
        form; both copies of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumour</ENAMEX> suppressor gene had to be inactivated, and the mutation was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recessive</ENAMEX>. If inactivation of these genes is a random process, it was understandable that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who inherit an inactivated copy of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumour</ENAMEX> suppressor gene had a higher risk of
        developing the associated form(s) of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> born with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> normal copies, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postulated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Knudson</ENAMEX>'s (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>) two-hit model. And, indeed, it was shown that in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumours</ENAMEX> in these predisposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the remaining wild-type copy of the tumour
        suppressor gene was lost, a process referred to as loss of heterozygosity.
        For me, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> things started to change. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venkatachalam et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) published a paper
        in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBO Journal</ENAMEX> describing a detailed study of tumours in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking one
        copy of the p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumour</ENAMEX> suppressor gene (
        Trp53 ). This gene is known to be the most mutated gene in human cancer
        and its function to be central to many processes that are involved in the cellular
        prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> lacking both copies of this gene are for the most part viable,
        but succumb to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (mainly thymic lymphomas) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to five months of age</TIMEX> (Donehower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 1992</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> born with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> copy of the 
        Trp53 gene start to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> at around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months</TIMEX>, and incidence
        increases with age.
        In their study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venkatachalam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> analysed an impressive group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX> 
        Trp53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/</ENAMEX>− <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of controlled genetic background and followed the fate of the 
        Trp53 wild-type allele in the tumours. According to the two-hit model, it
        was expected that in these tumours this copy would have been lost or inactivated. However,
        this turned out not to be the case. Half of the tumours from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> younger than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX>
        were found to have retained the wild-type copy of 
        Trp53 , a number that increased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX>. In
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tumours, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> sequenced the complete coding region of the remaining
        wild-type allele and showed it was structurally intact. To exclude the possibility of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulation</ENAMEX> or inactivation at the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression, they irradiated
        tumour-bearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> prior to sacrifice, a treatment known to increase p53 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels
        via posttranslational mechanisms. Their data showed the retained wild-type allele in these
        tumours was expressed normally and suggested it had a normal wild-type conformation.
        Next, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> did a rigorous test of different functions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX>. They
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> tested whether the tumours showed amplification of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mdm2</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, whose
        expression is regulated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, stimulates breakdown of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>, thereby forming a negative
        feedback mechanism that keeps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> levels low. Some tumours therefore amplify the 
        Mdm2 gene as a means of inactivating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>. However, this was not found in
        the tumours from the 
        Trp53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/</ENAMEX>− <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> tested to what extent the
        retained 
        Trp53 copy behaved normally. Irradiation of many tissues leads to
        p53-dependent apoptosis, and, indeed, in tumours that had retained the wild-type allele,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irradiation</ENAMEX> did lead to an increase in apoptosis, whereas in tumours that had lost the
        wild-type allele, it did not.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> is known to function as a transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> by either up- or
        down regulating target genes in response to different forms of cellular stress, including
        irradiation-induced DNA damage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> studied the expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> p53-upregulated
        genes (
        Cdkn1a , which encodes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p21</TIMEX>, and 
        Mdm2 ) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> downregulated gene (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pcna</ENAMEX> ) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-positive tumours after irradiation and showed responses
        indicative of normal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> function. Furthermore, it was shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53 protein</ENAMEX> from the
        tumours was able to bind to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-binding DNA sequence in an in vitro setting. Finally,
        since it is known that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> absence in tumours is correlated with chromosomal instability,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venkatachalam et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) used comparative genome hybridisation to compare this feature
        between p53-negative and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-positive tumours and found a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold greater stability in the
        latter.
        In short, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> clearly showed that, at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, in many 
        Trp53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/−</ENAMEX> tumours the wild-type allele of 
        Trp53 is not only retained, but also appears to function normally. This
        strongly suggested that a decrease of dosage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> is already sufficient for
        tumourigenesis, a phenomenon referred to as haploinsufficiency. Shortly before, the group
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moshe Oren</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb et al. 1997)</ENAMEX> had shown that a 
        Trp53
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+/−</ENAMEX> background leads to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50%</NUMEX> reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> activity
        using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p53</NUMEX>-responsive 
        lacZ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venkatachalam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        suggested the strong concentration dependence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> function could be explained by the
        fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p53</ENAMEX> functions as a tetramer. A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> decrease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> monomers can easily be
        imagined to result in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50%</NUMEX> decrease in functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tetramers</ENAMEX>, which in turn
        increases the chances of these cells becoming cancerous.
        This paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venkatachalam et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) made me realise how important it is to remain
        critical, even of long-established theories and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. Since then, haploinsufficient
        mechanisms have been described in more tumour suppressor genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (reviewed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fodde</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smits 2002).</ENAMEX> For instance, in a recent paper in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Trotman et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) used mouse models to describe how
        the dosage of the 
        Pten <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumour</ENAMEX> suppressor gene influences the occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>.
        Further genes have been described with other unexpected roles in the tumourigenic process.
        There is a long-standing debate in the literature about the number and role of mutations in
        a tumour, and without going into the details, it is clear that haploinsufficient mechanisms
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumour</ENAMEX> suppressor genes will greatly influence the statistics on which these
        discussions are based. At a time when microarray analysis has become a standard experiment
        and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of changes in tumour cells are analysed across the whole genome, it
        is important to keep in mind that the correct interpretation of this wealth of information
        might be more complicated than the widely accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> would have us believe.
