        human language must have been one of the strangest bans in the history of sciences. Yet it
        was highly effective. After the ban, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laymen</ENAMEX> had to wait for more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> to hold a textbook on language evolution in their hands. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language Evolution</ENAMEX>, a compilation of essays by a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        respected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, is amongst the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> books that try to tackle what is arguably one
        of the hardest scientific problems. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> set themselves the ambitious target of
        creating an up-to-date book about this emerging field, and they have to be congratulated
        for their efforts. Linguists, cognitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, behavioural ecologists, and theoretical
        biologists all offer their view on the origin of human language and, refreshingly, do not
        shy from pointing out the real or assumed weaknesses of the other approaches.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the main themes of the book is the evolutionary approach and the importance of
        biological structures and properties that were co-opted in the development of language
        (pre-adaptations). In one essay, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Studdert-Kenedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Goldstein</ENAMEX> propose that
        speech, as a motor function, draws on phylogenetically ancient mammalian oral capacities
        for sucking, licking, swallowing, and chewing. Thus, our hominid ancestors adopted an
        apparatus already divided neuroanatomically into discrete components. Complementing this
        evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Hauser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tecumseh Fitch</ENAMEX> compare human speech production and perception
        with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nonhuman species</ENAMEX>. They conclude that many traits that were formerly thought to
        have evolved specifically for speech (such as having a descended larynx or categorical
        perception) are also present in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        But perhaps the most interesting idea about pre-adaptation comes from the work of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neuroscientist Michael Arbib</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€˜mirrorâ€™ neurons</ENAMEX> in monkeys. These neurons are a subset of
        the grasp-related premotor neurons that discharge not only, as other premotor neurons do,
        when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> executes a certain class of actions, but also when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> observes more
        or less similarly meaningful hand movements made by the experimenter (or by another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">monkey</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> in which these grasp-related neurons are found is analogous with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broca</ENAMEX>'s area in human brains, which is involved in assessing the syntax of words. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observation</ENAMEX> serves as the basis for the mirror-system hypothesis, which postulates that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broca</ENAMEX>'s area in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> evolved from a basic mechanism not originally related to
        communication but rather from the mirror system for grasping in the common ancestor of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> and human. As a result, the mirror system provides a possible â€˜neural linkâ€™ in the
        evolution of human language.
        There is still much debate about the selection pressures that led to the evolution of
        language. Observing the overabundance of potential selective scenarios for why language
        evolved, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Bickerton</ENAMEX> voices his scepticism: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜The fact that these and
        similar explanations flourish side by side tells <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> immediately not enough constraints are
        being used to limit possible explanations.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€™ One</ENAMEX> frequent source of confusion, he notes, is
        equating language with speech by not distinguishing between modality, lexicon, and
        structure. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hauser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bickerton</ENAMEX>'s scepticism and urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to rely more
        on the traditional comparative approach, which was always the strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX>
        evolutionary theory.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primatologist Robin Dunbar</ENAMEX>, who originally proposed that grooming (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> bonding) could
        have provided the stimulus for language, dismisses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other possible scenariosâ€”hunting and
        tool-makingâ€”as potential ecological contexts for the evolution of human language. Gestural
        origins are also dismissed in his theory, because gestural languages do not seem to develop
        spontaneously and also require a line-of-sight contact making them useless at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
        Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Pinker</ENAMEX> rules out both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunbar</ENAMEX>'s theory of grooming and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX>'s theory of sexual selection, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bickerton</ENAMEX> rules out grooming, gossip, mating
        contract, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Machiavellian</ENAMEX> intelligence as likely contexts for the origin of human
        language.
        Also under fire in the book is the idea that the human brain is somehow equipped at
        birth with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜universal grammarâ€™</ENAMEX> out of which all human languages later develop. Several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> try to provide alternatives to innate predispositions, such as the importance of
        function to categorization (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Tomasello</ENAMEX>) and the importance of cultural transmission
        to the structure of language (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Kirby</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton Christiansen</ENAMEX>). Arbib explicitly
        questions the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chomskyan</ENAMEX> theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">innate linguistic predispositions</ENAMEX> and argues
        that what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> have and had in the past is â€˜language readinessâ€™ rather than a fixed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> grammar.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuroscientist Terrence Deacon</ENAMEX> also puts an alternative theory forward. According to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deacon</ENAMEX>, many of the language universals reflect semiotic constraints inherent in the
        requirements for producing symbolic reference rather than innate predispositions. Thus,
        neither evolved innate predispositions nor culturally evolved and transmitted regularities
        can be considered as the ultimate source of language universals. He draws a parallel with
        mathematical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> (addition, subtraction, etc.) and with prime numbers. Symbolic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX>, he argues, is constrained by the structure it refers to.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> claim, in the light of this diversity, that â€˜this book is intended to bring
        together, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, all the major perspectives on language <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">evolutionâ€™</ENAMEX>. We have
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> with this aim. First, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and scope have been
        published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past six years</TIMEX> based on the material from language evolution conferences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurford et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knight et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Although this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> might be just
        splitting hairs, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is more substantial: several crucial aspects of language
        evolution are not represented at all or are just touched superficially.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these missing themes is the selective advantage of early language. As discussed,
        many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> express their scepticism towards the selective scenarios found in
        the literatureâ€”and indeed towards such constructions in generalâ€”but there is no review and
        no balanced evaluation of these selective scenarios. Since one of the key questions of
        language evolution is the selective advantage of early language, the lack of such a review
        is a major weakness. A balanced account could have been presented even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and
        most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> are frustrated by the plethora of selective scenarios.
        Related to the possible selective advantage of language is the issue of genetic
        background. Although there is mention of the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FOX genesâ€”some mutations</ENAMEX> of which
        are associated with language disordersâ€”there is no detailed discussion of our current
        knowledge of genetics related to language.
        Another lightly treated theme is the neural basis of language and language evolution.
        Understandably it is one of the most difficult issues concerning human language, and no one
        expects the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> or any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> to come up with an answer to all the
        questions. What is missing again is a good survey outlining the problems and the current
        findings of the field.
        The weaknesses of the book come from its structure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>,
        instead of outlining a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> to contribute to that structure,
        appear to have let every contributor write freely about their current ideas and current
        research without regard to the bigger picture. This definitely shows the interests of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> and outlines the current state of the art; it leaves gaps, however, in the
        coverage of crucial topics related to the evolution of human language.
