        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, is at risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. In the tropical and subtropical regions of the world,
        malaria causes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 million</NUMEX> acute illnesses and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1 million</NUMEX> deaths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ninety</ENAMEX>
        percent of these deaths occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sahara</ENAMEX>, mostly among young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        To assess disease severity, peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood parasitemia</ENAMEX> is measured, but this is only a
        weak predictor of mortality in falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. In addition, a microscopist is only able
        to count the less pathogenic circulating stages of the parasite, whereas the more
        pathogenic parasitized erythrocytes, sequestered in the capillaries and containing mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX>, are not seen and therefore not counted. However, sequestered 
        Plasmodium falciparum parasites secrete Histidine-rich protein <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PfHRP2</NUMEX>), which is liberated into the plasma at schizont rupture.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arjen Dondorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> suggest that the plasma
        concentration of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> might provide a better estimate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s total
        parasite biomass and therefore be a more accurate prognostic indicator than circulating
        parasite load. There is evidence to support this hypothesis. A recent study by the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PfHRP2</NUMEX> in 
        P. falciparum cultures, and showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 89%</NUMEX> of
        PfHRP2 is liberated at schizont rupture and that the variation in the amount released is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>.
        In the current study the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> measured plasma PfHRP2 concentrations in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">337</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with varying severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">falciparum malaria</ENAMEX> and, using a simple mathematical
        model, estimated the total body parasite biomass. This value was compared with measures of
        disease severity and outcome. The developmental stage distribution of circulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX>, which also provides information on the sequestered parasites, was also evaluated
        in relation to plasma <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfHRP2</TIMEX> levels in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found that the estimated geometric mean parasite burden was more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized without
        signs of severe disease, and was highest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who died. Statistical analysis
        revealed that the estimated total parasite biomass was clearly associated with disease
        severity and outcome. By contrast, peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood parasitemia</ENAMEX> and the number of
        circulating parasites were not associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> outcome, nor with other measures of
        severity such as admission plasma lactate concentrations.
        The finding that sequestered parasite biomass is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> severity fits
        with current thinking that sequestration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">erythrocytes</ENAMEX> containing the mature forms of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasite</ENAMEX> is the central pathological process in falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>.
        However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> noted there were several factors that might contribute to inaccuracies
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. For example, the amount of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PfHRP2</TIMEX> secreted per parasite varies between
        different parasite strains. Also, in high transmission areas, where partial immunity
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> develops, clearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PfHRP2</ENAMEX> might be increased in the presence of
        antibodies against the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>; in these areasâ€”such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in sub-Saharan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africaâ</ENAMEX>€”the
        model would thus underestimate the parasite burden and might need to be adapted further for
        use.
        Despite these issues, estimates of plasma PfHRP2 concentrations may be useful as a
        research tool to stratify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' parasite loads, say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. They conclude that
        quantitative measurements of plasma PfHRP2 in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">falciparum malaria</ENAMEX> could be
        used to estimate the total parasite biomass, a parameter pivotal in the pathophysiology of
        the disease, and that this total parasite biomass is associated with clinical measures of
        the severity of the disease.
