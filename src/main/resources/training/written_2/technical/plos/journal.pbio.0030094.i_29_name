        proper number of chromosomes. The dividing cell closely monitors that chromosomes are
        copied exactly once and then distributed correctly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> cells. After replication,
        the chromosomes (now comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chromatids) align at the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, and are
        attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> known as the spindle apparatus. A key point of attachment is the
        centromere, a characteristic constriction carried by each chromosome. The spindle, which is
        composed of microtubules, pulls the chromatids apart so that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> complete sets of
        chromosomes are gathered together at each pole of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, which can then divide. Cohesion
        between chromosome copies, which keeps the chromatids together until just the right time,
        therefore plays a critical part in this process.
        Chromosome cohesion is established during S phase (when the chromosomes are replicated)
        and is then dissolved completely in metaphase to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids to come apart. The
        dissolution of cohesion is highly regulated; human cell lines that have defects in the
        regulation of cohesion show the hallmarks of cancer cells [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Furthermore, it has been
        suggested that the abnormal karyotypes that result in diseases such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Down syndrome</ENAMEX> are
        the result of the improper dissolution of chromosome cohesion [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Finally, mutation of a
        factor required to load cohesinâ€”the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> complex responsible for chromosome
        cohesionâ€”onto chromosomes appears to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornelia de Lange</ENAMEX> syndrome, a clinically
        heterogeneous developmental disorder that may include facial dysmorphia, upper-extremity
        malformations, hirsutism, cardiac defects, growth and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cognitive retardation</ENAMEX>, and
        gastrointestinal disorders [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4,5</NUMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohesion</ENAMEX> serves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> roles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> with respect to accurate genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX>. First, cohesion close to the centromere facilitates bi-orientation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosomes</ENAMEX>, such that each chromosome becomes attached to the two poles of the spindle
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it prevents the splitting of chromosomes until all bipolar attachments are
        made [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The function of cohesion at the centromere is presumably to oppose the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of
        microtubules, which pull the chromosomes to opposite spindle poles; this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is not
        exerted along the chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, which means that cohesion at centromeres and along arms
        is functionally distinct. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, cohesion along chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> may be essential for proper
        chromosome condensation [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>], although the function of cohesion at chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> is
        something of a mystery.
      
      
        Differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arms</ENAMEX> and Centromeres
        Cohesion in eukaryotic cells is mediated by a multi-subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohesin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohesin</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smc1, Smc3, Scc1/Mcd1</ENAMEX> (also known as kleisin),
        and Scc3 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SA2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smc</ENAMEX> (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins form
        intramolecular coiled coils that have been observed in the electron microscope to form a V
        shape with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> that are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 nm</NUMEX> long [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The cohesin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has been proposed to form a
        ring structure that encircles sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chromatids</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Alternately, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rings may snap
        sisters together via interactions between the coiled coils of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. All
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the cohesin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are essential in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae , since mutation results in the
        precocious dissociation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids. Functional orthologs of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> exist
        in all eukaryotes.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> types of cohesin sites: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) cohesin associated with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centromere</ENAMEX> and the nearby pericentric domain, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) cohesin associated with chromosome
        arms [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,13,14,15</NUMEX>]. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , cohesin at centromeric and pericentric domains
        is spread over a broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to 50 kb</NUMEX>), large quantities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are
        bound, and binding is not affected by the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcriptional</ENAMEX> and coding status of the
        regions that are occupied. By contrast, binding sites in arms tend to be much smaller
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 1 kb)â</NUMEX>€”at least in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , where they have been most extensively
        characterizedâ€”and of lower intensity, and are spaced at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately every 11 kb</TIMEX> (see
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohesin</ENAMEX> in arms localizes to regions lacking transcription in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,16,17</NUMEX>].
        This reinforces the view that there may be functional differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and pericentric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cohesion</ENAMEX> and perhaps different mechanisms to load cohesin, as has been proposed for cohesin
        on meiotic chromosomes for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. A unifying feature of all cohesin-binding sites
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> is high AT (adenine and thymine) content
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,15</NUMEX>].
        Another important difference between cohesin binding along <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and at centromeres is
        that the arm sites do not appear to be dependent on a DNA consensus sequence, whereas
        binding to pericentric regions requires specific centromere sequence [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,14</NUMEX>]. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae centromere sequence is composed of three DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEII</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEIII</ENAMEX>). Studies of cohesion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">centromere</ENAMEX> reveal that as
        little as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 bp</TIMEX> (a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEII</ENAMEX> and the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDEIII</ENAMEX>) are required to direct cohesion
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,14,19</NUMEX>]. Mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Ndc10</ENAMEX> have also been shown to affect cohesin
        deposition at centromeres. Ndc10 forms part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> known as the kinetochore, which
        forms around the centromere and is responsible for the attachment to the spindle;
        establishment and maintenance of cohesion at pericentric regions may therefore rely on both
        the centromere sequence and kinetochore function [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,20</NUMEX>]. Presumably both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and
        pericentric cohesion are important for chromosome dynamics, but the functional differences
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are not well understood.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohesionâ€”It</ENAMEX>'s Just a Phase
        Cohesion can be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phases that occur during the cell cycle (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>):
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) deposition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX> (the gap in the cell cycle before S phase), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> in S
        phase, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) maintenance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G2</TIMEX> (the gap between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and mitosis), and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) dissolution in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Scc2 and Scc4</TIMEX> are responsible for loading cohesin onto unreplicated
        double-stranded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Then, during S phase, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in
        establishment of cohesion between replicated chromatids. Eco1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chl1</ENAMEX> are required for
        establishing cohesion but not for maintenance [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,23,24</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between cohesion
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA replication</ENAMEX> have led to a model whereby cohesion is established coincident with the
        passage of the replication fork [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. This requires an alternative replication factor C
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RF-C</ENAMEX>) complex [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,27,28</NUMEX>] and may require the origin recognition complex (ORC) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohesion</ENAMEX> is maintained during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G2</TIMEX> by the cohesin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, and is eventually dissolved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids to separate.
        The dissolution of cohesion is regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> mechanisms. First, subunits of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may be phosphorylated, which facilitates their removal. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, phosphorylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scc1/Mcd1</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX> kinase makes it a better substrate for proteolysis [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,31,32</NUMEX>]. In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> , one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related papers exploring the regulation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohesin</ENAMEX> in vertebrates shows that phosphorylation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Scc3</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SA2</NUMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinase is
        apparently sufficient to allow dissociation from chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, which occurs during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prophase</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]. In 
        Xenopus extracts, phosphorylation of cohesin also depends on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polo</ENAMEX>-like kinase, and this phosphorylation reduces the ability of cohesin to bind to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mechanism that can facilitate the dissolution of cohesin is proteolysis; this
        may be particularly important at centromeres. The <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scc1/Mcd1</ENAMEX> component of the cohesin
        complex is cleaved by a separase (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Esp1</NUMEX>) whose activity is held in check by a securin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Pds1</NUMEX>)
        until separation at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33,34</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Separase</ENAMEX> is a cysteine
        protease that cleaves <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scc1/Mcd1</ENAMEX>, presumably resulting in the cohesin complex falling apart
        and being unable to hold sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chromatids</ENAMEX> together.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scc1/Mcd1</ENAMEX> at pericentric regions is protected from phosphorylation during prophaseâ€”and
        therefore dissociation from chromosomes is preventedâ€”by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> known as shugoshins
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,36,37</NUMEX>]. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on cohesin in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , McGuinness et al.</ENAMEX> show that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shugoshin</ENAMEX> specifically
        protects Scc3 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SA2</NUMEX>) at the centromere, so that centromeric cohesion is preserved until the
        chromosomes are ready to separate [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. Vertebrate shugoshin has been shown to have a
        strong microtubule-binding domain [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>] and is found at the kinetochore [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>]. Recent
        evidence suggests that shugoshin in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae may sense tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> chromatids,
        acting as part of a spindle checkpoint that monitors whether chromosomes are properly
        aligned on the mitotic spindle [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>]. It is currently unclear why the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        mechanisms to dissociate cohesin from chromosomes, although it is interesting to speculate
        that this could be related to different functions of cohesin at chromosome arms versus
        pericentric domains. For instance, cohesin in chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> may help to organize or
        condense chromosomes, whereas cohesin at centromeres may be more directly involved in
        chromosome bi-orientation at the spindle and segregation. These functions may be important
        during different phases of the cell cycle.
      
      
        A Link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromatin</ENAMEX> and Cohesin
        Several results suggest that transcription and cohesin binding are incompatible. In 
        Drosophila , one of the components that loads cohesin (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nipped</ENAMEX>-B
        or Scc2) has also been shown to be required for long-range <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">promoterâ</ENAMEX>€“enhancer interactions
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,40</NUMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> model proposed to explain this result is that cohesin can prevent long-range
        promoterâ€“enhancer interactions and that removal of cohesin can restore these interactions
        and allow transcription to occur [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nipped-B</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scc2</ENAMEX> can act as both a
        loading factor and an unloading factor for cohesin. This model further speculates that
        rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornelia de Lange</ENAMEX> syndrome stemming from a cohesin loading defect, the failure
        to unload cohesin from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> that need to be transcribed leads to transcriptional defects
        that cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>. In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae it has been shown that driving transcription
        through a centromere via an inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> prevents cohesin from associating and
        results in chromosome missegregation and cell death [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohesin</ENAMEX> is found at the
        boundaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMR</ENAMEX> locus, the right telomere of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chromosome III</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the RDN1</TIMEX> array, all
        regions of silent chromatin [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Cohesin localizes to intergenic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> is converging [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,17</NUMEX>].
        Since transcription and chromatin configuration are intimately related, it is possible
        that chromatin may play an important role in the localization of cohesin. Indeed, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> remodeling complex RSC (remodels the structure of chromatin) has been shown to be
        important for establishment of cohesin binding [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>], and another study suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX> is
        particularly important for cohesin association with chromosome arms [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. The chromatin
        remodeling complex ISWI (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SNF2h</NUMEX>) has been shown to be essential for cohesin to localize to
        Alu repeats (certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>) in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>]. The possibility also exists that
        cohesin itself may influence transcriptional status and act as a transcriptional boundary
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,40,45</NUMEX>]. The preferential location of cohesin in heterochromatin in pericentric regions
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> also supports the idea that chromatin
        modification/structure is a key determinant of cohesin localization [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,47</NUMEX>]. It is
        interesting to speculate that chromatin differences and transcriptional differences between
        chromosome arms and centric regions will turn out to be related to different mechanisms for
        loading and removal of cohesin from these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>.
        While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the primary roles for chromosome cohesion in bi-orientation and mitotic
        chromosome segregation is well-established, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of the regulation of cohesion
        are still being discovered. Cohesin may be involved in multiple ways in chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>. Future studies focusing on the differences between cohesion at chromosome arms
        versus pericentric domains and the link between cohesion and transcription will likely
        yield very interesting insights into the function of the cohesin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in the maintenance
        of genome integrity.
