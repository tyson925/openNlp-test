        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> studying the behaviour of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. This is because human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> can give
        a verbal account of their experience. For example, they can report: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lights of
        different colour look equally brightâ€™ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜This object looks further away than that oneâ€™.
        Such direct reports facilitate studying how information from the sensory periphery, that
        is, the sense organs that actually interface with the environment, is processed in the
        brain.
        The perceptual world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> is often very different from that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have sensory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> lack; for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> can see
        ultraviolet and polarised light. But how they actually perceive the world, based on
        information from their sensory periphery, is often beyond our grasp. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> cannot
        describe their sensations, our access to them is often based on indirect psychophysical
        tests, where animal performance depends fundamentally on motivation and training method
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> do in fact describe the world around them, but
        not necessarily in ways that we might intuitively understand. Perhaps the best example of
        this are the honeybees (genus 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apis</ENAMEX> ), which have a symbolic â€˜languageâ€™ that nestmates use to
        communicate with each other about profitable food <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. By eavesdropping on this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have recently obtained a unique perspective into the perceptual
        world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>.
        How does the dance language work? A triumphant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout bee</ENAMEX> returns from the field, and
        advertises the location of a newly discovered food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to nestmates. To do this, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forager</ENAMEX> performs a repetitive sequence of movements, the so-called waggle dance, which is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most intriguing examples of complex animal behaviour. The successful forager
        wiggles her abdomen provocatively from side to side, moving forward in a straight line.
        Then she runs in a half circle to the left, back to her starting point, performs another
        straight wiggle run along the path of her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and then circles to the right (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        This pattern is repeated multiple times, and is eagerly attended by unemployed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hive</ENAMEX>. Shortly after such dances commence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of newly recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">foragers</ENAMEX> arrive at the
        food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> being advertised.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl von Frisch</ENAMEX> deciphered the code hidden in this
        seemingly senseless choreography performed on vertical honeycombs in the darkness of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hive</ENAMEX> (reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Frisch 1967).</ENAMEX> He found that the angle of the waggle run from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vertical</ENAMEX> is equal to the angle between the sun's azimuth and the indicated food source
        outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hive</ENAMEX>. For example, if a food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is found in the direction of the sun, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> will waggle â€˜straight upâ€™ the vertical comb. If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45Â°</NUMEX> to the right of
        the sun's direction, the waggle run will be oriented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45Â°</NUMEX> to the right of vertical on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comb</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The distance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, a flower patch with abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nectar</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX>,
        is encoded in the duration of the waggle run: the longer the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bee waggles</ENAMEX>, the larger the
        distance of the food from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hive</ENAMEX>. No other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>) uses a similarly
        symbolic representation to communicate information from the real world.
        But how do <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> measure the flight distance that they communicate so precisely? It was
        previously thought they do this by measuring the energy used as they fly (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heran 1956).</ENAMEX>
        However, doubts emerged when it was found that distance estimation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> could be
        manipulated by altering the number of landmarks between the hive and a food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">suggesting bees</ENAMEX> were counting landmarks encountered en route (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geiger 1995).</ENAMEX> In
        an elegant experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>) tapped into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees'</ENAMEX> dance language to access
        their subjective assessment of flight distance. They let <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees forage</ENAMEX> from a food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> 70
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> from the hive and recorded the dance distance code of the returning foragers.
        Subsequently, the feeder was attached to a weather <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX>, and slowly lifted to an
        altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90 mâ</NUMEX>€”so that the distance between the hive and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> now increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> m
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m. Correspondingly</ENAMEX>, foragers should have indicated a longer distance, by stretching
        their waggle run duration. But, in fact, the perceived distance (as indicated in the dance)
        
        decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX>! This clearly shows that bee perception of
        distance cannot solely be based on energy expenditure, since a longer flight that cost more
        energy was danced as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shorter â€˜distanceâ€™</ENAMEX> in the waggle run.
        So what actually drives the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bee odometer</ENAMEX>? Because the landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> pass in flight
        moves more slowly when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees fly</ENAMEX> at higher altitudes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>) conjectured that
        foragers process the speed with which visual contours move across the eye (optic flow), and
        integrate this with travel time. To confirm this hypothesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srinivasan et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>)
        further exaggerated the experienced image flow, by training <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> to fly through narrow
        chequered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> grossly overestimated actual travel distance, bragging to
        their nestmates that they had flown <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX> m when in fact they had flown <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">m. Attendees</ENAMEX> of
        these dances promptly believed the high-class swindle, and searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> at remote
        locations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> had never even visited (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esch et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
        The quality of information available about the velocity of the passing landscape will
        depend, of course, on the sensitivity of the eyes. The eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of
        colour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, with maximum sensitivity in the ultraviolet, blue, and green domains of
        the spectrum (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autrum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Zwehl 1964).</ENAMEX> Their excellent colour vision is optimal for
        flower identification (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chittka 1996</ENAMEX>), but do they also use it to measure the image velocity
        of the passing landscape? Surprisingly, the answer is noâ€”bee odometry is in fact totally
        colour blind. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tautz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> use exclusively the signal from
        their green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for measuring image velocity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), confirming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> reports
        that motion vision in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> is mediated only by this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> type (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Giurfa and Lehrer 2001</ENAMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Spaethe et al. 2001</ENAMEX>). Thus, the level of intensity contrast present in the scene strongly
        influences the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>' subjective experience of flight distance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tautz</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2003</ENAMEX>).
        With so many external variables influencing distance estimation, it seems unlikely that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honeybee odometer</ENAMEX> would be very robust in natural conditions. Now, as reported in this
        issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Tautz et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) have quantified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>' subjective
        experience of distance travelled when they fly over natural terrain with varying levels of
        contrast. Specifically, they compared the dances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> flying over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (scenery with
        low visual contrast) with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> flying over land (scenery with relatively high
        contrast). They trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> to forage at a feeder on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, which was paddled increasing
        distances from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hive</ENAMEX>, until it reached an island. All the while, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> at the hive
        deciphered the dances of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> returning from the feeder. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> flying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> hardly appeared to register an increase in travel distance, whereas the same
        increase in distance flown over land resulted in a substantial increase in perceived flight
        distance. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>' odometer is largely based
        on visual, external cues and demonstrates that this system is sensitive to visual
        contrast.
        But there must be something else beside visual cues. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, in the near
        absence of visible ground features, is extremely difficult without a reliable internal
        instrument measuring travel speed. This is the case even for us <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with sophisticated
        measuring devices: malfunctioning air speed indicators have been responsible for several
        airplane crashes into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, for example Birgenair Flight 301 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AeroPeru</ENAMEX> Flight 603 in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindauer</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>) likewise observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">honeybees</ENAMEX> flying over lakes
        sometimes lost altitude and plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. However, the new study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tautz et</ENAMEX> al.
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) also shows that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> will reliably fly over prolonged stretches of water
        without accident. Furthermore, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> experience only a small increase in
        subjective travel distance when flying over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, it is not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. This indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>
        do perhaps resort to an internal measure of flight distance when other cues fail. For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bumblebees</ENAMEX> walking to a food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> in absolute darkness, that is, in the complete
        absence of visual cues, are able to correctly gauge travel distance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittka et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>),
        indicating that an internal odometer, possibly based on energy consumption, also exists. It
        appears that animal navigation, just like aviation, relies on multiple backup systems that
        support each other and can compensate if one system fails in a certain context.
        Spying on honeybee dances can not only tell us about the cues they use for navigation,
        but also allows insights into the cognitive architecture that governs other aspects of bee
        behaviour, such as the assessment of flower quality. We've learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> prefer high
        over low nectar concentrations because this is reflected in their dances. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> find
        better nectar, they dance more enthusiastically, that is, the number of dance circuits per
        minute increases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seeley et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waddington 2001).</ENAMEX> However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waddington</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) found
        that the relationship between actual and perceived nectar quality is nonlinear. In fact, it
        is a positive but decelerating relationship, so that an increase in sucrose concentration
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10% to 20%</NUMEX> results in twice the difference in dance rate that an increase from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> does. Interestingly, the perceived change in quality is stronger when there is a 
        decrease than when there is an 
        increase in nectar quality of the same magnitude. Such asymmetric
        perception of gains and losses is well known in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, where it has been linked to
        risk-aversive behaviour (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tversky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahnemann 1981).</ENAMEX> Unfortunately, animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> often
        do not yield this type of information very readily. Only in their own language do they
        reveal many of their perceptual peculiarities. Using the bee language as a window into
        insect visual perception has been a wonderful tool and is a promising <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> for further
        research into the question of how miniature brains encode the world around them.
