        evolutionary novelty and ecological diversity. Microbial symbionts in particular have been
        major evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalysts</ENAMEX> throughout the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of life on earth and have
        largely shaped the evolution of complex organisms. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endosymbiosis</ENAMEX> is a specific type of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbiosis</ENAMEX> in which oneâ€”typically microbialâ€”partner lives within its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and represents the
        most intimate contact between interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitochondria</ENAMEX> and chloroplasts, for
        example, result from endosymbiotic events of lasting significance that extended the range
        of acceptable habitats for life. The wide distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular bacteria</ENAMEX> across
        diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and marine and terrestrial habitats testifies to the continued importance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endosymbiosis</ENAMEX> in evolution.
        Among multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> as a group form exceptionally diverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that live exclusively within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells and undergo maternal transmission to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> have piqued the
        interest of evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> because they represent a wide spectrum of evolutionary
        strategies, ranging from obligate mutualism to reproductive parasitism (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchner</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ishikawa 2003</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> , the publication of the full genome sequence of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproductive</ENAMEX> parasite 
        Wolbachia allows the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> genomic comparisons across this range
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lifestyle Extremes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Insect</ENAMEX> Endosymbionts
        At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of the spectrum, beneficial endosymbionts provide essential nutrients to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10%â€“15%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> and provide models for highly specialized, long-term mutualistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜primaryâ€™ endosymbionts</ENAMEX> are required for the survival and
        reproduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, most of which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> on unbalanced diets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant sap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>,
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>, and occur within specialized host cells called bacteriocytes (or mycetocytes)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baumann et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baumann 2000).</ENAMEX> Molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrate
        stability of these obligate mutualists over long evolutionary periods, ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. By allowing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> to exploit otherwise inadequate food
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and habitats, the acquisition of these mutualists can be viewed as a key innovation
        in the evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Telang 1998).</ENAMEX> Owing to their long-term, stable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> (vertical transmission), these cytoplasmic
        genomes have been viewed as analogs to organelles.
        By contrast, reproductive parasites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolbachia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Neill et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) and the more recently discovered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endosymbiont</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacteroidetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CFB</ENAMEX> or CLO) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunter et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propagate</ENAMEX> in insect lineages by manipulating host reproduction. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maternally</ENAMEX> inherited
        bacteria inflict an impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> of reproductive alterations to increase the
        frequency of infected female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>, often at the expense of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>. Such
        mechanisms include cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, and male killing or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feminization</ENAMEX>. As parasites, these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> rely on occasional horizontal transmission to
        infect new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noda et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) and, by directly altering reproductive patterns,
        may be a causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> speciation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bordenstein et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
        Comparative molecular analysis of insect endosymbionts over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> has provided
        new insights into their distribution across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, their varying degrees of stability
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> lineages (ranging from cospeciation to frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-switching), and their
        impressive genetic diversity that spans several major bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. More recently,
        studies in genomics of obligate mutualistsâ€”and now 
        Wolbachia â€”illuminate mechanisms of hostâ€“symbiont integration
        and the distinct consequences of this integration in various symbiotic systems. In
        addition, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and symbionts often have different evolutionary interests, the
        diverse features of insectâ€“bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> can be understood as different outcomes
        in the negotiation of genetic conflicts. Some recent highlights and tantalizing research
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> are described below.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Endosymbiont Genomes: Spanning the Gamut from Static to Plastic</ENAMEX>
        The distinct lifestyle of endosymbionts has clear effects on rates and patterns of
        molecular evolution. Compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, endosymbionts are thought to have
        reduced effective population sizes due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> bottlenecks upon transmission to host
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">offspring</ENAMEX> and, in the case of obligate mutualists that coevolve with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>, limited
        opportunities for gene exchange. The nearly neutral theory of evolution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ohta 1973</ENAMEX>)
        predicts accelerated fixation of deleterious mutations through random genetic drift in
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, a phenomenon that has been observed in endosymbionts (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran 1998).</ENAMEX> Over time, this lifestyle-associated accumulation of deleterious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> may negatively affect the fitness of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and symbiont.
        It is increasingly clear the distinct lifestyle of endosymbionts also shapes the
        architecture and content of their genomes, which include the smallest, most AT-rich
        bacterial genomes yet characterized (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurland</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran 2002).</ENAMEX> A common
        theme is substantial gene loss, or genome streamlining, which is thought to reflect an
        underlying deletion bias in bacterial genomes combined with reduced strength or efficacy of
        selection to maintain genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cellular environment. As a result of gene loss,
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> completely rely on the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> for survival. Because they cannot be easily
        cultured apart outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> for traditional genetic or physiological techniques,
        analysis of genome sequence offers a valuable tool to infer metabolic functions that
        endosymbionts have retained and lost and to elucidate the steps in the evolutionary
        processes of genome reduction.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, full genome sequences have been published for 
        Buchnera of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> aphid host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, 
        Wigglesworthia of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tsetse flies</ENAMEX>, and 
        Blochmannia of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shigenobu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akman et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamas et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gil et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Ham et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> Parallels among these mutualist
        genomes include their small size (each smaller than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">810 kb</NUMEX>), yet retention of specific
        biosynthetic pathways for nutrients required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> (for example, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitamins</ENAMEX>). However, genomes also show signs of deleterious deletions. Early gene loss in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Buchnera</ENAMEX> involved a few deletions of large contiguous regions of
        the ancestral genome and often included genes of unrelated functions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mira 2001).</ENAMEX>
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜large stepsâ</ENAMEX>€™ imply that genome reduction involved some random chance (due to the
        location of genes in the ancestral chromosome) and selection acting on the combined fitness
        of large sets of genes, rather than the fitness of individual loci. Such deletions are
        apparently irreversible in obligate mutualists, which lack recombination functions and
        genetic elements, such as prophages, transposons, and repetitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that typically mediate
        gene acquisition. The scarcity of these functions, combined with limited opportunities to
        recombine with genetically distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, may explain the unprecedented genome
        stability found in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchnera</ENAMEX> compared to all other fully sequenced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (Tamas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2002</ENAMEX>) and a lack of evidence for gene transfer in other mutualist genomes. Stability
        also extends to the level of gene expression, as obligate mutualists have lost most
        regulatory functions and have reduced abilities to respond to environmental stimuli (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcox</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2003</ENAMEX>).
        The 
        Wolbachia genome presented in this issue allows the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> genome
        comparisons among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that have adopted divergent evolutionary strategies in their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Like other parasites, but unlike long-term
        mutualists, 
        Wolbachia may experience strong selection for phenotypic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, for example, to counter improved host defenses, to compete with distinct 
        Wolbachia strains that coinfect the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>, or to increase
        its transmission to new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> backgrounds. High levels of recombination in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolbachia</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiggins et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) may allow rapid
        genetic changes in this parasite and may be catalyzed by the exceptionally high levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repetitive DNA</ENAMEX> and mobile elements in its genome (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wu et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that
        colonize specialized niches for long periods and lack co-colonizing strains also possess
        high levels of repetitive chromosomal sequences. For example, among ulcer-causing 
        Helicobacter pylori in primate guts, repetitive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> mediates
        intragenomic recombination and may provide an important source of genetic variation for
        adaptation to dynamic environmental stresses (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aras et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). The potential
        contributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repetitive DNA</ENAMEX> and phage to intragenomic and intergenomic recombination in
        
        Wolbachia are exciting areas of research (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masui et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
        The 
        Wolbachia genome also provides a valuable tool for future
        research to test whether plasticity extends to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content variation among 
        Wolbachia <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> and labile gene expression patterns.
        Between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extremes of obligate mutualism and reproductive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parasitism</ENAMEX> lies a
        spectrum of secondary symbionts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, most of which have not yet been studied in
        detail. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€˜guestâ€™ microbes</ENAMEX> transfer among diverse host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SandstrÃ¶m et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>),
        may provide more subtle or occasional benefits (for example, relating to host defense
        against parasitoids [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oliver et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>]), and could represent an intermediate stage
        between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living lifestyle and obligate endosymbiosis. Genome-level data from these
        secondary symbionts promise to shed light on the range of lifestyles between obligate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutualism</ENAMEX> and reproductive parasitism and on the early stages in the transition to each.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Microarray</ENAMEX>-based comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> content among 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> , a facultative mutualist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tsetse flies</ENAMEX> (
        Sodalis glossinidius ), and a relatively young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutualist</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weevils</ENAMEX> (
        Sitophilus oryzae primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">endosymbiont</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOPE</ENAMEX>]) show that genome
        streamlining in the endosymbionts may preclude extracellular existence, and highlight
        modifications in metabolic pathways to complement specific host physiology and ecology (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2003</ENAMEX>). In addition, these endosymbionts may employ similar mechanisms as
        intracellular parasites in overcoming the shared challenges of entering host cells,
        avoiding or counteracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> defense mechanisms, and multiplying within a host cellular
        environment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hentschel et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). The rapidly growing molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX> for secondary
        (or young primary) insect endosymbionts have identified pathways that are considered to be
        required for pathogenicity, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Type III</ENAMEX> secretion (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dale et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001, 2002</TIMEX>). Such
        pathways may therefore have general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells and may
        have evolved in the context of beneficial interactions.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic Conflicts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hostâ€“Symbiont Dynamics</ENAMEX>
        Given their diverse evolutionary strategies, insect endosymbionts also provide a rich
        playing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> to explore genetic conflicts (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank 1996a</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996b</TIMEX>), which might involve the
        mode of symbiont transmission, the number of symbionts transmitted, and the sex of host
        offspring. Genetic conflicts described between organelle and nuclear genomes of the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurst 1995)</ENAMEX> can provide a context to understand the evolutionary dynamics of
        insectâ€“bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> and the diverse outcomes of these relationships. For example,
        the uniparental (maternal) mode of inheritance of both mitochondria and insect
        endosymbionts may reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> defense against invasion by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> with strong
        deleterious effects, which spread more easily under biparental inheritance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX> and Hutson
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>).
        Hostâ€“symbiont conflicts over offspring sex ratio are quite apparent in reproductive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parasites</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vala et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). While the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> favor more female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> and employ a
        variety of mechanisms to achieve this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> typically favors a more balanced sex ratio.
        This conflict may lead to changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> that counter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">symbiont</ENAMEX>'s effect on sex
        ratio. For example, the spread of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolbachia</ENAMEX> in a spider mite population caused selection on host
        nuclear genes that decrease the symbiont-induced sex ratio bias (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noda et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
        Obligate mutualists also experience genetic conflicts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> regarding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transmission</ENAMEX> mode and number. In general, symbionts generally favor dispersal out of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> to avoid competition with their close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> are expected to restrict
        symbiont migration and thus reduce the virulent tendencies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank 1996b</ENAMEX>). In obligate
        mutualisms, there may be little room for negotiation. For example, the highly conserved,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-controlled determination of aphid bacteriocytes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braendle et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) and the
        phylogenetic congruence observed in numerous studies suggest that aphids have won this
        conflict over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">symbiont</TIMEX> transfer. However, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> transmitted may be more
        flexible and is known to vary among aphid taxa (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran 2002).</ENAMEX> Models indicate that
        the fixation rate for symbiont-beneficial (selfish) mutations increase with the number of
        symbionts transmitted, reflecting greater efficacy of selection among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> within a
        given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rispe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran 2000).</ENAMEX>
      
      
        Prospects
        In sum, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> have witnessed a surge of new empirical and theoretical
        approaches to understand the dynamics of bacterialâ€“insect relationships. These tools have
        shed light on the roles of recombination, selection, and mutation on endosymbiont genome
        evolution and have highlighted parameters that shape the outcome of genetic conflicts
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> and symbionts. These data provide a foundation for studying the evolution of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mutualism</ENAMEX> and parasitism and modes of transitions between them. In the near future, we can
        look forward to full genome sequences that span a broader ecological and phylogenetic
        diversity of endosymbionts and provide a richer comparative framework to test existing
        models and develop new ones.
        Developments in endosymbiosis are important not only to questions in basic research, but
        may have important practical applications. Blood-feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tsetse</ENAMEX> flies are vectors for parasites that cause significant global infectious diseases
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dengue</ENAMEX> virus, and trypanosomiasis, many of which have frustrated attempts
        at vaccine development. The same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> that transmit these devastating human parasites
        often possess a diversity of mutualistic and parasitic bacterial endosymbionts. A very
        promising and urgent area of endosymbiont research is the manipulation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> vector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in the field. Current studies already provide evidence that
        endosymbiont manipulation is a promising strategy to reduce the lifespan of the insect
