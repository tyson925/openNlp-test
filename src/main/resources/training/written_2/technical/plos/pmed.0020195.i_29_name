        the incidence of multiple births‚Äîprimarily of nonidentical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, but also of identical
        ones‚Äîhas dramatically increased. Multiple pregnancies are high-risk pregnancies, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preterm</ENAMEX> delivery and monochorionicity (shared placenta) the major problems. Consequently,
        efforts are underway to optimize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of these pregnancies.
        While identical (monozygotic) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> are much less common than dizygotic ones,
        monozygotic twinning events are increased after induced ovulation and in vitro
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX>. Monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> can be diamniotic dichorionic (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amniotic sacs, two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placentas</ENAMEX>), monoamniotic monochorionic (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> amniotic sac, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> placenta), or diamniotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monochorionic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amniotic sacs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> placenta). The last type accounts for approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of all monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>.
        Monochorionic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> are at higher risk because they share a common placenta; they are
        primarily at risk from circulation abnormalities like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">twin‚Äìtwin transfusion syndrome</ENAMEX> (the
        smaller twin [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>] does not get enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> while the larger twin [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX>] becomes
        volume overloaded) and intrauterine growth restriction. However, the majority of diamniotic
        monochorionic twin pregnancies do not develop such complications.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Fisk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have studied records of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> seemingly uncomplicated
        diamniotic monochorionic pregnancies and found a surprisingly high rate of fetal death: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unexpected</ENAMEX> intrauterine deaths occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> pregnancies with no prior signs
        of complications. All deaths occurred within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of a normal scan, at a median
        gestational <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 34 weeks</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> conclude that ‚Äúdespite intensive fetal surveillance, structurally normal
        monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies without twin‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Äìtwin transfusion syndrome</ENAMEX> and
        intrauterine growth restriction are complicated by a high rate of intrauterine death.‚Äù As
        the deaths occurred predominantly after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest that the
        prospective risk for fetal death in these pregnancies might be eliminated by elective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preterm</ENAMEX> delivery after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX>.
        In an accompanying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perspective</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">DOI: 10.1371/journal</TIMEX>.<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pmed.0020180</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Cleary</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary D'Alton</ENAMEX> agree that, despite the limitations of the study (its retrospective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, small numbers, and lack of dichorionic controls), it highlights a critical question
        for obstetricians, namely, ‚Äúwhen is the ideal gestational age to deliver apparently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uncomplicated monochorionic twins?‚</ENAMEX>Äù As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleary-Goldman</ENAMEX> and D'Alton discuss, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX> of
        gestation many of the risks associated with prematurity have abated, but the remaining ones
        are not negligible. Until larger prospective observational studies have been conducted,
        balancing these risks remains challenging.
