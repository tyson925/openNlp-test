        journals reflected the needs of a closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, its place in the
        world, and the dissemination of information have changed utterly. So in starting afresh,
        what should a new medical journal retain, and what should it ditch?
        Most obviously, we should throw out the old way of disseminating information. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
        electronic age, it is no more difficult, and it is only minimally more costly, to provide
        access to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> than it is to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. So the revolutionary idea of anyone
        being able to read any article is possible. This idea—open access—which completely
        challenges <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old</TIMEX> subscription-based publishing model, is the driving force behind the
        launch of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> . You can download and distribute articles without
        restrictions (feel free to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> copies, translate articles into other languages,
        put articles into books—just give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> proper credit).
        We have also changed the way we involve the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>. Our large
        global editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> reflects the diversity of medicine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and is intimately involved
        in what we do. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> are a crucial part of our peer
        review process. As academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> they, along with a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, take
        research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> through the peer review process in a way that we believe provides the most
        constructive and fair review. We are delighted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of our editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> have
        also shown their support for our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> by submitting papers to us, even before we
        launched.
        What will we publish? The research article on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> in this issue reflects our
        priority of publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that take the greatest toll on health globally.
        But we will also publish papers reporting a substantial advance in any specialty, whether
        that advance is in public health, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on the global burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>; drug
        effects, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> on lipids; or the molecular
        understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, such as the paper dissecting out the immune responses in lung
        disease caused by smoking.
        A good general medical journal should also be a place where the global medical community
        can discuss together what matters to them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> section of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> will be devoted to comment, lively debate, and diverse
        opinions, in particular giving neglected voices and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> a place in the limelight. In
        this issue's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> section you will see articles from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> continents that cover a huge
        range of topics, from basic sciences (such as the pathology of emphysema) to global public
        health (such as palliative care in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>). You will find diverse
        opinions—for example, on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is helping or hindering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>'s progress
        towards tackling <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, and on whether health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> should routinely screen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for
        domestic violence (tell us what you think by taking our poll at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plosmedicine</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>). And
        you'll find case-based learning materials on meningitis linked to an online video and an
        online quiz.
        
          
            The revolutionary idea of anyone being able to read any article is possible.
          
        
        Interpretation of results is an essential part of a medical journal's job. Although we
        expect that many of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, we hope <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will range from patients
        wanting to learn about the latest research on their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> wanting to use an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>, to policymakers. Hence, we have several levels of comment on
        original research. Perspectives, written by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>, are aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who are already
        familiar with the topic. Synopses, written by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> 's professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX>, should provide any health
        professional with a quick introduction to an article. Patient summaries provide a starting
        point for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to assess the relevance to them of a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
        We have decided not to be part of the cycle of dependency that has formed between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> and the pharmaceutical industry, an industry that focuses overwhelmingly on the
        most profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, thus sidelining many of the world's health problems. Medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> have allowed their interests to become aligned with those of the pharmaceutical
        industry by printing advertisements for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, publishing trials designed by drug
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, and making profits on reprints used as marketing tools. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> will not accept advertisements for pharmaceutical products
        or medical devices. Our open-access license allows free distribution of articles, so PLoS
        cannot benefit from exclusive reprint sales. And we consider as the lowest priority for
        publication papers that are simply aimed at increasing a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>'s market share without
        obvious benefit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        We will aim to have the highest levels of transparency in our published papers. We
        require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> to tell us of any possible competing interests; we in turn will tell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> about them.
        But, information flow should not be just one-way. Our editorial doors (or at least our
        E-mail boxes) are always open. We want your feedback on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>: send us an E-mail or
        submit an eLetter about any article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, take part in our polls, contribute
        ideas for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> section and submit original research. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> for the global medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>; we invite
        you to join in.
