        Embryonic stem (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>) cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> mass of the
        blastocyst that can be maintained in culture for an extended period of time without losing
        differentiation potential. The successful isolation of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ES cells</ENAMEX> (hESCs) has raised
        the hope that these cells may provide a universal tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to treat many human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. However, directed differentiation of hESCs into specific tissue types poses a
        formidable challenge. Protocols are currently available for only a few cell types, mostly
        of neural identity [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1–3</NUMEX>], and differentiation into many of the cell types derived from the
        paraxial mesoderm has not been reported, with the exception of a recent study indicating
        osteoblastic differentiation [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from the
        adult bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], adipose tissue [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], and dermis and other connective tissues [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvesting MSCs</ENAMEX> from any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> requires invasive procedures and the availability
        of a suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> that can be obtained from a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>, and the capacity of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> for long-term proliferation is rather poor. In
        contrast, hESCs could provide an unlimited number of specialized cells. In this study, we
        present techniques for the generation and purification of mesenchymal precursors from hESCs
        and their directed differentiation in vitro into various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesenchymal</ENAMEX> derivatives, including
        skeletal myoblasts. Our isolation method for mesenchymal precursors is the first example,
        to our knowledge, of efficiently deriving structures of the paraxial mesoderm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>
        cells, and further highlights the potential of hESCs for basic biology and regenerative
        medicine.

          Myogenic Differentiation
          Confluent hESMPCs were maintained for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2–3</NUMEX> wk in alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          heat-inactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>. More rapid induction was observed in the presence of medium
          conditioned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h by differentiated C2C12 cells. Coculture of hESMPCs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C2C12</NUMEX> cells
          was carried out in alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> horse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">serum</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were confirmed in

        Results
        Mesenchymal differentiation of hESCs (lines H1 [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">WA-01</ENAMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H9</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">WA-09</ENAMEX>]) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] was induced
        by plating undifferentiated hESCs on a monolayer of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OP9</ENAMEX> stromal cells [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>], in the
        presence of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> heat-inactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> in alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX> medium. OP9 cells have been previously
        shown to induce blood cell differentiation from mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ES cells</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> d of
        coculture, cells were harvested and sorted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD73</TIMEX>, a surface marker expressed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adult MSCs</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). An average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> CD73+ cells was obtained from the mixed
        culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">OP9</ENAMEX> and differentiated hESC progeny. CD73+ cells were replated in the absence of
        stromal feeders on tissue culture plates and expanded in alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX> for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7–14</NUMEX> d. We next established the membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> profile of the resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        flat spindle-like cells. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H1</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">H9</NUMEX>-derived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD73</NUMEX>+ cells expressed a comprehensive set
        of markers that are considered to define adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>, including CD105(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SH2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STRO-1</ENAMEX>, VCAM
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD106</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD29</TIMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">integrin β1</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD44</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICAM -1</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD54</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALCAM</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD166</NUMEX>), vimentin, and alpha smooth
        muscle actin (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B and 1C</TIMEX>). The cells were negative for hematopoietic markers such as
        CD34, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD45</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD14</TIMEX>. They were also negative for neuroectodermal, epithelial, and muscle
        cell markers including nestin, pancytokeratin, and desmin (data not shown). The human
        identity of these presumed mesenchymal cells (termed hESMPC<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-H1.1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-H1.2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-H1.3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-H1.4</ENAMEX>, and
        -H9<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>) was confirmed for all experiments by immunocytochemistry for human nuclear antigen
        to rule out the possibility of contamination with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">OP9</NUMEX> cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S1</NUMEX>).
        To further characterize hESMPCs, we performed genome-wide expression analysis using
        oligonucleotide arrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">U133A</ENAMEX>). The expression profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hESMPC-H1.2</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hESMPC-H9.1</ENAMEX> were compared with that of human primary adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Housekeeping genes</ENAMEX> for
        each of the mesenchymal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were eliminated by subtracting those transcripts
        also expressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent samples of undifferentiated hESCs.
        Based on this analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,280</NUMEX> transcripts were selectively expressed in hESMPC<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-H1.2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">932</NUMEX>
        transcripts in hESMPC<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-H9.1</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,218</NUMEX> transcripts in primary adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>. A remarkable
        overlap of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">579</NUMEX> transcripts shared among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mesenchymal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> was observed
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1D</NUMEX>). Using the genes that were selected in the initial filter, we performed a
        statistical analysis on the expression levels to determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were expressed
        significantly differently in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> types. We used a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> extension to the
        standard 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] to assess this difference. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">579</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">412</NUMEX> of them
        were significantly different, at a false discovery rate cutoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>. The relative fold
        changes were also extremely large in many of the cases. We also looked at the variance of
        the expression levels within the cell types. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX> had a coefficient of
        variation <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20%</NUMEX> for the expression (log transformed); for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>-derived cells, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values from the test, the mean and standard deviation of the
        expression levels, and the relative fold change of all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">412</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> between the two types.
        Known markers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>, such as mesenchymal stem cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein DSC54</ENAMEX>, were all included
        within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">579</NUMEX> shared transcripts. These findings support the immunocytochemical data and
        suggest that hESMPCs and primary MSCs are highly related.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> are characterized functionally by their ability to differentiate into mesenchymal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, such as fat, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. Therefore, we tested whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hESMPCs</ENAMEX> have the
        same potential (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Adipocytic differentiation of hESMPCs was induced under conditions described previously
        for primary adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells harboring fat granules</ENAMEX> was observed after
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10–14</NUMEX> d in culture. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> wk of induction, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 70%</NUMEX> of the cells displayed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oil Red</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>+ fat <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">granules</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARγ</ENAMEX>, a marker of adipocytic differentiation, was detected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>.
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>).
        Chondrocytic differentiation was achieved using the pellet culture system [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
        d in culture, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50%</NUMEX> of all cells exhibited robust staining for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcian Blue</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix proteoglycans</ENAMEX>. Chondrocytic differentiation was
        confirmed by the gene expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and 
        aggrecan , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components of extracellular matrix selectively expressed
        by chondrocytes, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>).
        Osteogenic differentiation was induced in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">β-glycerolphosphate</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
        Osteogenesis was demonstrated by specific staining for calcium deposition in the matrix
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Kossa</ENAMEX>, Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>; or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Alizarin Red</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S2A</NUMEX>) and increased expression of 
        bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and 
        bone sialoprotein at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day 28</TIMEX> of treatment (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C and S2B</TIMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 28</TIMEX>,
        Alizarin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red staining</ENAMEX> was detected in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70%</NUMEX> of all cells. Throughout these
        studies, human adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> and foreskin fibroblasts were used as positive and negative
        controls, respectively.
        In addition to adipocytic, chondrocytic, and osteogenic differentiation, reports
        suggested that adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> can form skeletal muscle [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Although generation of skeletal
        muscle cells from adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX> remains controversial, we tested whether hESMPCs exhibit this
        potential. Under the conditions previously described [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hESMPC-H1.1 and -H9.1</ENAMEX> did not
        yield significant numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MyoD</ENAMEX>+ cells after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15–20</NUMEX> d in culture. However, when confluent
        cells were maintained in culture in the presence or absence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AzaC</ENAMEX> without passage for
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 21</NUMEX> d, expression of specific skeletal muscle markers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MyoD</ENAMEX> and fast-switch
        myosin was observed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). More rapid myogenic differentiation was obtained in the
        presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h-conditioned medium from the murine myoblastic cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C2C12</NUMEX> previously
        induced to form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myotubes</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Direct coculture of hESMPCs with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C2C12</NUMEX> cells led to the
        formation of hESMPC-derived myotubes, as visualized by expression of human nuclear antigen
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>), similar to those formed by host <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C2C12</NUMEX> cells. After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> wk of coculture, myotubes
        composed of human nuclei accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10%</NUMEX> of the total number of human cells
        present, and each human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myotube</ENAMEX> was composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to ten</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nuclei</ENAMEX>. Human cell
        contribution to myotubes in coculture was confirmed by expression of human muscle-specific
        transcripts such as 
        MyoD, myosin heavy chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myogenin</ENAMEX> (data not shown). These data demonstrate that hESMPCs can give
        rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesenchymal</ENAMEX> derivatives typically obtained from primary adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSCs</ENAMEX>, as well as to
        cells expressing markers of skeletal muscle.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for the clinical application of hESC-derived progeny in regenerative
        medicine is the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teratoma</ENAMEX> formation due to the presence of residual undifferentiated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells among the differentiated progeny. We did not detect markers of undifferentiated
        hESCs, such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanog</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oct-4</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], in any of the hESMPCs by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocytochemistry</ENAMEX> (data not shown), suggesting the lack of any undifferentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cells
        in hESMPC cultures. However, future in vivo studies are required to rule out the potential
        of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">teratoma</ENAMEX> formation.
      
      
        Discussion
        Previous studies have demonstrated the derivation of neural cells [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1–3</NUMEX>], hematopoietic
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and endothelial lineages [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and cardiomyocytes [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] from hESCs. This study presents
        the induction of paraxial mesoderm with the generation of multipotent mesenchymal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX>. We calculate that under these conditions a single undifferentiated hESC yields
        an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one CD73</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day 40</TIMEX> of differentiation, suggesting a balance between
        cell proliferation and cell selection. There were no obvious differences in marker and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profile or in differentiation behavior among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hESMPC lines
        generated. However, some of the lines (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hESMPC9.1</ENAMEX>) exhibited a tendency of spontaneous
        osteogenic differentiation after long-term propagation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directed</ENAMEX> differentiation of hESCs
        into somatic stem-cell-like precursors represents a substantial advancement in harnessing
        the developmental potential of hESCs. The high purity, unlimited availability, and
        multipotentiality of hESMPCs will provide the basis for future therapeutic efforts using
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in preclinical animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Such in vivo studies will also be
        required to properly assess the safety profile of these cells. Furthermore, our system also
        offers a novel platform to study basic mechanisms of mesodermal induction and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> during early human development.
