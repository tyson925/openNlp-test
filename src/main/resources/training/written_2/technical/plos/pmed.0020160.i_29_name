        In addition to the role of smoking in cancer initiation and promotion, cigarette smoking
        accelerates atherogenic cardiovascular disease in both a dose- and a duration-dependent
        manner through several concurrent pathways. Smoking incites an immunologic response to
        vascular injury, described as oxidative stress leading to lipid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peroxidation</ENAMEX>, endothelial
        cell dysfunction, and foam cell proliferation in the tunica media [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>]. Smoking also
        enhances platelet aggregation, impairs lipoprotein metabolism, depresses high-density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (HDL) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, and reduces distensibility of vessel walls [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>].
        Cigarette smoking is associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers. During
        the acute phase of inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, there are quantifiable increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>reactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, white blood cell count, and fibrinogen, and decreases in serum albumin [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5‚Äì8</NUMEX>].
        Acute inflammatory markers have been shown to be both prognostic and predictive of future
        cardiovascular events in several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> has been
        discussed extensively as a marker of cardiovascular disease risk [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9‚Äì16</NUMEX>].
        C-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in particular is also increasingly being implicated in the
        pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17‚Äì19</NUMEX>]. C-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is a pentaxin, highly conserved
        across species [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,20,21</NUMEX>] and stimulated synergistically by both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IL-6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IL-1Œ≤</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22‚Äì25</NUMEX>].
        Previously believed to be synthesized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, recent evidence suggests that
        C-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is also produced at the site of atherosclerosis by smooth muscle cells
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> wall, it induces expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX> molecules on endothelial cells
        and increases monocyte chemotactic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">protein-1</TIMEX>, which attracts monocytes and T cells into the
        vessel wall [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26‚Äì28</NUMEX>]. Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> reduces endothelial nitric oxide
        synthase, upregulates the proatherosclerotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NF-Œ∫B pathway</ENAMEX>, enhances low-density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lipoprotein</ENAMEX> (LDL) uptake by macrophages, which become foam cells, and facilitates T-cell-
        and complement-mediated destruction and apoptosis of the endothelium [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,26,29‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äì31</ENAMEX>]. Thus,
        C-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is increasingly described not only as a marker of the inflammatory
        response, but also as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
        disease [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,27</NUMEX>]. Other inflammatory markers may also have causal properties, but are not as
        well understood. The inflammatory response therefore not only indicates atherosclerotic
        potential, but may accelerate atherosclerosis.
        Several studies have described a prevalent inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. Despite the
        known impact of smoking on cardiovascular disease progression, few studies have examined
        the impact of smoking cessation on levels of inflammatory markers or on cardiovascular risk
        reduction [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,32</NUMEX>]. The level to which the inflammatory response subsides following smoking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cessation</ENAMEX> and the rate at which the inflammatory response subsides are uncertain.
        Furthermore, it remains unclear whether traditional risk factors can adequately explain the
        decline in cardiovascular risk following smoking cessation.
        Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHANES III</ENAMEX>), a
        population-based representative sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, we investigated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between smoking and smoking cessation and levels of inflammatory markers and
        traditional cardiovascular risk factors. We examined the association between changes in the
        inflammatory markers‚ÄîC-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, white blood cell count, albumin, and
        fibrinogen‚Äîand the traditional risk factors‚Äîtotal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>,
        triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">diabetes‚Äîwith</ENAMEX> decreased smoking intensity and
        increased time since smoking cessation. Our primary objective was to investigate changes in
        C-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in an effort to characterize the excess cardiovascular risk associated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX> and any associated decline in risk with smoking cessation. We also aimed to
        characterize whether the inflammatory markers or traditional risk factors explained
        observed cardiac risk reduction following smoking cessation.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHANES III</ENAMEX> survey and data collection procedures have been described in detail
          elsewhere [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33,34</NUMEX>]. Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NHANES III</ENAMEX> was a national probability survey conducted
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1988 and 1994</TIMEX>. This survey used a complex, multi-stage, stratified cluster
          sampling design to obtain a representative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Participation included a home examination and a visit to a
          mobile examination <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> locations. For those unable to travel to a mobile
          examination <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a special home visit was arranged.
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,618</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> and over included in the NHANES III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, we
          excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,021</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> for whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> levels were missing, given that this
          was our primary marker of interest. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> were excluded because they were
          pregnant, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">816</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were excluded because they reported cigar, pipe, snuff, or
          chewing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,489</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> were analyzed.
        
        
          Measures
          Self-reported race/ethnicity was categorized as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX> white, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Hispanic</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, or other. The self-reported poverty to income ratio, a marker of
          socioeconomic status used in multiple prior studies [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,36</NUMEX>], was classified as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1.5</NUMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5‚</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì3</TIMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>3</ENAMEX>.
          Self-reported clinical factors were dichotomized for analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> reported
          on use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, estrogen replacement therapy, and
          vitamin supplements. Use of any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 24</TIMEX> h was measured by dietary recall
          questionnaire. Prior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>-diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>, myocardial infarction, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> was
          defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> (ASCVD). Prevalent
          inflammatory disease was defined as the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX>,
          emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. Presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute illness</ENAMEX> was indicated by a positive
          answer to the question: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</TIMEX> have you had a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX>, cold, or other acute
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">illness?‚Äù</ENAMEX>
          Additional clinical factors were measured by a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> self-report
          and clinical exam and were also dichotomized for analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypertension</ENAMEX> was indicated by
          use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anti-hypertensive medication</ENAMEX>, an average systolic blood pressure over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>,
          or an average diastolic blood pressure over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> readings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diabetes</ENAMEX>
          mellitus was considered present if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> diagnosis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX> (excluding diagnosis during pregnancy), was taking diabetes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medications</ENAMEX>, had fasting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma glucose</ENAMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">126 mg/dl</ENAMEX>), or had non-fasting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> levels over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 mg/dl</ENAMEX>). Finally, serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and triglyceride
          levels were measured enzymatically (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">704</NUMEX> analyzer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boehringer Mannheim</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mannheim</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> was calculated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friedewald</ENAMEX> equation and measured fasting
          triglycerides, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> and triglycerides
          were included as continuous variables and were logarithmically transformed to approximate
          the normal curve.
          Smoking history was categorized based on both self-report and serum cotinine levels.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> who gave a history of current smoking and/or had serum cotinine levels greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) were considered current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. Current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were
          categorized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> roughly equal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, based on number of cigarettes per day: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1‚Äì9,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10‚Äì19</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20‚Äì29</NUMEX>, and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> cigarettes per day. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were defined by self-report
          as having smoked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> cigarettes in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> and as having quit smoking. Former
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were categorized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> since smoking cessation. Since the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> year since
          cessation point is subject to misclassification bias, the following levels were used in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">analyses: <1, 1‚Äì3, 3‚Äì5, 5‚Äì7, 7‚Äì9</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>9</NUMEX> ysince cessation. Never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were
          defined by self-report and as having serum cotinine levels under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> (<<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> with cotinine levels over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nmol</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) were categorized
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> at the lowest dose-intensity level.
          Our main outcome variable, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>, was measured using a latex-enhanced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dade Behring</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deerfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>).
          Because the presence or absence, rather than the absolute level, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>reactive protein
          appears to be associated with cardiovascular risk, we compared undetectable versus
          detectable levels of this marker. This is consistent with previous research, given the
          nonlinearity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> interpretation [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37,38</NUMEX>]. Since the limit of detection
          for the latex-enhanced nephelometry assay was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/l, we defined undetectable as less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/l. Other outcome variables were treated continuously. White blood cell count
          was determined using a fully automated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulter S-PLUS JR</ENAMEX> hematology analyzer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman</ENAMEX>
          Coulter, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fullerton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). Albumin was measured using the
          bromocresol purple method. Fibrinogen was measured using a quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> of clotting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> compared to a known standard.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Methods</ENAMEX>
          The distributions of traditional risk factors, inflammatory markers, and clinical and
          sociodemographic factors were examined by smoking status. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> and analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> tests, as appropriate, were performed to test for statistically significant
          differences. Variables identified as potential confounders by these bivariate analyses
          were included in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multivariate</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, as were the cofactors believed to be clinically
          relevant.
          For multivariate analyses, our primary independent variables were smoking intensity
          and time since smoking cessation. Our primary dependent variables were the inflammatory
          markers‚ÄîC-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, and serum albumin‚Äîand the
          traditional risk factors‚Äîsystolic blood pressure, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sets of multivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were developed. The first
          set of analyses (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">minimally</TIMEX> adjusted) were adjusted for age, sex, and race, given
          previously reported differences in the distribution of inflammatory markers in those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of analyses (fully adjusted) were adjusted for all covariates and
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confounders</ENAMEX>: age, sex, race, poverty to income ratio, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index,
          prevalent cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, prevalent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, prevalent chronic inflammatory
          condition, current acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, and estrogen replacement.
          For inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors that were measured continuously,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> regressions were used to model the relationship to smoking intensity and time
          since smoking cessation. Least square means were calculated. C-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (a
          dichotomous variable) was modeled with logistic regression, using never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> as the
          reference category. Odds ratios, however, do not approximate risk ratios, given that the
          prevalence of elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 10%</NUMEX>.
          The dose‚Äìresponse relationship between both smoking intensity and time since smoking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cessation</ENAMEX> and each of the outcomes was assessed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mantel</ENAMEX> tests for trend. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> sets
          of tests were performed, evaluating the trends: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) among current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> by cigarettes
          per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) among former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> by time since cessation; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, former
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, and non-smokers, despite the potential nonlinearity between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. To further
          explain the relationship between smoking exposure and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>, to increase the
          power to detect a trend, and to reduce residual confounding, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> was
          categorized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> levels: under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX> (undetectable), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.1‚Äì9.9 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/l</ENAMEX> (mildly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevated</ENAMEX>), and ‚â<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">•10.0 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/l</ENAMEX> (clinically significant).
          Lastly, blocked group comparisons were done using adjusted <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> tests.
          Inflammatory and traditional risk factors were compared across current, former, and never
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> to validate findings from previous studies.
          All analyses were weighted to represent the total civilian, non-institutionalized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>; they are, therefore, population prevalence estimates. Analyses
          were conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.02</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>)
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUDAAN</ENAMEX> (version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.0</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Triangle Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Triangle Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), incorporating sampling weights to account for nonresponse and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversampling</ENAMEX>. All analyses were conducted using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided tests with alpha set to
          0.05.
        
      
      
        Results
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,489</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in our sample, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,665</NUMEX> were classified as never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,459</NUMEX> were
        classified as former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,365</NUMEX> were classified as current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. The average

        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        Bivariate analyses of smoking status showed that among the inflammatory risk factors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unadjusted C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>, white blood cell count, and fibrinogen were all
        significantly and positively associated with smoking status (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albumin</ENAMEX> levels were similar across smoking categories.
        Among traditional risk factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> had higher total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and triglycerides, but
        were otherwise younger, had lower body mass index, and had lower blood pressure, and a
        smaller proportion were diabetic. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> were most likely to have prevalent
        atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
        Bivariate analyses of the inflammatory markers showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> was
        significantly associated with older <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>- trend < <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.01 by 10-y</NUMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>), female sex (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>), and black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>). Serum albumin and serum fibrinogen showed similarly
        significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. White <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count was associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX> (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>), but not with age or sex. Among traditional risk factors,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> showed that total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>,
        and systolic blood pressure were each associated with age, sex, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX> (all 
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diabetes</ENAMEX> was associated with age and race only (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> use was associated with age and sex only (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.01</NUMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, therefore, were adjusted for age, race, and
        sex.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> displays abatement of the inflammatory response with (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) reduced intensity of
        smoking and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) increased time since smoking cessation, adjusted for age, sex, and race.
        C-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, white blood cell count, and fibrinogen were all positively associated
        with increased smoking intensity (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p ‚</ENAMEX>â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.01</NUMEX>) and were all significantly negatively associated with time
        since smoking cessation (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>). Similarly, albumin showed a negative association with
        intensity of smoking (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p ‚</ENAMEX>â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.01</NUMEX>), but no relationship after cessation. All acute phase reactant
        inflammatory markers had significant trends overall, from current to former to never
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smokers</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p ‚</ENAMEX>â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.01</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Differences in the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>,
        adjusted for age, sex, and race. Total and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> usage,
        and systolic blood pressure all showed a dose-dependent association with smoking intensity
        (
        p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triglycerides</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use showed time-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> with smoking cessation (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p ‚</ENAMEX>â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.01</NUMEX>). Overall trends (from current to former to never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>) were
        present for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use, triglycerides, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDL cholesterol</ENAMEX>, as shown in
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. In models fully adjusted for all covariates (not shown), dose-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> persisted for HDL <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and triglycerides (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p ‚</ENAMEX>â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.01</NUMEX>). Both total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and triglycerides showed an association
        with time since smoking cessation (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> for both) and an overall trend from current to never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> in
        fully adjusted models.
        Lastly, the inflammatory markers were examined in fully adjusted models. C-reactive
        protein continued to show abatement of the acute phase response with reduced smoking
        intensity and increased time since cessation despite adjustment for covariates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
        White blood cell count and albumin were associated with smoking intensity but not with time
        since cessation. All positive acute phase reactants showed an associated decline from
        current to former to never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> in fully adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p ‚</ENAMEX>â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.01</NUMEX>); albumin, likewise showed a significant increase (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -trend ‚â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 0.01</NUMEX>).
        Analyses using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack-years</ENAMEX> were also done (not shown); the results were unchanged using
        this measure. Additionally, data were reanalyzed excluding those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with prevalent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> (not shown); results were again unchanged and measures of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> were even slightly stronger. Overall, we observed the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>:
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) improvement in both inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors with decreased
        intensity of smoking, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) improvement in inflammatory markers with increased time since
        smoking cessation.
      
      
        Discussion
        In this cross-sectional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based study, we were able to demonstrate dose effects
        from smoking and temporal effects from cigarette smoking cessation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">NHANES III</ENAMEX> dataset
        allowed us to utilize both self-reported smoking and serum cotinine levels to minimize
        misclassification error. It also allowed us to control for a wide range of confounders and
        assess consistency across measures by analyzing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> acute phase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and several
        traditional risk factors. By examining both traditional risk factors and inflammatory
        markers of cardiovascular risk, this study contributes to the literature by providing a
        more complete analysis with regard to the effects of smoking and smoking cessation.
        It is known that after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> give up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX>, their risk of mortality and future
        cardiac events declines [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,39</NUMEX>], but there is little data quantifying the rate of risk
        reduction and when, or even whether, cardiovascular risk for former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> reaches that of
        never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,40,41</NUMEX>]. We found that the smoking-associated inflammatory response
        subsides within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 y</TIMEX> after smoking cessation. This suggests that the vascular effects are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reversible</ENAMEX> and that cardiovascular risk subsides gradually with reduced exposure. The time
        to risk factor ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù was longest with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>; only one traditional risk
        factor‚Äîtriglycerides‚Äîshowed a similar pattern. Our findings are consistent with prior
        studies, suggesting that the full benefit of smoking cessation may be achieved gradually
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39,42,43</NUMEX>].
        Our estimates of the time to risk factor ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù are shorter than those for the
        decline in mortality risk and risk for specific cardiac events reported in some prospective
        studies [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,44</NUMEX>], but on par with those in other prospective [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>], case-control [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,47</NUMEX>], and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-sectional</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>] studies. Discrepancies may be due to smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">recidivism</ENAMEX> in prospective
        studies, where former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> recommence <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking</ENAMEX> and increase their risk, such that the
        reported time since cessation is longer than the true time, or due to a lag between changes
        in cardiovascular risk factors and regression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Additionally, one would expect
        morbidity risk to subside <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, since mortality is a more distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endpoint</ENAMEX>. Prior studies
        also did not control for known cardiovascular risk factors, did not use serum cotinine
        levels, did not examine the associated change in inflammatory markers post-cessation, or
        grouped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> into broad categories of current, former, and never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>,
        increasing residual confounding while failing to explore the relative effects within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,12,49</NUMEX>]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>'s ongoing
        decline in former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> simply indicates a prevalent underlying burden of atherosclerotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plaque</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúsimmering‚Äù ongoing disease</ENAMEX> processes. The direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>reactive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with mortality decrement seen in these other studies‚Äîand the dose‚Äìresponse seen in
        our own study‚Äîsuggest the latter.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> studies have systematically examined inflammatory markers following smoking: the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MONICA Study</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monitoring Trends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Determinants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiovascular Disease</ENAMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>], the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiovascular Health Study</ENAMEX> (CHS) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>], and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwick Park Heart Study</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiovascular Health Study</ENAMEX> found no association between inflammatory markers and smoking
        status itself, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> was strongly related to lifetime smoking
        exposure as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack-years</ENAMEX>. Our results, while based on more complete modeling,
        support findings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Northwick Park Heart Study and MONICA Study</ENAMEX>, both of which found
        that fibrinogen levels (adjusted only for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>) reached normal levels within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 y.</TIMEX>
        Our study supports the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk falls with inflammatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abatement</ENAMEX>, and that inflammatory markers are better indicators of such risk reduction. In
        this analysis, triglycerides showed the strongest dose-intensity and temporal trends of the
        traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This is both consistent with prior research and
        not surprising since the strongest association between <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> and lipid
        measures is for triglycerides. Despite the colinearity, the inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> studied
        appear to have a much clearer trend and longer lasting effect after smoking cessation than
        traditional risk factors. This would suggest their greater utility in being more accurate
        markers of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, particularly given <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>'s increasingly apparent role in
        the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Alternative explanations include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the presence of
        multiple independent causal pathways leading to cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) traditional
        risk factors correlating more closely with mortality than <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> or underlying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathophysiology</ENAMEX>. The relative value of novel inflammatory markers versus traditional risk
        factors remains of much debate [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,51</NUMEX>].
        Limitations of this study include measurement error from self-reporting, residual
        confounding from use of indicator variables, smoking recidivism, lack of newer measures
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interleukin-6</ENAMEX> and high-sensitivity <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>], and lack of data on
        secondhand smoke. Recent studies have suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> exposures from secondhand smoke
        may impact the biomarkers used in this study [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53,54</NUMEX>]. We attempted to adjust for bias in
        self-reporting and secondhand exposure by using serum cotinine levels, but residual
        confounding may exist. It has also been suggested that circulating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>reactive protein
        levels may not reflect all relevant inflammatory effectors, owing to post-transcriptional
        regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. We chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>, however, for its clear
        role in the inflammatory response and for its increasing clinical relevance. Lastly, it is
        noteworthy that we are not using a linear scale, but measures of both intensity and
        duration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> since cessation and cigarettes per day are distinctly different measures,
        and a discontinuity arises at cessation.
        Further research should explore the acute phase response in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> following smoking
        cessation [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53,55‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äì57</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> intervals of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a year</TIMEX> since cessation have not been
        assessed adequately in other studies nor in this study because of sample size limitations
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHANES III</ENAMEX> data. Additionally, if cardiovascular risk subsides gradually upon
        smoking cessation, do vessel wall damage and pro-aggregatory cascades all completely
        reverse course upon cessation? Future research should continue to explore the relationship
        between the inflammatory cascade and alterations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> wall [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,58</NUMEX>].
        This and other similar studies suggest that smoking cessation should play a larger role
        in public policy. Linked to poverty, decreased productivity, and premature death, tobacco
        remains the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major cause of preventable death in the world and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> most common
        risk factor for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> worldwide [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. While <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> is clearly a worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and localities are left responsible for addressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use and smoking in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> manner. Our results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policy-makers</ENAMEX> faced with escalating
        health-care costs should look to smoking cessation as an opportunity to achieve both long-
        and short
        - term health-care cost savings through cardiovascular risk reduction
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>]. If cardiovascular benefits are, in fact, readily attainable, there exists an
        opportunity for short-term gain from smoking cessation. This may be sufficient to induce
        policy change. Larger scale action is also needed. Arguments persist in the developing
        world regarding the forced opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> markets as a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global Agreements</ENAMEX>
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guidance</ENAMEX> may be forthcoming, however, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</ENAMEX>, which began operation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> as an international treaty aimed at controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> packaging, marketing, and use
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are currently <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framework Convention on Tobacco</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>, including many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has yet to
        approve this treaty. Opportunities for tobacco control remain available, and it is becoming
        increasingly clear that smoking cessation models deserve high priority both in research and
        in any preventive health care system.
