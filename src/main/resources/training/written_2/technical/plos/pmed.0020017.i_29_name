        Genes of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ERBB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinases that mediate cellular
        responses to growth signals. Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ERBB genes</ENAMEX>, 
        epidermal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> (EGFR) and 
        HER2, have been found in a proportion of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,4</NUMEX>].
        For 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX>, mutations are associated with sensitivity to the small-molecule
        kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors gefitinib</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iressa</ENAMEX>) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>] and erlotinib (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarceva</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        ERBB signaling pathways include downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTPases</ENAMEX> encoded by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAS genes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 15%‚Äì30%</NUMEX> of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> contain activating
        mutations in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> member 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> . These mutations are most frequently found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">codons 12 and 13</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon 2</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,6</NUMEX>], and may be associated with unfavorable outcomes [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. Interestingly, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and 
        KRAS mutations are rarely found in the same tumors, suggesting that they
        have functionally equivalent roles in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> ([<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Meyerson</ENAMEX>, personal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, 
        EGFR mutations are common in tumors from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have smoked less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">than 100</ENAMEX> cigarettes in their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lifetimes (‚Äúnever smokers‚Äù</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], while 
        KRAS mutations more commonly occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with a history of
        substantial cigarette use [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        We sought to determine whether 
        KRAS mutations could also be used to predict primary sensitivity or
        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We systematically evaluated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> lung adenocarcinomas
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with known responses to either of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for the presence of mutations
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> (exons <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 through 21</TIMEX>) and 
        KRAS2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 2</ENAMEX>). Here, we show that mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> are associated with primary resistance to single-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> gefitinib or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erlotinib</ENAMEX>. Our results suggest that a determination of mutational status for both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> may help define which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are likely to benefit from receiving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gefitinib</ENAMEX> or erlotinib.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tissue Procurement</ENAMEX>
          Tumor specimens were obtained through protocols approved by the institutional review
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</ENAMEX>, as previously described [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protocols S1‚ÄìS3</ENAMEX>). Tumor material, obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> prior to kinase inhibitor
          treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>, was collected retrospectively for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on gefitinib, who
          received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> mg or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> mg orally once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>), and prospectively for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on erlotinib, who received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>
          mg orally once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>). The latter cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was part of a clinical trial of
          erlotinib for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. The analysis presented here
          includes specimens we previously reported on (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> for gefitinib and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> for erlotinib) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
          All specimens were reviewed by a single reference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">(M. F. Z.</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imaging</ENAMEX>
          studies were assessed by a single reference radiologist (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. T. H.</ENAMEX>), who graded responses
          according to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors</ENAMEX> (RECIST) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>
          were blinded to patient outcomes.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with tumors sensitive to gefitinib had objective partial
          responses as defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECIST</ENAMEX>, i.e., at least a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> decrease in the sum of the longest
          diameters of target <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, taking as reference the sum measured at baseline. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had marked clinical improvement, as ascertained by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent reviewing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> and manifested by lessened dyspnea and cancer-related pain. However, this
          individual had radiographic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> (pleural and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone metastases</ENAMEX>) that were deemed
          nonmeasurable by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECIST</ENAMEX> criteria. As erlotinib-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were all in a clinical
          trial, all had disease measurable using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECIST</ENAMEX> guidelines. For both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in this study,
          tumors were considered refractory if they did not undergo sufficient shrinkage to qualify
          for partial response. This definition includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose ‚Äúbest overall response‚Äù was
          either progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>) or stable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>) as defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECIST</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a complete response.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutational Analyses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lung Tumors</ENAMEX>
          Genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from tumors embedded in paraffin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, except for tumor
          109T, which was a fresh-frozen tumor specimen. Primers for 
          EGFR analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exons 18‚Äì21</ENAMEX>) were as published [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. For 
          KRAS analyses, the following nested primer sets for exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were used:
          huKRAS2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ex2F</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤- GAATGGTCCTGCACCAGTAA-3‚Ä≤; huKRAS2 ex2R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤- GTGTGACATGTTCTAATATAGTCA-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>;
          huKRAS2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ex2Fint</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤- GTCCTGCACCAGTAATATGC-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">huKRAS2 ex2Rint</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5‚</NUMEX>Ä≤-
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATGTTCTAATATAGTCACATTTTC-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>.
          For both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HotStarTaq Master Mix Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valencia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), as per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. Use of this
          method often obviated the need for nested PCR sets. All sequencing reactions were
          performed in both forward and reverse directions, and all mutations were confirmed by PCR
          amplification of an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> isolate.
          In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> cases, exon 19 deletions were also studied by length analysis of fluorescently
          labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products on a capillary electrophoresis device, using the following primers: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFR -Ex19-FWD1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤- GCACCATCTCACAATTGCCAGTTA-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFR -Ex19-REV1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤-Fam- AAAAGGTGGGCCTGAGGTTCA-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>. Using serial
          dilutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H1650</TIMEX> non-small-cell lung cancer cell line (exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          deletion-positive [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]), this assay detects the mutant allele when H1650 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>
          or more of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tested, compared to a sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> for direct sequencing.
          These same cases were also screened for the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> L858R mutation by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR‚</ENAMEX>Äìrestriction
          fragment length polymorphism assay, based on a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sau96I</ENAMEX> restriction site created by the
          L858R mutation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,573T‚ÜíG</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Sau96I</NUMEX>-digested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were
          analyzed by capillary electrophoresis, and the following primers were used: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFR -Ex21-FWD1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤- CCTCACAGCAGGGTCTTCTCTGT-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EGFR -Ex21-REV1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5‚Ä≤-Fam- TCAGGAAAATGCTGGCTGACCTA-3‚Ä≤</ENAMEX>. Using serial
          dilutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H1975</TIMEX> cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">L858R</NUMEX>-positive [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]), this assay detects the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> allele when H1975 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> or more of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> tested, compared to a
          sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> for direct sequencing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Q. Pan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Pao</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Ladanyi</ENAMEX>, unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Statistics
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exact Test</ENAMEX> was used to calculate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>- values, and confidence intervals were calculated using 
          Statistics with Confidence software [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        Results
        We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with tumors shown to be
        sensitive or refractory to single-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> gefitinib or erlotinib and evaluated these tumors
        for mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> . Collectively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) tumors refractory to either kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> had 
        KRAS mutations, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>) drug-sensitive tumors had such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX> (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals (CIs) for these
        observations are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì39% and 0%‚Äì16%</NUMEX>, respectively. Conversely, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX>) tumors
        sensitive to either kinase inhibitor had 
        EGFR mutations, in contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>) drug-resistant tumors (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.8</NUMEX> √ó <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">‚àí11</NUMEX> ). The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIs</ENAMEX> for these observed response rates are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì90%</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì9%</NUMEX>, respectively. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> tumors with 
        EGFR mutations responded to gefitinib or erlotinib, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all nine</NUMEX> tumors
        with 
        KRAS mutations did not (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX> √ó <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">‚àí7</NUMEX> ).
        Correlation of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> mutational status with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and treatment response is detailed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The spectrum of 
        KRAS mutations is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Results with gefitinib
        and erlotinib were similar overall. However, the incidence of 
        KRAS mutations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with erlotinib was low, probably
        because of the fact that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> had bronchioloalveolar
        carcinoma, which rarely has 
        RAS mutations [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Alternatively, our analyses involving only exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of 
        KRAS2 may have missed some 
        RAS mutations. However, in our analysis of the exonic regions encoding
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> surgically resected early-stage non-small-cell lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>,
        we have found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> mutations, and all were in either codon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> or codon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>, encoded by exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Pao</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Wilson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Varmus</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). Another possibility is that the
        erlotinib-treated tumors have mutations in other 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RAS genes</ENAMEX>, since a minority of 
        RAS mutations in lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> have been reported to occur in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRAS</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,6</NUMEX>].
      
      
        Discussion
        These results have important clinical implications. First, they extend previous data
        from our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and others showing that lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> containing 
        EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> in this series; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> observed response rate; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì100%</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> show that tumors with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mutations (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) are associated with a lack of response to these kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX> observed response rate; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì30%</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, no drug-sensitive tumors had 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mutations (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>). Whether 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> mutational status can be used to predict responses to gefitinib or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erlotinib</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose tumors have wild-type 
        EGFR sequence is still under investigation: our analysis comparing
        response rates for tumors with neither 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> nor 
        KRAS mutations versus tumors with wild-type 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> but mutated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> does not reach statistical significance (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.29</NUMEX>). Nevertheless, these findings suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose lung
        adenocarcinomas have 
        KRAS mutations will not experience significant tumor regression with
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>.
        The incidence of 
        EGFR mutations in tumors responsive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> has varied
        from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71% to 100%</NUMEX> ([<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3</NUMEX>] and this paper). Thus, at this point, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose tumors test
        negative for 
        EGFR mutations should not necessarily be precluded from treatment with
        either gefitinib or erlotinib. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> presented here suggest that clinical decisions
        regarding the use of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinomas</ENAMEX> might be improved
        in the future by pre-treatment mutational profiling of both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> . These findings warrant validation in large prospective trials
        using standardized mutation detection techniques.
