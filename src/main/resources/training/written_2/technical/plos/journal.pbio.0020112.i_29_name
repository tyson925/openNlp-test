        enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> to eat, the main food risk is starvation. But if you ask, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜When</ENAMEX> does food
        actually kill?â€™ in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, â€˜Not that oftenâ€™ is the short
        reply you would give after reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Pennington</ENAMEX>'s book 
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Kills</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, 
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Disaster Science</ENAMEX> . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> food-borne <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that occupy much of
        the book, 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0157</TIMEX> and bovine spongiform encephalopathy
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>), kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> very rarely, although the ramifications and implications of these few
        deaths for science, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> are large.
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pennington</ENAMEX> clearly explains, there is still much uncertainty in the science of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>,
        and the eventual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> death toll from the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">form</ENAMEX> may be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as a few hundred</NUMEX>, with
        even the most pessimistic expert assessments putting the upper bound as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 5,000</NUMEX>.
        Food-borne 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0157</TIMEX> kills <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whilst</ENAMEX> each death is a terrible tragedy and an indescribably harrowing experience for
        those close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>, these figures are small when compared with other ways in which
        food kills. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiologists</ENAMEX> estimate that the dietary contributions to cardiovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> between them kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>. Yet we
        hear much more about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> as food risks. For instance, a recent study by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fund</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kingsfund</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/pdf/healthinthenewssummary.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pdf</ENAMEX>) reports that the
        rate of news coverage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK</ENAMEX> of a death from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the
        human form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 23,000</NUMEX> times that for a death from obesity.
        In his characteristically diverting and obscurely erudite way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pennington</ENAMEX> describes this
        discrepancy between public perception and magnitude of risk by referring to an article on
        railway accidents published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dionysius Lardner</ENAMEX>. The systematic and much more
        revealing analyses of risk perception by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Slovic</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 25</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> do not get a mention.
        In fact, one of the hallmarks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennington</ENAMEX>'s style is his enthusiasm for taking his
        reader down little-known historical byways. Whether it be the drowning (possibly suicide)
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ludwig II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bavaria</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starnberger See</ENAMEX> or the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Norris</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethlehem Lunatic Asylum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennington</ENAMEX> has an almost endless supply of anecdotes to
        provide peripheral colour to his main narrative. Indeed, on some occasions his delight in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX> makes it hard to see where the main narrative is leading, although his aim is to
        show that similar conclusions can be drawn about risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, transport, oil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rigs</ENAMEX>, and other fields.
        Anyone who has heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Pennington</ENAMEX> speak will know that he has a remarkably direct and
        engaging style, which he translates into the written word with verve. Already on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, he
        gets us into the mood by referring to a sample from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> sent for analysis
        at the start of the Lanarkshire 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> outbreak of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜It was a stool. The word carries the
        impression of firmness, even of deliberate effort in its production. Hers was notâ€™. His
        laconic sense of humour is also reflected in many of the wittily irrelevant or tangential
        photographs. My personal favourites are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜Her Majesty</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glovesâ</ENAMEX>€™ on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> and â€˜Turds on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campsite Trackâ</ENAMEX>€™ on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>.
        The Lanarkshire 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0157</TIMEX> outbreak, which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1996</TIMEX> affected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX> people
        and killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>, was very much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennington</ENAMEX>'s show. He chaired the public enquiry that led
        eventually to a change in the law, requiring all butchers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> handling cooked and raw
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> to be licensed. The license itself is less important than the training in food safety
        management principles that precedes it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Barr</ENAMEX> (and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>), whose shop
        was the primary source of the outbreak, apparently did not know that you have to keep raw
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and ready-to-eat products separate to avoid cross-contamination with dangerous
        pathogens, such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0157</TIMEX>, that can occur in raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennington</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authoritative</ENAMEX> and blow-by-blow account shows failings not only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX> (who was,
        incidentally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Master Butcher</ENAMEX> of the Year in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>), but also in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> who
        had visited his shop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous two years</TIMEX>. They had not, apparently,
        picked up that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> employed the same knives for cutting up raw and cooked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, nor that they used a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜biodegradableâ€™</ENAMEX> cleaning fluid, not realising that this is not
        the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€˜biocidalâ€™</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> theme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>, is given somewhat shorter treatment. Nevertheless, Pennington
        goes into some detail in assessing the prion theory of transmissible spongiform
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encephalopathies</ENAMEX> (he argues that a nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is not also involved). He also reviews the
        sequence of events that led the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX> to conclude that there was
        not likely to be a risk to human health and to be slow to change its view. This and the
        concluding part of the book (see below) draw heavily on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Enquiry</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX>.
        Although this enquiry focussed on the response of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, its lessons are
        relevant to other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSE</ENAMEX> has emerged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, including many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
        In his book 
        Mountains of the Mind , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Macfarlane</ENAMEX> writes: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜[F]or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> risk
        wasn't optionalâ€”it came with the job. I sought risk out, however. I courted, in fact paid
        for it. This is the great shift which has taken place in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">riskâ€¦</ENAMEX>. [I]t became
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">commodityâ€™</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennington</ENAMEX> reflects a similar shift in attitude to food risk over the past
        half <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> or so. Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX>, although it was known that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> died from drinking raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, the risk was not seen as large enough to warrant
        legislation to make pasteurisation compulsory. We are now used to much higher standards of
        food safety, and we can, as a society, enjoy the luxury of fear of relatively minor
        risks.
        Nevertheless, there are important lessons from past failures for all involved in food
        safety (and in other areas of risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennington</ENAMEX> discusses some of these in
        his concluding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>. He emphasises the need to continually review the evidence
        underpinning risk assessments, to communicate effectively with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, to ensure that
        actions to manage risks are effectively implemented and audited. Notably, he refers to the
        importance of inclusiveness and openness about risk and uncertainty in decision-making:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€˜</ENAMEX>[<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">I</ENAMEX>]f [this] becomes the norm, it will be possible to say that good has come out of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tragedyâ€™.</ENAMEX>
