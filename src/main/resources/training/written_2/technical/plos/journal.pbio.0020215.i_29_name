        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organised</ENAMEX> and functional tissues. Cells communicate with each other in various ways, such
        as by secreting and receiving diffusible molecules (morphogens, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurotransmitters</ENAMEX>) or by establishing intercellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> (gap junctions and cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protrusions</ENAMEX>) to allow a direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of instructive factors. A recent paper has shown
        that communication via tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX> might be a more common mechanism than
        previously expected (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        Many different types of cell extensions have been described in a variety of
        developmental processes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chou</ENAMEX> and Chien
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; Rorth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), and for most of them a role in cell-to-cell communication has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypothesized</ENAMEX>. For example, in the mouse, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salas-Vidal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lomeli</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) have described long
        processes (filopodia) that connect tissues in early embryos. Because these protrusions
        contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for some well-known signalling molecules, it is thought that they might
        be responsible for receiving signals from neighbouring cells. Similarly, it has been
        proposed in the development of the 
        Drosophila <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and eye imaginal discs (precursors of adult
        structures) that signals modulating the growth and patterning of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> epithelial layer of
        cells are received through microtubule-based cell extensions arising from the apposing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cho et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schubiger 2000).</ENAMEX> Furthermore, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> imaginal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disc</ENAMEX>, planar extensions called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytonemes</ENAMEX> arise from the periphery of the epithelium and
        grow towards a central area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> disc that produces the signalling molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decapentaplegic</ENAMEX>. This directionality of growth, and the observation of vesicles inside
        cytonemes, led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramirez-Weber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kornberg</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) to propose that cells meant to receive a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> were searching actively for it, extending long cell protrusions towards the region
        from which signals were emanating.
        Although cell protrusions have been described in different developmental processes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, their potential role in cell signalling has been difficult to pin
        down. Most cell processes are very fragile, and their study is mainly limited to live
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>; in these conditions it is technically challenging to define how the signalling is
        mediated via protrusions. Possibly, it could occur through the release of free molecules,
        in a similar manner to synaptic neurotransmission, or shedding of vesicles as exosomes
        followed by endocytosis by the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, membranetethered ligands
        (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>) on the protrusion could bind and activate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> displayed on the
        surface of the receiving cell (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Joussineau et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>).
        The paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> has provided a new outlook on the role of cell
        protrusions, by reporting a novel mechanism employed to transmit signals between cells
        connected by a protrusion. Surprisingly, they did not observe any of the mechanisms
        described above. Rather, transfer of molecules and organelles occurred directly from the
        cytoplasm of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> to the other, passing through a protrusion that established membrane
        continuity between the connected cells.
        Using rat PC12 cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> observed ultrafine protrusions (with a
        diameter of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 50–200</NUMEX> nm and a length spanning several cell diameters) connecting sparse
        cells in culture (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Similar to other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, termed
        tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), displayed a pronounced sensitivity to both mechanical stress
        and chemical fixation and even to prolonged light excitation, resulting in the rupture of
        many of them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> are actin-based and devoid of microtubules: interestingly most other
        types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX> also contain actin (Condeelis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rorth 2003).</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        also confirmed the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> in a human cell line (human embryonic kidney cells)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (normal rat kidney cells), suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> are not a peculiarity
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PC12</NUMEX> cells.
        Aiming to investigate how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> were linking cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> performed scanning and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission electron</ENAMEX> microscopy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX>. They observed a seamless transition between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX>
        and the cells they were connected to, suggesting that indeed there was continuity between
        the membranes of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> connected cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> then went on to test
        whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> could be used to transmit signals between cells. The experimental approach
        used was to mark <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of cells in a distinct way, either by introducing genes
        that encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> tagged with green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or by using dyes. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        different cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> were then mixed, cocultured, and analysed for transfer of marked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or dye-stained organelles from one cell to another, between cells that were
        differently marked and connected by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strikingly</ENAMEX>, soluble cytoplasmic molecules could
        not pass freely along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> (with actin tagged with green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> being the
        only exception), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane-bound proteins</ENAMEX> were transferred along <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> and detected
        in the receiving cells, further supporting the likelihood of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">membrane</TIMEX> continuity between
        connected cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> also observed transport of vesicles, which seemed to
        be unidirectional. Finally, in transfer experiments performed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to 0</NUMEX> °C, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">endo-</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">exo-</ENAMEX>, and phagocytosis would be blocked, vesicle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> still occurred, suggesting
        that these events are not required for vesicle transfer and further supporting the idea
        that membrane continuity exists between connected cells. By contrast, interfering with
        actin polymerization, using the drug latrunculin-B, led to protrusion removal and arrest in
        organelle transfer, indicating that actin is required both for protrusion biogenesis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organelle</ENAMEX> transport.
        Taken together, the experiments performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> strongly suggest a
        role for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX> in cell-to-cell communication. They also provide evidence, in
        culture, for a novel mechanism used by cell protrusions to transport molecules and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organelles</ENAMEX>. It will be interesting to test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> also exist in living tissues and,
        if so, what molecules they transport. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> could be distinct from the protrusions known so
        far and could be responsible for establishing another type of connection between cells.
        They could connect all cells in a tissue, directly or indirectly, establishing a global
        interaction network potentially important in exchanging basic survival information as well
        as positional cues (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milan et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
        Another interesting question is how connections such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNTs</ENAMEX> are established. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom et</ENAMEX>
        al. have shown that, initially, many filopodial extensions arise from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> toward a neighbour. As soon as one of them reaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, it is stabilised,
        while the others degenerate. It is possible that membrane fusion occurs between the tip of
        the protrusion and the planar plasma membrane of the target cell. However, membrane fusion
        can be more easily achieved if the tips of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX> fuse with each other, thus
        suggesting the participation, in the process of membrane fusion, of microvilli or other
        tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">protrusions</ENAMEX> belonging to the target cell. Fusion between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">protrusions</ENAMEX> is reported
        to rely on the cylindrical shape and narrow diameter of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX> and also on the
        localised concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesion</ENAMEX>/fusion molecules at the tips of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX>,
        such as microvilli, that display particular tip-specific membrane microdomains (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monck</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernandez</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Snell</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roper et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). The work performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell protrusions</ENAMEX> are a general mechanism for cell-to-cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and that information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> is occurring through the direct membrane
        continuity of connected cells, independently of exo- and endocytosis. It is important to
        determine whether events similar to these seen in cell culture are occurring in tissues and
        what functions cell protrusions perform during tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>.
        In my work as a graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, I am trying to address this question. We need to
        identify the types of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> protrusions that are present in tissues and the molecular
        complexes localizing on them as well as their functions. To then prove that cell
        protrusions are important in cell-to-cell communication in tissues, we would need to remove
        the protrusions and see how this affects tissue architecture and function. However, the
        necessary tools are still missing, given the lack of knowledge of the specific molecules
        important for the biogenesis of these protrusions. Thus far, the function of cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protrusions</ENAMEX> has been hypothesized mainly on the basis of their location in tissues and on
        crude attempts to remove them, for example by altering the actin cytoskeleton or even by
        removing the entire epithelium they belong to.
        The paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rustom et al.</ENAMEX> has shed some new light on these still mysterious cellular
        arms and has further boosted my interest in this emerging field of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and developmental
        biology.
