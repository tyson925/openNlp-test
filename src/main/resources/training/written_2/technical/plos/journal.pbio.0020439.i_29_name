        explosive synergy between biology and mathematics seems poised to enrich and extend both
        fields greatly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming decades</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; Jungck <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> et al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palmer et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmer 2003).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biology</ENAMEX> will increasingly stimulate
        the creation of qualitatively new realms of mathematics. Why? In biology, ensemble
        properties emerge at each level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> from the interactions of heterogeneous
        biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at that level and at lower and higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (larger and
        smaller physical scales, faster and slower temporal scales). New mathematics will be
        required to cope with these ensemble properties and with the heterogeneity of the
        biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that compose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ensembles</ENAMEX> at each level.
        The discovery of the microscope in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 17th century</TIMEX> caused a revolution in biology
        by revealing otherwise invisible and previously unsuspected worlds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> cosmology from
        classical times through the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> envisioned a system with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of
        spheres: the sphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, exemplified by his imperfectly round <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>; the sphere of the
        world, exemplified by the imperfectly spherical earth; and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> perfect spheres of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">universe</ENAMEX>, in which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> (then known) planets moved and the outer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> were fixed
        (Nicolson <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>). The discovery of a microbial world too small to be seen by the naked eye
        challenged the completeness of this cosmology and unequivocally demonstrated the existence
        of living creatures unknown to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scriptures of Old World</ENAMEX> religions.
        Mathematics broadly interpreted is a more general microscope. It can reveal otherwise
        invisible worlds in all kinds of data, not only optical. For example, computed tomography
        can reveal a cross-section of a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> from the density of X-ray beams without ever
        opening the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radon</ENAMEX> transform to infer the densities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> at each
        location within the head (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh 2003).</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Darwin</ENAMEX> was right when he wrote that people
        with an understanding “of the great leading principles of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mathematics…</ENAMEX> seem to have an
        extra sense” (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Darwin 1905).</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> increasingly recognize that appropriate
        mathematics can help interpret any kind of data. In this sense, mathematics is biology's
        next microscope, only better.
        Conversely, mathematics will benefit increasingly from its involvement with biology,
        just as mathematics has already benefited and will continue to benefit from its historic
        involvement with physical problems. In classical times, physics, as first an applied then a
        basic science, stimulated enormous advances in mathematics. For example, geometry reveals
        by its very etymology (geometry) its origin in the needs to survey the lands and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geometry</ENAMEX> was used to lay out fields in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> after the flooding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX>, to aid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">navigation</ENAMEX>, to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> planning. The inventions of the calculus by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Newton</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gottfried Leibniz</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later 17th century</TIMEX> were stimulated by physical problems such as
        planetary orbits and optical calculations.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming century</TIMEX>, biology will stimulate the creation of entirely new realms of
        mathematics. In this sense, biology is mathematics' next physics, only better. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biology</ENAMEX> will
        stimulate fundamentally new mathematics because living nature is qualitatively more
        heterogeneous than non-living nature. For example, it is estimated that there are
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000–5,000 species</NUMEX> of rocks and minerals in the earth's crust, generated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>
        or so naturally occurring elements (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shipman et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 21</ENAMEX> estimates 2,000
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minerals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s crust). By contrast, there are probably <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 3 million</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
        million biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, generated from a small fraction of the naturally
        occurring elements. If species of rocks and minerals may validly be compared with species
        of living <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, the living world has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least a thousand</NUMEX> times the diversity of the
        non-living. This comparison omits the enormous evolutionary importance of individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> within species. Coping with the hyper-diversity of life at every scale of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> and temporal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> will require fundamental conceptual advances in
        mathematics.
      
      
        The Past
        The interactions between mathematics and biology at present follow from their
        interactions over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last half millennium</TIMEX>. The discovery of the New World by Europeans
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500 years</TIMEX> ago—and of its many biological species not described in religious
        Scriptures—gave impetus to major conceptual progress in biology.
        The outstanding milestone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> history of biological quantitation was the work
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Harvey</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exercitatio Anatomica De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis In Animalibus</ENAMEX> (An
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Anatomical Disquisition on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey 1847)</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1628</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX>'s demonstration that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood circulates</ENAMEX> was the pivotal
        founding event of the modern interaction between mathematics and biology. His elegant
        reasoning is worth understanding.
        From the time of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131–201</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.E.</ENAMEX>) until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Harvey</ENAMEX>
        studied <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Padua</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1600–1602</NUMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> was active there), it was believed that
        there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and venous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. Both kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> were
        believed to ebb and flow under the motive power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, just as the tides of the
        earth ebbed and flowed under the motive power of the moon. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. He used his position of privilege to dissect <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> from the king's deer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> as well as executed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> observed that the veins in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> have
        one-way valves that permit blood to flow from the periphery toward the heart but not in the
        reverse direction. Hence the theory that the blood ebbs and flows in both veins and
        arteries could not be correct.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> also observed that the heart was a contractile muscle with one-way valves between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> on each side. He measured the volume of the left ventricle of dead human
        hearts and found that it held <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about two ounces</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 60 ml</NUMEX>), varying from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 to three</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ounces</ENAMEX> in different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. He estimated that at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-eighth</NUMEX> and perhaps as much
        as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-quarter</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the left ventricle was expelled with each stroke of the
        heart. He measured that the heart beat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60–100</NUMEX> times per minute. Therefore, the volume of
        blood expelled from the left <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ventricle per hour</NUMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 60 ml × 1/8</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> beats/minute ×
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes/hour</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liters</ENAMEX>/hour. However, the average human has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5.5</NUMEX> liters of blood
        (a quantity that could be estimated by draining a cadaver). Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> must be
        like a stage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> that marches off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the stage, returns behind the scenes, and
        reenters from the other side of the stage, again and again. The large volume of blood
        pumped <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per hour</NUMEX> could not possibly be accounted for by the then-prevalent theory that the
        blood originated from the consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> inferred that there must be some
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> that conveyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from the outgoing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> to the returning veins,
        but he was not able to see those small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>. His theoretical prediction, based on his
        meticulous anatomical observations and his mathematical calculations, was spectacularly
        confirmed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century later</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcello Malpighi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1628–1694</ENAMEX>) saw the
        capillaries under a microscope. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX>'s discovery illustrates the enormous power of
        simple, off-the-shelf mathematics combined with careful observation and clear reasoning. It
        set a high standard for all later uses of mathematics in biology.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathematics</ENAMEX> was crucial in the discovery of genes by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mendel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orel 1984) and</ENAMEX> in the
        theory of evolution. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathematics</ENAMEX> was and continues to be the principal means of integrating
        evolution and genetics since the classic work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. A. Fisher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. B. S. Haldane</ENAMEX>, and S.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of the 20th century</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Provine 2001).</ENAMEX>
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 500 years</TIMEX>, mathematics has made amazing progress in each of its three
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>: geometry and topology, algebra, and analysis. This progress has enriched all
        the biological sciences.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1637</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">René Descartes</ENAMEX> linked the featureless <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> geometry to the symbols
        and formulas of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> algebra by imposing a coordinate system (conventionally, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">horizontal x-</ENAMEX>axis and a vertical y-axis) on the geometric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> and using numbers to
        measure distances between points. If every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> who plotted data on x–y coordinates
        acknowledged the contribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descartes</ENAMEX> to biological understanding, the key role of
        mathematics in biology would be uncontested.
        Another highlight of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last five centuries</TIMEX> of geometry was the invention of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Euclidean</ENAMEX> geometries (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1823–1830</ENAMEX>). Shocking at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, these geometries unshackled the
        possibilities of mathematical reasoning from the intuitive perception of space. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Euclidean</ENAMEX> geometries have made significant contributions to biology in facilitating,
        for example, mapping the brain onto a flat surface (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurdal et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowers</ENAMEX> and Hurdal
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>).
        In algebra, efforts to find the roots of equations led to the discovery of the
        symmetries of roots of equations and thence to the invention of group theory, which finds
        routine application in the study of crystallographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        Generalizations of single linear equations to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of simultaneous multi-variable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> equations stimulated the development of linear algebra and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> re-invention
        and naming of matrices in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>. The use of a matrix of numbers to solve
        simultaneous systems of linear equations can be traced back in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> mathematics to the
        period from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.C.E.</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.E.</ENAMEX> (in a work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiu Chang Suan Shu</ENAMEX> called 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chapters of the Mathematical Art</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoller 2001).</ENAMEX> In the 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, matrices were considered the epitome of useless mathematical abstraction. Then, in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, it was discovered, for example, that the numerical processes required for
        the cohort-component method of population projection can be conveniently summarized and
        executed using matrices (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keyfitz 1968).</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the use of matrices is routine in agencies
        responsible for making official population projections as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-biological
        research on human and nonhuman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caswell 2001).</ENAMEX>
        Finally, analysis, including the calculus of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leibniz</ENAMEX> and probability theory,
        is the line between ancient thought and modern thought. Without an understanding of the
        concepts of analysis, especially the concept of a limit, it is not possible to grasp much
        of modern science, technology, or economic theory. Those who understand the calculus,
        ordinary and partial differential equations, and probability theory have a way of seeing
        and understanding the world, including the biological world, that is unavailable to those
        who do not.
        Conceptual and scientific challenges from biology have enriched mathematics by leading
        to innovative thought about new kinds of mathematics. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> lists examples of new and
        useful mathematics arising from problems in the life sciences broadly construed, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> and some social sciences. Many of these developments blend smoothly into their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antecedents</ENAMEX> and later elaborations. For example, game theory has a history before the work
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John von Neumann</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Neumann</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Neumann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Morgenstern 1953</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearson</ENAMEX>'s development of the correlation coefficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee 1903)</ENAMEX> rested on
        earlier work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Galton</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>).
      
      
        The Present
        To see how the interactions of biology and mathematics may proceed in the future, it is
        helpful to map the present landscapes of biology and applied mathematics.
        The biological landscape may be mapped as a rectangular table with different rows for
        different questions and different columns for different biological domains. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biology</ENAMEX> asks
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> kinds of questions. How is it built? How does it work? What goes wrong? How is it
        fixed? How did it begin? What is it for? These are questions, respectively, about
        structures, mechanisms, pathologies, repairs, origins, and functions or purposes. The
        former teleological interpretation of purpose has been replaced by an evolutionary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>. Biological domains, or levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, include molecules, cells,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, organs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, ecosystems or landscapes, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosphere</ENAMEX>. Many biological research problems can be classified as the combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
        more questions directed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more domains.
        In addition, biological research questions have important dimensions of time and space.
        Timescales of importance to biology range from the extremely fast processes of
        photosynthesis to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of living evolution on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. Relevant spatial
        scales range from the molecular to the cosmic (cosmic rays may have played a role in
        evolution on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>). The questions and the domains of biology behave differently on
        different temporal and spatial scales. The opportunities and the challenges that biology
        offers mathematics arise because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at any given level of biological organization
        are heterogeneous, and the outcomes of their interactions (sometimes called “emergent
        phenomena” or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">“ensemble properties”</ENAMEX>) on any selected temporal and spatial scale may be
        substantially affected by the heterogeneity and interactions of biological components at
        lower and higher levels of biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and at smaller and larger temporal and
        spatial scales (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972, 1995</TIMEX>).
        The landscape of applied mathematics is better visualized as a tetrahedron (a pyramid
        with a triangular base) than as a matrix with temporal and spatial dimensions.
        (Mathematical imagery, such as a tetrahedron for applied mathematics and a matrix for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX>, is useful even in trying to visualize the landscapes of biology and mathematics.)
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main points of the applied mathematical landscape are data structures, algorithms,
        theories and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> (including all pure mathematics), and computers and software. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
        structures are ways to organize data, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix</ENAMEX> used above to describe the
        biological landscape. Algorithms are procedures for manipulating symbols. Some algorithms
        are used to analyze data, others to analyze models. Theories and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, including the
        theories of pure mathematics, are used to analyze both data and ideas. Mathematics and
        mathematical theories provide a testing ground for ideas in which the strength of competing
        theories can be measured. Computers and software are an important, and frequently the most
        visible, vertex of the applied mathematical landscape. However, cheap, easy computing
        increases the importance of theoretical understanding of the results of computation.
        Theoretical understanding is required as a check on the great risk of error in software,
        and to bridge the enormous gap between computational results and insight or
        understanding.
        The landscape of research in mathematics and biology contains all combinations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
        more biological questions, domains, time scales, and spatial scales with one or more data
        structures, algorithms, theories or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and means of computation (typically software
        and hardware). The following example from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> biology illustrates such a combination:
        the question, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">“how</ENAMEX> does it work?” is approached in the domain of cells (specifically, human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> cells) with algorithms for correlation and hierarchical clustering.
        
          Gene expression and drug activity in human cancer.
          Suppose a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Could information about the activities of the genes in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> guide the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> so that more
          effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are used and less effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are avoided? To suggest answers to this
          question, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scherf et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) ingeniously applied off-the-shelf mathematics,
          specifically, correlation—invented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century earlier</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Pearson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee 1903</ENAMEX>) in a study of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inheritance—and clustering algorithms</ENAMEX>, which apparently had
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of invention, including psychometrics (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson 1967).</ENAMEX> They applied these
          simple tools to extract useful information from, and to combine for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time,
          enormous databases on molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharmacology</ENAMEX> and gene expression
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://discover.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nci</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/arraytools/</ENAMEX>). They used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of information from the
          drug discovery program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>. The first kind of information
          described gene expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,375</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> human cancer cell lines. A target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix T</ENAMEX> had, as the numerical entry in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">row g and</ENAMEX> column c, the relative abundance of the
          mRNA transcript of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene g</ENAMEX> in cell line c. The drug activity matrix A summarized the
          pharmacology of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> acting on each of the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> human cancer cell lines,
          including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with “known mechanism of action.” The number in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">row</TIMEX> d and column c of
          the drug activity matrix A was the activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> d in suppressing the growth of cell
          line c, or, equivalently, the sensitivity of cell line c to drug <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">d. The target matrix T</ENAMEX>
          for gene expression contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82,500</NUMEX> numbers, while the drug activity matrix A had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84,000</NUMEX>
          numbers.
          These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matrices</ENAMEX> have the same set of column headings but have different row labels.
          Given the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> matrices, precisely <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sets of possible correlations could be calculated,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scherf et</ENAMEX> al. calculated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The correlation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different columns
          of the activity matrix A led to a clustering of cell lines according to their similarity
          of response to different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) The correlation between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different columns of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">target matrix T</ENAMEX> led to a clustering of the cell lines according to their similarity of
          gene expression. This clustering differed very substantially from the clustering of cell
          lines by drug sensitivity. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) The correlation between different rows of the activity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix A</ENAMEX> led to a clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> according to their activity patterns across all
          cell lines. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) The correlation between different rows of the target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix T</ENAMEX> led to a
          clustering of genes according to the pattern of mRNA expressed across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cell lines.
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) Finally, the correlation between a row of the activity matrix A and a row of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">target matrix T</ENAMEX> described the positive or negative covariation of drug activity with gene
          expression. A positive correlation meant that the higher the level of gene expression
          across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> cancer cell lines, the higher the effectiveness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> in suppressing
          the growth of those cell lines. The result of analyzing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred thousand</NUMEX>
          experiments is summarized in a single picture called a clustered image map (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          This clustered image map plots gene expression–drug activity correlations as a function
          of clustered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (horizontal axis) and clustered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (showing only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">“known function”</ENAMEX>) on the vertical axis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weinstein et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>).
          What use is this? If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s cancer cells have high expression for a particular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, and the correlation of that gene with drug activity is highly positive, then that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> may serve as a marker for tumor cells likely to be inhibited effectively by that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. If the correlation with drug activity is negative, then the marker gene may
          indicate when use of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is contraindicated.
          While important scientific questions about this approach remain open, its usefulness
          in generating hypotheses to be tested by further experiments is obvious. It is a very
          insightful way of organizing and extracting meaning from many individual observations.
          Without the microscope of mathematical methods and computational power, the insight given
          by the clustered image map could not be achieved.
        
      
      
        The Future
        To realize the possibilities of effective synergy between biology and mathematics will
        require both avoiding potential problems and seizing potential opportunities.
        
          Potential problems.
          The productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> of biology and mathematics will face problems that concern
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, intellectual property, and national security.
          Educating the next generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> will require early emphasis on
          quantitative skills in primary and secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and more opportunities for training
          in both biology and mathematics at undergraduate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX>, and postdoctoral levels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUBE</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>).
          Intellectual property rights may both stimulate and obstruct the potential synergy of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> and mathematics. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> is a potlatch culture. The bigger one's gift to the
          common pool of knowledge and techniques, the higher one's status, just as in the potlatch
          culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest</ENAMEX> coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. In the case of
          research in mathematics and biology, intellectual property rights to algorithms and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> need to balance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, and future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenberg 2003).</ENAMEX>
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> area of potential problems as well as opportunities is national security.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> and national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> can collaborate by supporting and doing open research
          on the optimal design of monitoring networks and mitigation strategies for all kinds of
          biological attacks (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wein et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). But openness of scientific methods or biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagents</ENAMEX> in microbiology may pose security risks in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. Problems of
          conserving privacy may arise when disparate databases are connected, such as physician
          payment databases with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> diagnosis databases, or health databases with law
          enforcement databases.
        
        
          Opportunities.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mathematical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can circumvent ethical dilemmas. For example, in a study of the
          household transmission of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Chagas disease</ENAMEX> in northwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen and Gürtler</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>)
          wanted to know—since <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are a reservoir of infection—what would happen if <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> were
          removed from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> areas, without spraying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insecticides</ENAMEX> against the
          insect that transmits infection. Because neither the householders nor the state public
          health apparatus can afford to spray the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in some areas, the realistic
          experiment would be to ask householders to remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> without spraying. But a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> who goes to a household and observes an insect infestation is morally obliged
          to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> and eliminate the infestation. In a detailed mathematical model, it was easy to
          set a variable representing the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> areas to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. All
          components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were based on measurements made in real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. The calculation
          showed that banishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> areas would substantially reduce the intensity of
          infection in the absence of spraying, though spraying would contribute to additional
          reductions in the intensity of infection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> was used to do an experiment
          conceptually that could not be done ethically in a real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. The conceptual
          experiment suggested the value of educating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> about the important health benefits
          of removing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> areas.
          The future of a scientific field is probably less predictable than the future in
          general. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doubtless</ENAMEX>, though, there will be exciting opportunities for the collaboration of
          mathematics and biology. Mathematics can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> grasp problems that are
          otherwise too big (the biosphere) or too small (molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>); too slow
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">macroevolution</NUMEX>) or too fast (photosynthesis); too remote in time (early extinctions) or
          too remote in space (life at extremes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and in space); too complex (the human
          brain) or too dangerous or unethical (epidemiology of infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>
          summarizes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> biological and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> mathematical challenges where interactions between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> and mathematics may prove particularly fruitful.
