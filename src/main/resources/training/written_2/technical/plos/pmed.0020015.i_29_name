        The protective effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides have been
        appreciated since the development of serum therapy, in which passively transferred,
        serotype-specific antipneumococcal serum reduced mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumococcal pneumonia</ENAMEX> by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. The development of pneumococcal polysaccharide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] and the
        efficacy of pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polysaccharide‚Äìprotein conjugate vaccines</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>] have confirmed that active immunity to the polysaccharide can provide excellent
        protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive disease</ENAMEX> from pneumococci of the same serotype, and in some
        cases protection against cross-reacting serotypes within the same serogroup.
        While the ability of passive or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine-induced anticapsular antibodies</ENAMEX> to protect
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumococcal disease</ENAMEX> is clear, less is known about the natural development of
        immunity to pneumococcal disease in unimmunized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. In unimmunized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, the
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive disease</ENAMEX> follows a well-known age distribution, peaking in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> of life, declining by more than an order of magnitude by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second and third decades</TIMEX> of
        life, and then rising at an accelerating pace, with incidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> y
        approaching that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. The reason for the decline in incidence has not been
        conclusively determined, yet it is often suggested that the acquisition of anticapsular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> plays a critical role in this decline [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7</NUMEX>]. Indeed, it has been proposed that
        the human immune system sees each serotype of 
        Streptococcus pneumoniae as a distinct, independent pathogen
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        The hypothesis that protection from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive pneumococcal disease</ENAMEX> is caused by the
        acquisition of anticapsular antibodies directed against each of the pneumococcal serotypes
        yields <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> simple predictions about the age-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epidemiology</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumococcal disease</ENAMEX>.
        First, it predicts that the age-specific timing of the decline in invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should
        be different for different serotypes: those that are rare, poorly immunogenic, or both
        should decline later in life than those that are common and immunogenic. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it
        predicts that protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive disease</ENAMEX> from a given serotype should coincide
        temporally with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticapsular antibody</ENAMEX> to that serotype, both at an
        individual level and at a population level. We tested these predictions using data from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> Dataset
          Incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive pneumococcal disease</ENAMEX> was measured in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> participating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX>'s Active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacterial Core Surveillance</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1994 and 1999</TIMEX>. The data used here are restricted to
          those periods during which serotyping was routinely performed: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1994‚Äì1999</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>
          site, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1995‚Äì1999</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> site, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1998‚Äì1999</NUMEX> for all other sites [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were
          not available on the timing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticapsular antibody</ENAMEX> acquisition in these same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, but we compared the timing of the decline in pneumococcal disease against
          previously published data on age-specific prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticapsular antibody</ENAMEX> levels
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mcg</ENAMEX>/ml [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> Dataset
          Antibody concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>)
          (with absorption by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall polysaccharide</ENAMEX> but not by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22F</TIMEX> polysaccharide) in blood
          samples that were obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> toddlers at enrollment and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12 and 24</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mo</ENAMEX> after enrollment in a double-blind, controlled trial of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-valent pneumococcal
          conjugate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddlers</ENAMEX> analyzed for this study were those in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          which received meningococcal C conjugate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>; the details of the trial [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] were
          previously described. Preliminary analyses of these data confirmed previous findings [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]
          that ELISA measurements were highly correlated (and therefore likely revealed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactions) for all pairs of serotypes, except for type <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, for which correlations
          were minimal, consistent with previous findings of little cross-reaction. For this
          reason, we chose to analyze age trends only in serotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> Dataset
          Mandatory reporting from all microbiological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> to the National
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register of Infectious Disease</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www3.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ktl</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fi/stat/</ENAMEX>) identified all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and
          cerebrospinal fluid isolates of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae obtained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years 1995‚Äì2001</TIMEX>. Incidence
          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-mo</NUMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> denominators obtained from
          Statistics <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Helsinki</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>). Since the primary purpose of examining incidence
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> was to compare age-specific rates against published distributions of antibody
          concentrations for the same age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], we restricted our attention to serotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          and serogroup <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, for which subsequent investigations suggested antibody measurements in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> were relatively unaffected by cross-reactions [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> measurements for
          published data from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> used a special type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">6B polysaccharide</ENAMEX> that was found to
          minimize cross-reactions [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Findings</ENAMEX>
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> shows the age-specific incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive pneumococcal disease</ENAMEX>, by
          capsular serogroup, obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based active surveillance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> prior to the introduction of the conjugate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> shows age-specific
          incidence by type of infection, for the same age range.
          Incidence peaks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 9 and 15</TIMEX> mo, and falls in an approximately
          parallel fashion thereafter, for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> most important serogroups (which are
          those included in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-valent conjugate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>) and for the remaining serogroups
          put together. The same pattern is observed for both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and bacteremia. For each
          serogroup, incidence by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 24</TIMEX> mo is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> that in the peak age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> mo, incidence for each serogroup has fallen to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì25%</NUMEX> of its peak.
          The consistent timing of the pattern across multiple serogroups argues for a common
          mechanism, rather than for independent acquisition of immunity to each serogroup as a
          separate event. Since most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> do not suffer from invasive pneumococcal disease
          in this age range, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mucosal disease</ENAMEX> (otitis media) from pneumococci may be the
          immunizing event for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticapsular antibodies</ENAMEX> in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] (although in
          principle immunity to some serogroups could be generated in response to cross-reacting
          antigens from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]). Different serogroups have
          vastly different frequencies among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pneumococci</ENAMEX> isolated from carriage [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,15,16,17</NUMEX>] and
          otitis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,18</NUMEX>]; for example, serogroups <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 18</NUMEX> and the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">serogroups</ENAMEX> are
          isolated far less commonly than several of the other pneumococcal types identified in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. One could postulate that these differences in frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> are offset
          by differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">immunogenicity</TIMEX>; however, there is little evidence that serotypes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or
          18C are more immunogenic than other, far more common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serotypes</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,15</NUMEX>]. One could also
          postulate that the frequency of isolation of serotypes from carriage depends on duration
          as well as incidence, so that the serotypes for which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> appears rare are simply
          carried for a shorter duration. While the data to address this speculation are limited,
          the duration of carriage of types <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 and 18C</TIMEX> seems to be comparable to that of other, more
          frequently carried serotypes [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,16</NUMEX>]. Thus, the most parsimonious interpretation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the timing of the decline in age-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">susceptibility</ENAMEX> is that one or more
          common mechanisms are responsible for the decline in disease from all serotypes.
          Testing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> prediction against data is hampered by the fact that, to our
          knowledge, no study has characterized the age-specific distribution of antibody
          concentration in a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> using the currently accepted methodology, which
          includes absorption with both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall polysaccharide</ENAMEX> and serotype <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">22F</ENAMEX> polysaccharide
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,19</NUMEX>]. Analyses by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soininen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have found that antibodies measured by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard ELISA</ENAMEX> in unimmunized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are highly cross-reactive between different
          serotypes, and that cross-reactive antibodies lack opsonophagocytic function and often
          appear in the absence of any documented exposure to a given capsular serotype. As a
          result, age-specific antibody concentration data for any given serotype are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúcontaminated</ENAMEX>,‚Äù to a greater or lesser degree, by cross-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificties</ENAMEX>.
          The most important exception to this problem occurs for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to serotype <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, for
          which cross-reaction is minimal [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. A recent publication describes the age-specific
          proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> with anti-type-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> polysaccharide antibody
          concentration exceeding the putative protective concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 Œ</NUMEX>ºg/ml (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of
          [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> mo, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì95%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> falls below this level, and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> mo, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì85%</NUMEX>
          remains below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">it‚Äîdespite</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%‚Äì50%</NUMEX> drop in disease incidence from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 mo to 24 mo.</NUMEX> At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> remain below the putative protective level, although by this age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX> has fallen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80%</NUMEX> from its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-mo</NUMEX> peak. In summary, if the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-Œ<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ºg/ml</ENAMEX>
          concentration were truly the threshold for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúprotection,‚Äù the 20</ENAMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì30%</NUMEX> reduction in the
          unprotected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between ages 12 and 36</TIMEX> mo would be inadequate to explain the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>
          decline in disease incidence. Clearly, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 Œ</NUMEX>ºg/ml is not a precise dividing line between
          being <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúprotected‚Äù and ‚Äúunprotected,‚Äù a</ENAMEX> threshold that (if it exists) may vary by
          serotype, but given the available data, there is reason to doubt that anti-type-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          antibody alone is responsible for the decline in disease in this age range.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel Findings</ENAMEX>
          To assess whether the limitations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> antibody described above‚Äîi.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>,
          the availability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> cutoff point for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody concentrations‚</ENAMEX>Äîmight be providing
          an incomplete picture of the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> levels by age, we examined an
          additional dataset from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddlers</ENAMEX>. For the reasons described above, we examined
          only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to serotype <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>, for which the distribution of concentrations by age is
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. These data indicate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 12‚Äì17 and 36‚Äì41</TIMEX> mo, the
          median antibody concentration increases by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX>-fold. These data are broadly
          consistent with those published for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> levels rise very
          gradually, though detectably, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second and third years</TIMEX> of life. It is difficult
          to believe‚Äîalbeit not impossible‚Äîthat the dramatic declines in disease incidence over
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these years</TIMEX> are explained simply by this small rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> concentrations.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finland Findings</ENAMEX>
          Incidence of serogroup <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and serotype 14</NUMEX> invasive pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mo age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>, shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, is broadly similar to that found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, albeit with lower absolute incidence for both serogroups. Peak incidence occurs
          in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12‚Äì17</NUMEX>-mo age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and incidence declines to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì30%</NUMEX> of its peak rate by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24‚Äì29</NUMEX> mo
          of age. This decline in incidence may be compared against the cumulative distributions of
          antibody concentrations in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> toddlers shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between ages 12</TIMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> mo, there is a discernible increase in the concentration of antibodies in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, but the median concentration increases by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 2</NUMEX>-fold in this period.
          Moreover, the proportion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> concentration below any
          particular threshold that may indicate protection changes little in this period. For
          example, the proportion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with anti-type-14 antibody concentrations less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> Œºg/ml declines from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 55%</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40%</NUMEX>, and the proportion
          with less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Œºg/ml is reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95%</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80%</NUMEX>. Similar patterns are
          seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> data for type 6B [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Thus, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> data, only a
          very small shift in the distribution of type-specific anti-polysaccharide antibody
          concentration is observed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</TIMEX> of life, yet incidence of invasive
          disease from the serotypes in question declines substantially.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have assessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lines of epidemiological evidence, analyzed ecologically, that bear
        on the role of anticapsular polysaccharide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> as the determinant of protection
        against invasive disease that develops during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second and third year</TIMEX> of life. The
        simultaneous and approximately parallel nature of the decline in disease incidence for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> most important serogroups in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> suggests that one mechanism, rather
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> independent mechanisms, account for the declines in invasive disease from these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serogroups</ENAMEX>. Moreover, only a slight increase in anticapsular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> concentration is
        measurable in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> toddlers during the same age range. As we
        discuss below, each of these lines of evidence is subject to caveats, but we believe that,
        taken together, these observations make a strong case for the importance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
        factors other than acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticapsular antibodies</ENAMEX> in the development of protection
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumococcal disease</ENAMEX>.
        There are several possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for mechanisms that could explain this age-related
        decline in pneumococcal disease. These include the following: acquisition of antibodies or
        cellular immune responses to noncapsular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pneumococcal ‚Äúspecies‚Äù antigens</ENAMEX>; age-related
        changes in host biology that are not related to acquired immunity, such as maturation of
        the innate immune system or changes in anatomy or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for pneumococcal attachment;
        changes in other risk factors, such as exposure; or changes related to other
        microorganisms, including changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">resident flora</ENAMEX> or changes in the incidence of
        viral infections.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Systemic antibodies</ENAMEX> to several pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein antigens</ENAMEX>, which are conserved across
        pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> and serotypes, develop following pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> and otitis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> and are present by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the second year</TIMEX> of life [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,21</NUMEX>]. In both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], there is an increase in the concentration of antibodies to the
        pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins pneumolysin</ENAMEX> and pneumococcal surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A over the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
        more years of life. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to another conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, pneumococcal surface
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adhesin A</ENAMEX>, showed similar distributions in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of life,
        while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX>, levels of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were already high (equivalent to adult levels)
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of life, and increased above these levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
        either passively transferred human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> against pneumococcal surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine-induced antibodies</ENAMEX> to pneumococcal surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> A and/or pneumolysin are
        protective against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasive disease</ENAMEX>. Such data are consistent with the hypothesis that
        antibodies to these, or perhaps other, conserved pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are in part
        responsible for the decline in invasive disease in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second and subsequent years</TIMEX> of
        life.
        A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have tested the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to the pneumococcal
        teichoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell wall polysaccharide</ENAMEX> (CWPS), are capable of protecting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumococcal invasive disease</ENAMEX>. While studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] have failed to find a protective effect of antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWPS</ENAMEX> or its components, a
        recent study showed that passive transfer of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG</ENAMEX> against phosphorylcholine, a
        component of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWPS</ENAMEX>, could protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> against invasive pneumococcal infections [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        Notably, such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> might be elicited by a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in addition to
        pneumococci, such as 
        Haemophilus influenzae, which also produce phosphorylcholine. We are
        unaware of studies on the timing of acquisition of anti-CWPS <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
        We have recently shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that are exposed thrice at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> intervals to
        intranasal colonization with encapsulated pneumococci are protected against subsequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">carriage</ENAMEX>, that this protection is effective for heterologous as well as homologous capsular
        types, and that it is effective even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MuMT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, which lack the ability to produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malley R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trzcinski K, Srivastava A</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson CM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson PW</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished data). We have also shown that intranasal immunization with unencapsulated,
        killed pneumococci protects against nasopharyngeal colonization, in a fashion that is
        independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> but requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells at the time of challenge. The relevance
        of cellular immune mechanisms in protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> against pneumococcal colonization or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is not known.
        Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for a factor that may be changing with age is susceptibility to viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX>, which may predispose to pneumococcal colonization [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] or
        disease [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,27</NUMEX>]. Recent evidence from clinical trials of pneumococcal conjugate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>
        shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> can reduce the incidence of infections such as bronchiolitis that
        are usually associated with viruses [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>] and of documented, virus-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. These findings raise the possibility that the decline in pneumococcal disease with
        age reflects, in part, a decline in the incidence or severity of viral infections, so that
        fewer such infections lead to secondary pneumococcal disease.
        Exposure to pneumococci probably changes in some fashion over the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 y</NUMEX> of life.
        However, for changes in exposure to account for the sharp drop in disease incidence
        following the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> birthday, it would be necessary for exposure also to drop severalfold
        per year over this age range. Studies of pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> do show gradual changes in
        the prevalence and serotype composition of the nasopharyngeal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these years</TIMEX>, but the
        prevalence of carriage changes much more gradually than the incidence of invasive disease
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        We are not aware of data that bear strongly on the plausibility of other possible
        mechanisms for the age-related decline in pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, such as changes in anatomy,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiology</ENAMEX>, receptor expression, or resident bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>. However, factors other than
        antibody‚Äîsuch as innate or acquired cellular immune responses, age-related anatomical
        changes, or changes in exposure to pneumococci‚Äîcannot be ruled out, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
        factor may be involved. Indeed, the peak of pneumococcal meningitis incidence in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3‚Äì6</NUMEX>-mo
        age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) suggests that the mechanism of protection against meningitis may
        differ from those against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> and bacteremia.
        Although we suggest that anticapsular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> is not primarily responsible for the
        age-specific decline in invasive pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, there is no question that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capsule</ENAMEX> is an important virulence factor that interacts with the innate and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired immune</ENAMEX>
        system in a number of ways. It is clear that the pneumococcal capsule interferes with
        various host clearance mechanisms [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. It would be unsurprising if different capsular
        types were differentially effective in permitting pneumococci to evade phagocytosis and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> defenses [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Melin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Jarva</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Meri</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. K√§yhty</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). If
        this were the case, then one could envision that certain capsular types might in fact
        follow a different age-specific incidence. In particular, recent analyses suggest that
        serotypes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 5</NUMEX> have relatively stable incidence over a range of age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">W. P.</ENAMEX>
        Hausdorff, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. R. Feikin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. P. Klugman</ENAMEX>, unpublished data).
        The evidence adduced here is subject to several limitations. With respect to the
        relative timing of acquisition of protection against different serotypes, one could
        postulate that because some of the most common pneumococcal serotypes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6B</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19F</TIMEX>, and
        23F, are also among the least immunogenic [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], the effective exposure of the immune system
        is more consistent across serogroups than it appears from serogroup frequency alone.
        However, this pattern is not general; for example, serotype <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> is both very common and
        highly immunogenic [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. With respect to the absolute timing of protection relative to the
        acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, one could argue that low levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticapsular antibody</ENAMEX>, perhaps
        of low affinity, may be present and even active at levels below those that can be reliably
        detected by current assays, or that B cell memory may be present and protective at an
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier age</TIMEX> than that at which high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> are measurable. Inferences about
        protective antibody concentrations from animal studies and from concentrations achieved by
        vaccines suffer from several uncertainties. Making allowances for all of these limitations,
        we nonetheless believe the data suggest that mechanisms other than anticapsular antibody
        are primarily responsible for the age-specific decline in pneumococcal invasive disease
        that starts at the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 y.</ENAMEX>
        The likelihood that mechanisms other than anticapsular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> confer immunity to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumococcal disease</ENAMEX> has important implications with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> design. As
        experience with conjugate pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> unfolds, it is becoming
        increasingly clear that such a strategy suffers from several limitations, including the
        possibility of serotype replacement (already confirmed in several clinical trials), a
        modest effect on nasopharyngeal colonization, limited serotype coverage, cost, and
        difficulties in production that have led to shortages since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">licensure</TIMEX>. A better
        understanding of the mechanisms that underlie natural immunity to pneumococcus could pave
        the way for the development of more effective, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>-specific pneumococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>.
