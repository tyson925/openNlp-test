        burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. In their quest to understand <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia epidemiology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John McGrath</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have previously undertaken a systematic review of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>
        incidence‚Äîthat is, the number of new cases diagnosed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in a specified population
        (see 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMC Medicine</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2: e13</TIMEX>). They now report results from a second systematic
        review that examines published studies on the prevalence of the disease‚Äîi.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>, on the number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are suffering from the disease at a given time or within a specified time
        interval. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incidence</ENAMEX> studies can suggest risk factors that may underlie variations in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Prevalence studies are central to health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> planning.)
        Analyzing a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,721</NUMEX> estimates from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> studies and covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, they
        calculated the following median prevalence estimates: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.6</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> for point prevalence
        (defined as prevalence during any interval of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a month</TIMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX> for period prevalence
        (defined as prevalence during a period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 12 months</TIMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> for lifetime prevalence
        (the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> who have ever manifested the disease and
        who are alive on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given day</TIMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.2</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> morbid risk (which attempts to include
        the entire lifetime of a birth cohort, both past and future, and includes those deceased at
        the time of the survey).
        These numbers are consistent with key policy documents about point prevalence, but
        suggest that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì1%</NUMEX> estimate for lifetime prevalence given in many textbooks is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimate</ENAMEX>. This estimate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest, ‚Äúis another example where the research
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> needs to review their belief systems in the face of data.‚Äù Another often quoted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX>, namely that ‚Äúschizophrenia affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> in a hundred‚Äù most sensibly refers
        to lifetime morbid risk data. Here as well, the systematic analysis suggests that the
        reality is somewhat lower, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest that ‚Äúif we wish to provide the general
        public with a measure of the likelihood that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> during
        their lifetime, then a more accurate statement would be that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about seven to eight</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> will be affected.‚Äù
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> were surprised to find no difference in prevalence between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">females</ENAMEX>, because their incidence review had found a male/female risk ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>. On the
        other hand, the incidence study had revealed a higher incidence among migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> than
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and this was true for prevalence estimates as well. Compared
        to economically developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is lower in developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX>, which is consistent with the literature showing that the course (i.e., prognosis)
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> is better in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Systematic</ENAMEX> reviews are secondary research, where the object of scrutiny is not the
        prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> per se but the literature on the topic, and the estimates in
        this review have to be treated accordingly. Regardless of exact numbers, however, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> conclude that ‚Äúmany <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> have persisting symptoms, despite the
        best mix of interventions we can offer.‚Äù It has been estimated that current interventions
        can at most reduce <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of disease burden, thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> conclude that ‚Äúthis is a
        powerful argument for investing in applied and basic research.‚Äù
