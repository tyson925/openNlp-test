        see between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are caused by changes that have occurred in the genes that regulate
        their developmental programs. Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, general principles began to emerge
        about the evolution of development in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The identification of the 
        Hox <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
        Drosophila melanogaster and the subsequent discovery of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX> and similar expression in different <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metazoans</ENAMEX> led to the revolutionary
        realization that many of the mechanisms critical to basic animal development have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> across <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 500 million years</TIMEX> of evolution. Many other developmental
        pathways, such as those specifying the heart and the central nervous system, have since
        been elucidated and promptly subjected to successful comparative analysis.
        These celebrated discoveries illustrate ways that very different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are, at a
        fundamental level, similar to one another. But not all developmental processes are so
        conservative; an outstanding example is sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>. The majority of animal species
        produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX>, and current phylogenies (e.g., [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]) suggest that sexual dimorphism was
        likely a feature of the last common ancestor of the coelomate bilaterians, a vast clade of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that excludes only sponges, ctenophores, cnidarians, and acoel flatworms. However,
        though critical for development and reproduction, the mechanisms that specify sex
        determination are among the least-conserved known. Marked variation exists in both the
        primary sex determination signal and in the downstream genetic pathways that interpret the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX>. We are thus presented with our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> conundrum: sexual differentiation appears to
        be an ancient, and potentially homologous, feature of animal biology, yet its genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specification</ENAMEX> suggests multiple origins.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bewildering Variety</ENAMEX>
        The variety of primary sex determination cues was appreciated long before the advent of
        molecular genetics [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broadest categories are genetic sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> (GSD), in
        which the sex of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> is set by a sex chromosome or an autosomal gene, and
        environmental sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> (ESD), in which sex is determined by temperature (as with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">turtles</ENAMEX>), local sex ratio (as with some tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>), or population density (as with
        mermithid nematodes). Though little is known about the molecular mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESD</ENAMEX>, within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSD</ENAMEX> systems many different mechanisms have been uncovered. Dual sex chromosome systems,
        in which either the female (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZW/ZZ</ENAMEX>) or the male (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX/XY</ENAMEX>) is heterogametic, are common, as are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> set by the ratio of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> chromosomes to sets of autosomes (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>:A). There
        are also systems in which heterozygosity at a single locus is required for female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> (known as complementary sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>; [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]), as well as systems involving
        sex determination via multiple genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> effects.
        Molecular genetic investigations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSD</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model systems</ENAMEX> such as 
        Drosophila , 
        Caenorhabditis , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have revealed a clear lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conservation</ENAMEX>, underscoring the diversity. For example, although the primary sex
        determination signal in both 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> melanogaster and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>:A ratio, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> consists of a
        cell-autonomous cascade of regulated mRNA splicing, while that of the nematode follows a 
        Hedgehog -like intercellular signaling pathway [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSD</ENAMEX> in
        mammals depends (with some interesting exceptionsâ€”see [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]) upon a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-specific dominant gene
        (
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sry</ENAMEX> ) encoding a transcription factor. In the face of such
        impressive differences, perhaps we should question our assumption of homology: could it be
        that sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> in different taxa has arisen independently over and over again in
        evolution? Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, this seemed like a good bet.
        The discovery of the homology of the key sex-determining genes 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">doublesex</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        mab-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans provided the first evidence for a common evolutionary
        basis of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Soon, related 
        doublesex-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mab</NUMEX>-3 (DM)-family genes with roles in male sexual development
        were discovered in vertebrates and even cnidarians [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>]. Here at last was a smoking gun
        that could link the diverse metazoan sex determination systems (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). But as
        satisfying as the result was, it immediately gave birth to another mystery: if the enormous
        diversity of sex determination systems are all derived from a common ancestor, how could
        they possibly have been modified so radically? After all, sexual differentiation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> are hardly unimportant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developmental</ENAMEX> processes!
      
      
        Focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Close Relatives</ENAMEX>
        To understand how such diversity came to be, we need to look at the differences between
        closely related species. This approach allows the discovery and interpretation of
        small-scale sex determination changes before they are obscured by subsequent changes. The
        processes discovered in this way might then be reasonably extrapolated to explain the
        seemingly unrelated systems of more deeply diverged taxa. Work in dipterans [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nematodes</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] has revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> evolutionary phenomena that characterize shorter-term sex
        determination evolution.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these is the often astounding rate of molecular evolution at the level of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotide</ENAMEX> and aminoacid sequences. Although some sex-determining genes are well conserved,
        many show unprecedented substitution rates [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. An extreme example is the central
        integrator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>:A ratio in 
        Caenorhabditis , 
        xol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> . The 
        xol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> orthologues of the closely related nematodes 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> briggsae are a mere <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> identical [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], even though genes
        surrounding 
        xol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> are much better conserved (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX>€² neighbor
        of 
        xol-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , the immunoglobulin 
        dim-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 5 kb</NUMEX> away and is essentially identical between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phenomenon, best exemplified by dipteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, is the modification of
        genetic control pathways through the gain or loss of key pathway components (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>). In
        
        Drosophila , the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> gene to respond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>:A ratio is 
        Sxl , whose transcription is regulated by both autosomal and X-linked
        factors very early in development [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,13</NUMEX>]. When <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>: A = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (i.e., in female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">embryos</ENAMEX>), 
        Sxl transcription occurs and produces <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sxl protein</ENAMEX>. Later in development,
        transcription from a second promoter occurs in both sexes, but these transcripts cannot be
        productively spliced without the earlier burst of 
        Sxl expression. As a result, only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> sustain 
        Sxl expression, and in turn only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> can productively splice the mRNA
        of 
        tra , its downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. Productive splicing of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tra</ENAMEX> is required to produce the female-specific form of 
        dsx , a founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> mentioned above.
        In a series of groundbreaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saccone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> investigated the pathway in
        the more distantly related heterogametic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> fruit fly 
        Ceratitis capitata . The first surprise was that although a
        highly conserved 
        Sxl homologue exists in 
        Ceratitis , it does not undergo sex-specific regulation similar
        to that of 
        Drosophila , which suggests that it does not play a key switch
        role (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saccone et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). Similar results have also been found for the housefly, 
        Musca domestica [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], indicating that the role of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sxl</ENAMEX> in sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> may be restricted to 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and its closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. In contrast, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tra</ENAMEX> and 
        dsx are key sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> in all dipterans examined thus far.
        A further surprise came when the 
        Ceratitis tra homologue was characterized [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In the case of
        this gene, clear evidence for sex-specific regulation was found, and as with 
        Drosophila , only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> productively splice 
        tra mRNA. However, this splicing difference can be explained nicely by a
        positive feedback, similar to that seen in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drosophila Sxl</ENAMEX> , in which Tra <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> regulates its own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splicing</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pane et al.</ENAMEX> proposed that the dominant, male-specifying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> factor on the
        Y chromosome inhibits this autoregulation [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> cannot make functional
        Tra <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and the male form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dsx</ENAMEX> is produced. These experiments show not only how a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> can evolve, but also, importantly, how <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>:A and heterogametic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSD</ENAMEX> systems can be
        interconverted by modifying the cue that regulates a conserved molecular switch gene (the
        splicing of 
        tra mRNA). A detailed scenario for how this might occur has recently been
        proposed [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        Finally, recent studies of 
        Caenorhabditis nematodes have shed light on the genetic basis of
        the convergent evolution of sex determination related to mating system adaptations. An
        important factor in this area are new phylogenies of the genus [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,18</NUMEX>], which consistently
        suggest the surprising possibility that the closely related hermaphroditic species 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> briggsae acquired self-fertilization independently, from
        distinct gonochoristic (male<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">/female</ENAMEX>) ancestors (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). Although this scenario is
        somewhat uncertain purely on parsimony grounds, recent work on the genetic control of the
        germline bisexuality that defines hermaphroditism has tipped the balance toward parallel
        evolution.
        Working with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clifford et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] cloned 
        fog-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , a gene required for spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites but not in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>. Upon doing so, it became clear that 
        fog-2 is part of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box genes and was produced by
        several recent rounds of gene duplication. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> briggsae genome sequence suggested that while 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. briggsae</ENAMEX> possesses a similarly large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>box
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, the duplication event giving rise to 
        fog-2 was specific to the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">elegans</ENAMEX> lineage. In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology , Nayak et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] extend this work by rigorously
        demonstrating that 
        fog-2 is indeed absent in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> briggsae . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> also identify a short, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        domain that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FOG-2</ENAMEX> uniquely able to perform its germline sex-determining function.
        This domain is probably derived from a frame-shifting mutation in an ancestral gene.
        Working with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> briggsae , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stothard et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haag et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (unpublished data) have also found evidence of important species-specific regulation
        of germline sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference and gene knockout approaches have shown
        that while 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> requires the male-promoting genes 
        fem-2 and 
        fem-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sperm</ENAMEX> in hermaphrodites, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">briggsae</ENAMEX> requires neither. Given that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have
        conserved roles in male somatic sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>, this suggests that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> briggsae evolved hermaphroditism in a way that bypasses these
        genes.
        The long-standing mystery of sex determination and its diversity began by comparisons
        between distantly related species. Recent work on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">closer relatives</ENAMEX> has uncovered processes
        that through a reasonable extrapolation enable the connection of these disparate dots into
        a fascinating picture of developmental evolution. Though the divergence is extreme, it is
        likely that a better understanding of the evolution of sex determination genes and pathways
        holds lessons about the evolution of development in general. The next major challenge will
        be to integrate the comparative developmental data with the ecological and population
        processes that are driving the evolution of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX>. Only then will we be able to
        say that the picture is complete.
