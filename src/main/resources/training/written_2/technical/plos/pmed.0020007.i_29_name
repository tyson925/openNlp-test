        as a way of reducing their risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the recommendation is often followed
        by the acknowledgment that evidence of benefit is still lacking, but “it can't hurt.” What
        could possibly be the problem with older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> spending their time doing crossword puzzles
        and anagrams, completing figural logic puzzles, or testing their reaction time on a
        computer? In certain respects, there is no problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> will probably improve at the
        targeted skills, and may feel good—particularly if the activity is both challenging and
        successfully completed.
        But can it hurt? Possibly. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways that encouraging mental activity programs
        might do more harm than good. First, they may offer false hope. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who do
        develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX> might be blamed for their condition. When heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX>,
        they are sometimes seen as having contributed to their own fates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> might similarly be viewed as having brought it on themselves through failure to
        exercise their brains.
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does the Evidence Show</ENAMEX>?
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> types of evidence are cited to support the idea that mental exercise can improve
        one's chances of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">escaping Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX>.
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies
          Having <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX> of education has been shown to be related to a lower prevalence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> in cross-sectional, population-based studies [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] and to a lower
          incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> followed longitudinally [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Typically, the
          risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to four</NUMEX> times higher in those who have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fewer years</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, as compared to those who have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX> of education. Other epidemiological
          studies, albeit with less consistency, have suggested that those who engage in more
          leisure activities, especially activities that are mentally stimulating, have a lower
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevalence</ENAMEX> and incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>]. Additionally, longitudinal studies
          have found that older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> without dementia who participate in more intellectually
          challenging daily activities show less decline over time on various tests of cognitive
          performance [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>].
          In epidemiological studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> cannot be randomly assigned to different levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, or to different kinds and levels of participation in leisure activities.
          Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> must try to identify confounders and take them into account
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytically</ENAMEX>. However, uncertainties remain. Both education and leisure activities are
          imperfect measures of mental exercise. For instance, leisure activities represent a
          combination of influences. Not only is there mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">activation</ENAMEX>, but there may also be
          broader health effects, including stress reduction and improved vascular health—both of
          which may contribute to reducing dementia risk [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. It could also be that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> factor,
          such as intelligence, leads to greater levels of education (and more engagement in
          cognitively stimulating activities), and independently, to lower risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>.
          Research in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, for example, showed that IQ test scores at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 11</TIMEX> were predictive
          of future dementia risk [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          Another problem with these epidemiological studies is that reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">causation</ENAMEX> could be
          involved—in other words, that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">incipient</ENAMEX> dementia could be causing reduced engagement in
          leisure activities, although some prospective studies have been particularly attentive to
          controlling for this possibility [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Clinical trials are needed to test the hypotheses
          that emerge from the best epidemiological research. Moreover, because the onset of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> can be hard to pinpoint, and early changes may occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is diagnosed, conclusions must be based on large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, followed over a long
          period of time.
        
        
          Randomized clinical trials
          Many studies support the possibility of enhancing memory and other cognitive
          performance, or of slowing cognitive decline in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> without dementia [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. The
          most effective programs teach mnemonic strategies, provide practice, and give supportive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX>. Mnemonic strategies include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of items into meaningful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
          the use of imagery, and the method of loci (visualizing items to be remembered in a
          sequence of specific, well-learned locations). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive</ENAMEX> programs can also include:
          encouraging memory aids (such as appointment books), teaching relaxation techniques, and
          providing instruction about memory changes in normal aging. However, improvements are not
          found in all studies. When improvements are found, they are often modest, may not be
          maintained over time, and do not generalize beyond the skill being trained. Often, the
          subjective gains rival the objective ones; for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> do tend to report
          fewer complaints about their memory.
          These limitations are evident in one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">randomized</ENAMEX> controlled trials of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cognitive</ENAMEX> training with older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, a large, multisite study named ACTIVE (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cognitive Training</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent and Vital Elderly</ENAMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were assigned to
          receive training in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> cognitive skills: memory, reasoning, or speed of
          processing. Tests of cognitive abilities given immediately after training showed large
          improvements on the particular cognitive skill on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> had been trained,
          but no transfer to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> cognitive domains. Additionally, for the control group
          that received no training, simply taking the test battery at pre-test led to improvement
          on the post-test. The effects of training were maintained over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-year</TIMEX> follow-up.
          However, the cognitive training program had no significant effect on measures of everyday
          functioning. Finally, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in ACTIVE or in other memory training programs, it
          remains unknown whether eventual rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> will be reduced.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurobiology</ENAMEX> studies
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> type of evidence suggesting that mental exercise may help to prevent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> comes from neurobiology studies that show greater brain complexity in
          those with higher levels of mental activity. Many such studies, done with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, show
          greater neural complexity after having been exposed to an enriched environment that
          provides lots of stimulation, for example by including wheels, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>, toys, and gnawing
          sticks [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> human study with magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed changes in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hippocampus</ENAMEX> in elderly memory training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> compared to controls [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. Another
          report found changes on positron emission tomography scanning following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> memory program that included memory training, special diet, physical
          exercise, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> reduction [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mental Exercise</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognitive Reserve</ENAMEX>
        The concept of cognitive reserve is often used to explain why education and mental
        stimulation are beneficial. The term cognitive reserve is sometimes taken to refer directly
        to brain size or to synaptic density in the cortex. At other times, cognitive reserve is
        defined as the ability to compensate for acquired brain pathology. This definition
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encompasses</ENAMEX> coping skills as well as recruitment of other brain areas, with cognitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reserve</ENAMEX> thus accounting for individual differences in severity of cognitive dysfunction
        when there are pathological neural changes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> with a higher level of education have
        greater cognitive reserve. In some studies, education or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX> are even used as proxy
        measures of cognitive reserve, while others are beginning to measure neural substrates that
        correspond to reserve [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        Taken together, the evidence is very suggestive that having greater cognitive reserve is
        related to a reduced risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX>. But the evidence that mental exercise per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se</ENAMEX> can increase cognitive reserve and stave off dementia is weaker. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies
        suggest that individual differences in cognitive reserve may actually be lifelong. In
        addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with greater cognitive reserve may choose mentally stimulating leisure
        activities and jobs, leading to a chicken-and-egg dilemma for the interpretation of the
        relationship between mentally stimulating activities in adulthood and dementia risk.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognitive</ENAMEX> training has demonstrable effects on performance, on views of self, and on brain
        function—but the results are very specific to the skills that are trained, and it is as yet
        entirely unknown whether there is any effect on when or whether an individual develops
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX>. Further, the types of skills taught by practicing mental puzzles may be
        less helpful in everyday life than more prosaic “tricks,” such as concentrating, or taking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">notes</ENAMEX>, or putting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in the same place each time so that they won't be lost.
      
      
        Conclusion
        So far, we have little evidence that mental practice will help prevent the development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>. We have better evidence that good brain health is multiply determined, that
        brain development early in life matters, and that genetic influences are of great
        importance in accounting for individual differences in cognitive reserve and in explaining
        who develops <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> and who does not. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least half</NUMEX> of the explanation for
        individual differences in susceptibility to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> is genetic, although the
        genes involved have not yet been completely discovered [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The balance of the explanation
        lies in environmental influences and behavioral health practices, alone or in interaction
        with genetic factors.
        For older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, health practices that could influence the brain include sound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX>, sufficient sleep, stress management, treatment of mood or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety disorders</ENAMEX>,
        good vascular health, physical exercise, and avoidance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> trauma. But there is no
        convincing evidence that memory practice and other cognitively stimulating activities are
        sufficient to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX>; it is not just a case of “use it or lose it.”
