        information.‚Äù This is the verdict of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markus Ruschhaupt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> who, in a paper in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Applications</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Biology</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:</TIMEX> article
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>), discuss a paradigm for the presentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> data‚Äîin this case, from microarray
        analyses. The title of the article, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúA Compendium to Ensure Reproducibility in</ENAMEX>
        High-Dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Classification Tasks,‚Äù</ENAMEX> may not lend itself easily to a clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>,
        but the underlying message to clinicians could not be more important: that, currently,
        studies involving large datasets, especially ones that have a clinical outcome, are so
        poorly reported (or possibly so poorly done) that many are not reproducible. This problem
        was also the topic of a recent meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heidelberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúBest Practice in Microarray Studies‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biometrie</ENAMEX>.uni-heidelberg.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">de/workshops/bestpractice/</ENAMEX>index.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX>).
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarrays</ENAMEX> have become mainstream research tools in biology and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, the large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">datasets</ENAMEX> and complex analyses from these studies have presented challenges: for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> in
        analyzing the data, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> in deciding on the suitability of papers for
        publication, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> in determining how much data needs to be presented within the
        paper itself, for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in reproducing the data, and, finally, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> in
        deciding how to assess the data presented. The results from several high-profile papers
        have already proved difficult to reproduce, even by those with sufficient time and
        computing expertise.
        Where do such analyses leave the new science of molecular pathology? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruschhaupt</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> comment that ‚Äúthe literature on the induction of prognostic profiles from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> studies is a methodological wasteland.‚Äù Much the same could be said of other
        applications of molecular biology to clinical samples. A systematic review of molecular and
        biological tumor markers in neuroblastoma (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clin Cancer Res</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4‚Äì12</ENAMEX>) found that its
        conclusions were limited by ‚Äúsmall sample sizes, poor statistical reporting, large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> across studies‚Ä¶and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> bias.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù John Ioannidis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lancet</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">362: 1439‚Äì1444</ENAMEX>) did a similar analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> microarray studies with major clinical
        outcomes in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. They showed that the studies were small‚Äîmedian sample size was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and validation was incomplete in most studies. They recommended that molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prognostic</ENAMEX> studies be classified as phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (early exploratory probing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>), phase
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (exploratory with extensive analyses), or phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> (large confirmatory studies with
        pre-stated hypotheses and precise quantification of the magnitude of the effect), and that
        only studies that had undergone phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> testing should be considered robust enough for use
        in clinical practice. Most current studies should be considered as phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or, at best,
        phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        So, despite considerable hype, the published studies are far from the level of evidence
        that would be accepted for virtually any other medical test. In a review in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hematology</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am Soc Hematol Educ Program</ENAMEX>] <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">279‚Äì293</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita Braziel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        concluded, ‚Äúrapid identification and neutralization of spurious results is essential to
        prevent them from becoming accepted facts.‚Äù
        But these problems are not new in medical research. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">BMJ 308</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">283‚Äì284</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman</ENAMEX>, who was instrumental in developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONSORT</ENAMEX> guidelines for reporting of clinical
        trials, said that ‚Äúhuge sums of money are spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> on research that is seriously
        flawed through the use of inappropriate designs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unrepresentative samples</ENAMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>,
        incorrect methods of analysis, and faulty interpretation,‚Äù and ‚Äúthat quality control needs
        to be built in from the start rather than the failures being discarded.‚Äù
        So how can we ensure that the wealth of data pouring out of microarray and other
        molecular diagnostic studies is turned into meaningful knowledge? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microarray Gene</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Expression Data Society</ENAMEX> has proposed a set of guidelines (MIAME) for the reporting of
        microarray data, and that all such data should be deposited in public databases. But as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruschhaupt</ENAMEX> and others have shown, disclosure of results and data is not enough, since there
        is little consensus on the appropriate statistical analyses and many are developed on a
        case by case basis, which may not be reproducible, even by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
        advocate the use of standard statistical packages, which allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to repeat an
        entire analysis quickly and, hence, assess the robustness of the results. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have
        produced a transcript of their statistical analyses as a supplement to their articles
        (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nucleic Acids Res</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">32: e50</TIMEX>). At the very least <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> should have a protocol with a
        prespecified plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> selection and statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">analysis‚</ENAMEX>Äîaccepted practice for
        clinical trials, but not yet for other medical research. An ultimate aim for reporting
        would be the type of compendium discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruschhaupt</ENAMEX> and colleagues‚Äî‚Äúan interactive
        document that bundles primary data, statistical processing methods, figures, and derived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> together with the textual documentation and conclusions.‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> such compendium is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in a paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gentleman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol 4</ENAMEX>: article <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> is keen to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> towards making such reporting
        possible. But although the time might have gone when the two-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> article
        could suffice for complex papers, clinicians should nonetheless apply the same critical
        assessment that they would for any other clinical tool. If a result is too good to be true,
        it probably is.
