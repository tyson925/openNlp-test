        disorder that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whilst</ENAMEX> responding to symptomatic therapy, chronically disables its sufferers
        and adds an enormous economic burden in an aging society. We have some clues to the process
        underlying the disease from the snapshot provided by postmortem studies of diseased brains.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> of neurons in specific brain regions are lost, notably those that produce dopamine
        in a part of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. Those neurons that do survive to the
        end of the disease course contain accumulations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and lipids within their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX>. Named after their discoverer, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúLewy bodies‚Äù</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece of evidence that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein aggregation</ENAMEX> is related to the ongoing disease process.
        In contrast, the causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> are poorly defined except in those rare variant forms that
        are clearly genetic. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have been described where PD-like syndromes are
        inherited in either a dominant or recessive fashion, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the underlying genes have
        been identified. The precise relationships between these different syndromes are complex
        and are the subject of some controversy. For example, it is not clear whether all the
        genetic diseases given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PARK</ENAMEX> nomenclature have Lewy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and should be considered ‚Äútrue‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD‚</ENAMEX>Äîthe term parkinsonism is preferred for these syndromes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hardy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langston 2004).</ENAMEX> For
        the purposes of this primer, I will concentrate on the molecular biology of the genes
        linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> rather than disease etiology. However, my assumption is that symptoms of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> are a reflection of neuronal dysfunction, and that in the disease state the balance
        between damage and survival tips in the direction of cell loss. Whilst dominant mutations
        overwhelm the ability of cells to survive, recessive mutations result in the absence of
        protective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and make the neuron grow weaker.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aggregation of Œ±-Synuclein</ENAMEX> in Neurodegeneration
        On the detrimental side of the cell survival equation is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> gene that was discovered
        first, Œ±
        -synuclein . The synaptic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> encoded by this gene, Œ±-synuclein, is
        prone to aggregation, and, as is the case for other aggregating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, mutations in Œ±-
        synuclein are associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dominantly</ENAMEX> inherited disease. Related to
        this, Œ±-synuclein is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> component of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. The phenotype of patients
        with Œ±-
        synuclein mutations varies from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> to a more diffuse Lewy body disease in
        which pathology is detected in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. Mutations
        in Œ±-
        synuclein include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> point mutations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A30P</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E46K</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A53T</ENAMEX>) and
        multiplication of the wild-type (normal) gene. All of these mutations increase the tendency
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ±-synuclein</NUMEX> to aggregate, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is a consequence of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX>. An interesting example is the triplication of the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>: toxicity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX> can both be driven by increased expression and are thus qualitative, not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantitative</ENAMEX>, effects (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singleton et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). The fact that the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aggregate</ENAMEX> suggests that the process is fundamentally similar for both inherited and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sporadic PD</ENAMEX> in which wild-type Œ±-synuclein is also present in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lewy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. Several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> have suggested that non-genetic risk factors may also promote damage via their
        effects on (wild-type) Œ±-synuclein conformation or aggregation (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Di Monte 2003</ENAMEX>). This
        reinforces the notion that Œ±-synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of both sporadic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">familial PD</ENAMEX>.
        There is some controversy about the exact nature of the toxic species produced by
        Œ±-synuclein, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point mutation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A30P</NUMEX>) behaves differently from the others. Instead of
        forming fibrils, which are insoluble, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">high-molecular-weight species</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A30P</NUMEX> forms relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soluble</ENAMEX>, partially aggregated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conway et al. 2000).</ENAMEX> These intermediate-sized
        protein aggregates are referred to as oligomers or protofibrils. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have argued
        that since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A30P</TIMEX> causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oligomers</ENAMEX>/protofibrils are the authentic toxic species. It
        is generally assumed that fibrils are the form of Œ±-synuclein deposited into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>,
        but whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewy</ENAMEX> bodies damage cells is controversial. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequestering Œ±</ENAMEX>-synuclein into this insoluble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and compartmentalizing the potentially
        toxic species away from possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> represents an
        attempt of the cell to protect itself (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanow et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        Whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is damaging or neuroprotective, there are clearly several possible
        targets for toxic Œ±-synuclein within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. For example, aggregated Œ±-synuclein can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permeabilize</ENAMEX> cellular membranes and thus might damage organelles (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volles</ENAMEX> and Lansbury
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). Mitochondrial function and synaptic transmission may be especially affected, and
        both of these can secondarily increase oxidative stress within the cytosol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenamyre</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings 2004).</ENAMEX> When overexpressed, mutant Œ±-synuclein can inhibit the proteasome
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrucelli et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), a multiprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> that degrades many unwanted or
        inappropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in cells. Mutant forms of Œ±-synuclein also inhibit
        chaperone-mediated autophagy, another important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> turnover pathway that involves
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysosomes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuervo et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> effects, it is likely that cells with
        aggregated Œ±-synuclein will become less able to handle damaged or misfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It is
        also possible that other cellular processes that we have not yet identified are affected by
        the presence of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has such an innate tendency to aggregate.
        Presumably, neurons require <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ±-synuclein</NUMEX> for their normal function and thus cannot simply
        dispense with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has toxic properties, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in which the Œ±-
        synuclein gene is knocked out have no obvious deficits (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dauer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Przedborski</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>] for discussion).
      
      
        Parkin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PINK1</ENAMEX> in Neuroprotection
        Evolution has provided cells with many ways to protect themselves. As we will see,
        mutations that cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">recessive diseases</ENAMEX> result in the loss of these neuroprotective
        functions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in recessive parkinsonism are, in order of discovery, 
        parkin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX>, and 
        PINK1 . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein products</ENAMEX> of these genes all have different
        functions, thus implicating several different cellular functions in neuroprotection. Parkin
        is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ubiquitin‚Äìprotein ligase</ENAMEX>, promoting the addition of ubiquitin to target proteins
        prior to their degradation by the proteasome. The identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parkin</ENAMEX>'s function was
        facilitated by the observation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> contains a RING finger (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang et al. 2000)</ENAMEX>,
        a common motif amongst this class of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX>. Several parkin substrates have been
        proposed, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> are damaging to neurons if they are allowed to accumulate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2003</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> Therefore, our best evidence to date indicates that parkin
        benefits neurons by removing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that might otherwise damage the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. In fact,
        expression of parkin is neuroprotective in a number of contexts, and there is even evidence
        for a beneficial effect of this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E3</NUMEX> ligase on mitochondrial function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shen</ENAMEX> and Cookson
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PINK1</TIMEX> are limited, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> motifs that indicate its likely
        cellular role. At the amino-terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PINK1</ENAMEX> is a mitochondrial-targeting sequence, and
        mitochondrial localization has been confirmed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study published to date (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valente</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2004</ENAMEX>). Most of the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PINK1</ENAMEX> is a Serine/Threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase domain,
        followed by a short carboxy-terminal region of unclear significance. The substrates of
        PINK1 have not yet been identified, but presumably phosphorylation of these substrates
        controls some critical function for neuronal survival. In their paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valente</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PINK1</ENAMEX> decreases damage to mitochondria induced by proteasome
        inhibition, but a recessive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant PINK1</ENAMEX> is unable to protect cells.
        The discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> functions gets more complicated in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX>. Unlike
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parkin</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PINK1</TIMEX>, there are no motifs within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> that hint strongly at a single function.
        Instead, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a large superfamily of genes with several different
        functions across <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bandyopadhyay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cookson 2004).</ENAMEX> These include proteases in
        thermophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, transcription factors, and chaperones that promote protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">refolding</ENAMEX>. Several research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have published data in support of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX>-1 having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
        more of these activities, including the report, published in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> is a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chaperone</ENAMEX> that regulates
        Œ±-synuclein, among other molecules (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shendelman et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). It is not yet firmly
        established which activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> is most relevant to recessive parkinsonism. The
        important function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> might be unrelated to any of the above activities. For example,
        there are several roles of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in modulation of transcriptional responses, which
        may be critical in maintaining neuronal viability (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonifati et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> and references
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">therein</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> is also known to be responsive to oxidative conditions, under which cysteine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are oxidized to form cysteine-sulfinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. There is some discussion about which
        cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> is oxidized; the most likely is cysteine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX>, which is present in a
        nucleophile elbow in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. We have suggested that modifying this residue precludes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> oxidation under mild conditions and also blocks the neuroprotective activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX>-1
        against mitochondrial toxicity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canet-Aviles et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Therefore, whatever the function
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX>, it seems to be related to oxidation. In support of this idea, cells with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> knocked out show increased sensitivity to oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> (Yokota
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2003</ENAMEX>). Another study published in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> shows that dopamine neurons differentiated from embryonic
        stem cells lacking functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> are especially sensitive to oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> (Martinat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2004</ENAMEX>).
        This discussion indicates that the genes responsible for recessive parkinsonism all have
        different functions but are all, in a broad sense, neuroprotective. A very difficult
        question to answer is whether this has anything to do with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ±-synuclein</NUMEX>. We have shown that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parkin</ENAMEX> can mitigate the toxicity of mutant <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ±-synuclein</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrucelli et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). Although
        there are reports that a proportion of Œ±-synuclein is a parkin substrate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shimura et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>), most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is not degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Recent
        evidence points, instead, to an important role of the lysosome, the other major pathway
        within cells for degrading unwanted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, in clearing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ±-synuclein</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuervo et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        On balance, therefore, there is no direct evidence that parkin controls Œ±-synuclein
        toxicity by an effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, parkin does not just
        prevent Œ±-synuclein toxicity: it is beneficial against several other stresses (discussed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cookson 2004</ENAMEX>), leading to the possibility that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> protects neurons
        against more than just the processes implicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>.
        It has also been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> can prevent the accumulation of aggregated
        Œ±-synuclein and that cysteine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> is critical for this activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shendelman et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> is not just a chaperone for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Œ±-synuclein</NUMEX>; it can also promote refolding of
        citrate synthase, glutathione transferase, and neurofilament light. Other research groups
        have reported similar findings (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olzmann et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), although there are differences
        between these studies in which cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are thought to be required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX>-1
        function. Given that there are some differences in these results, further clarification of
        the role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX> in Œ±-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">synuclein</NUMEX>-mediated toxicity is needed. More generally, we have to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> in mind that whether recessive parkinsonism has anything to do with Œ±-synuclein is
        still an open question. What is clear is that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> rely on 
        parkin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ-1</ENAMEX>, or 
        PINK1 to protect themselves against the many stresses that they face.
        However, mutations in these genes do not cause generalized neurodegeneration; in fact, they
        tend to be more restricted and less progressive than, for example, Œ±-synuclein mutations.
        This suggests, at least to my mind, that recessive mutations indicate something about the
        neurons that are damaged in these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>. Why is this of more than academic importance?
        Perhaps by identifying the proximal events that are sufficient to cause a specific set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> to degenerate, we might begin to design therapies that address the underlying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> and not just the consequences.
