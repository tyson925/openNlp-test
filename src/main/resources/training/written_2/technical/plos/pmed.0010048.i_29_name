        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> is limited by high costs, drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, and drug-related toxicities. This has
        led <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to investigate new treatment options, including ways to boost immune
        responses to better control <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. One such approach has been termed supervised treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interruption</ENAMEX> (STI)—in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> is intermittently stopped once viral load has been
        reduced to a low level, in order to boost natural immunity by brief exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>. The
        goal is to allow for the eventual discontinuation of drug treatment.
        Preliminary evidence, published by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Walker</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Medical</ENAMEX>
        School in 
        Nature in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, suggested that this approach worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> treated in
        the earliest stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute HIV</ENAMEX> infection. HIV-1 viral loads in newly infected patients
        remained suppressed for a median of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> after therapy had been stopped. However, a
        follow up paper, published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> by the same research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, shows that the viral load
        rebounded in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>.
        “The findings are very straightforward and very important,” comments <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Douek</ENAMEX> from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaccine Research Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, who was not
        involved in the study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">“In</ENAMEX> almost every case, virus rebounded and no clinical benefit from
        the interruption could be determined.”
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> first considered the possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> after they demonstrated
        that HAART given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> recently infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> could protect T helper cells, which
        are normally destroyed in the earliest stages of infection. They hypothesized that early
        treatment of acute HIV-1 infection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> might boost the immune response, allowing it
        to control the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> infection without the need for continuous therapy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">“We</ENAMEX> did not know at
        that time whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helper cells</ENAMEX> would be functional,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”</ENAMEX> explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>. “The only way
        to tell this was to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> and see if the immune response could control the
        virus.”
        To test this hypothesis the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> did an open-label trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX>; they published
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> follow-up in the 
        Nature paper. “The key finding was that we were able to get at least
        transient control of virus in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> studied, and in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> the viral
        load was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 500</NUMEX> copies (very low!) at the time of publication,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”</ENAMEX> explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>.
        However, at that point they did not know how long the protective effects would last.
        The first evidence that protection was not complete came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> reported a case of superinfection; one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the original experiment was
        infected with a second strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>, even though the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> virus was still well
        controlled. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">“This</ENAMEX> paper was important because it indicated that the amount of immunity
        might be enough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s own virus, but might not protect against closely related
        viruses circulating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> study adds more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> since it shows that although most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> can indeed transiently control their own virus, they do so for only a limited
        amount of time. “We expanded the study to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, and now have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years</TIMEX> of
        follow-up on some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>. “Although we were able to use early
        treatment and structured treatment interruption to boost immunity and have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> control their virus, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> ultimately ‘broke through,’ meaning that
        they had a recurrence of viremia.” At the present time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> do not know what
        causes the loss of viral control.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> conclude that treatment interruptions should probably be avoided
        outside the setting of controlled clinical trials, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douek</ENAMEX> goes a step further: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">“The</ENAMEX>
        study shows that even early short-term treatment and structured treatment interruptions,
        using current strategies, impart only transient benefit and are unlikely to serve as a
        reasonable therapeutic option in the future.”
