        attributes of the rootstock with those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor plant</ENAMEX> shoot, or scion. Grafting
        essentially saved <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> wine making: when the insect 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dactylosphera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">vitifoliae</ENAMEX> devastated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> grapewine varieties
        over the course of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1800s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1900s</TIMEX>, the varieties were saved by grafting
        them onto resistant rootstocks from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. Since then, these rootstocks have been
        used to maintain the susceptible Old World cultivars. But grafting is also an excellent
        tool for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> studying systemic signals traveling between the rootstock and distal
        parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and vice versa. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palauqui et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voinnet et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) used grafting to demonstrate the spreading of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA silencing</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. However, it was a subsequent paper (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) that followed up on certain
        inconsistencies in the grafting results that pointed to subtleties important for both
        experimental design and understanding systemic signaling in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA silencing</ENAMEX> (termed posttranscriptional gene silencing in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, quelling in fungi,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> interference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>) refers to the phenomenon whereby specific gene transcript
        levels are reduced in the presence of a related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. From studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA silencing</ENAMEX> in
        several systems, much is now known about the mechanisms involved (Matzke <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mlotshwa et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 2002</ENAMEX>), but the systemic spreading in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> is still a bit of a mystery.
        Posttranscriptional gene silencing spreads <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">systemically</ENAMEX> throughout the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in
        a very characteristic manner reminiscent of viral spread. This has led to the hypothesis of
        a systemic silencing signal that is produced in the tissues where silencing is initiated
        and is then transmitted to the distant parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> where it can initiate silencing
        in a sequence-specific manner. The sequence specificity of the silencing strongly implies
        that the signal is a nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, most likely an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, but the identity of the signal
        remains unknown. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silencing</ENAMEX> spreads mainly in the direction from carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to carbon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sink</ENAMEX>, that is, from tissues such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> that export the sugar products of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">photosynthesis</ENAMEX>, to tissues such as roots that import these products, and it can take up to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX> until it is established in the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palauqui et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; Palauqui
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vaucheret</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voinnet et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonoda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishiguchi 2000).</ENAMEX>
        As expected, the discovery of this process triggered a quest for the “systemic inducer”
        of the process: a signal that travels through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and is able to initiate silencing
        in a remote location within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. Grafting was an obvious tool to use in the quest for
        this signal, as it allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">silencing source</ENAMEX> and sink tissues to be of different origin.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palauqui et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to unambiguously demonstrate that silencing
        spreads from a silenced rootstock to a nonsilenced scion. They used as a stock a transgenic
        tobacco carrying an additional copy of the endogenous nitrate reductase gene, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nia</ENAMEX> . Some of the transgenic lines generated always showed higher levels
        of 
        Nia transcripts than the wild type—as expected from the presence of an
        additional gene—and were termed class I lines. However, other transgenic lines had
        undergone silencing for both the endogenous and exogenous 
        Nia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and those were termed class II lines. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallaqui et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>)
        found that silenced class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rootstocks</ENAMEX> were able to silence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I scions. This was true
        even in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“sandwich graft</ENAMEX>,” where a wild-type (nontransgenic) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was grafted between
        the silenced stock and the nonsilenced scion. Spreading of silencing was unidirectional
        from stock to scion. Though not explicitly stated, it was implied that it took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wk</ENAMEX> after grafting for systemic silencing to occur in the scion. The reported rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>.
        Related experiments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voinnet et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>) used scions that transgenically expressed
        green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> grafted onto <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with established silencing of the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>. There, too, silencing spread through the graft to the nonsilenced scion, even
        when a wild-type section was grafted between transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rootstock</ENAMEX> and scion. Unlike the 
        Nia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>, which has an endogenous counterpart in the wildtype <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>,
        green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has no homolog in nontransgenic lines. Therefore, silencing
        spreading in the wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">“spacer”</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich grafts</ENAMEX> could not be assisted by an
        endogenous sequence. Rather, the systemic signal must have traveled all the way to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scion</ENAMEX> and induced gene silencing there. The establishment of systemic silencing took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> wk
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“direct” grafts</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> wk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich grafts</ENAMEX>. However, silencing spread to the
        scion only in some of the grafts: in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16</NUMEX> direct grafts and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich grafts</ENAMEX>.
        I found these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> were very important not only for what they proved—the existence of
        a systemic signal of silencing—but also because they gave an unequivocal answer to the
        scientific questions they posed, using relatively simple methodology. Although excited by
        these successful examples of the transmission of silencing, I kept coming back to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        questions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) what prevents transmission in some of grafts, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) why does it take
        longer to transmit silencing to the scion than it takes systemic silencing to reach the
        most remote parts of an intact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>?
        When we started working on the silencing signal ourselves, we repeated some of the above
        experiments but found somehow lower efficiencies in the initiation of silencing in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scions</ENAMEX>. We soon realized that our results were influenced by the developmental stage of our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scions</ENAMEX>. A paper from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Meins</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> shed light on some aspects of
        the grafting puzzle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> there introduced additional chitinase genes using
        bolistics, in sense or antisense orientation under the control of a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35S</NUMEX>)
        into chitinase transformant lines of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> that never exhibited spontaneous gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silencing</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). In lines bombarded late in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">plant</ENAMEX> development, triggering of
        silencing was rarely observed. However, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> was introduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, a large portion of the lines showed a substantial decrease and eventually full
        suppression of the chitinase mRNA levels. Lines that showed silencing were used as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rootstocks</ENAMEX> and nonsilencing lines were used as scions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of grafting
        experiments. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> type of grafting experiment, called top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grafting</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-cm</NUMEX> scion
        cut into a wedge at the bottom was inserted into the vascular ring at the cut surface of a
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-cm-high rootstock</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type of experiment, reciprocal transverse
        grafts of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-cm-</NUMEX>tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> were exchanged between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>).
        Finally, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> type of experiment involved plug grafts, which were made by exchanging
        transverse plugs of stems cut with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-mm-diameter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cork borer</ENAMEX> from an internode
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> in the middle of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50-cm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>).
        Surprisingly, only top grafting resulted in scions that were systemically silenced by a
        rootstock signal. Furthermore, even transmission after top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grafting</ENAMEX> was less effective than
        expected; in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> stock/scion combination <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 27</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> grafts exhibited transmission of
        the silencing signal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> also found that antisense-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">silencing</ENAMEX> was never
        transmitted to the scion. These findings do not answer the many questions about the
        mechanisms underlying systemic silencing, but they point us in certain directions.
        The individual parts of a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> are, in terms of import and export, in an
        equilibrium that changes with development. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grafting</ENAMEX> takes place, how this equilibrium
        is altered depends on the individual “parts” that contribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">“new” whole plant</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, there is now indirect evidence (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fagard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vaucheret 2000</ENAMEX>) that what is source
        tissue and what is sink tissue in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> transport affects what is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and what
        is sink in terms of the systemic silencing signal. Taking into account the above findings
        and choosing the right combination of stock/scion, we have managed to significantly
        increase the efficiency of graft-transmitted silencing, a prerequisite for continuing the
        search for the systemic signal.
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grafting</ENAMEX> experiments to date, it is now evident that the transporting capacity
        of the vascular tissue bypass that is formed at the graft junction does not fully reach the
        level of the original vascular tissue. The basis for these restrictions is not known. In a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>, the graft interface functions as an unintentional filter. If the specificities of this
        “filter” were known, it would help us comprehend some transmission inconsistencies. Keeping
        in mind these limitations, grafting remains an invaluable tool in the search for the
        systemic silencing signal.
