        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who believed that the results of the global research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> should be a
        freely available public resource. So why did PLoS become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, and what are we doing
        in this role to serve the world's varying biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and clinicians?
        At its inception, the first action by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> was to encourage scientific and medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> to make the archival research literature freely available. An open
        letter, signed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 34,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> to deposit
        copies of their research articles in a full text public repository, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed Central</ENAMEX>,
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> of publication. Sadly, the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> declined to
        deposit their works‚Äîa depressing situation that continues to this day.
        We concluded that the only way forward was to publish our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. These would
        provide an alternative, open-access venue for important discoveries in science and medicine
        and would serve as a model for showing that open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> is viable.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of our life as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> involved launching our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">flagship journals‚</ENAMEX>Äî
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2003</TIMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2004</TIMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> provide an open-access
        alternative to the best subscription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> in the life sciences and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>,
        respectively.
        These <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> have helped to put open access on the map. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18 months</TIMEX> since
        we started as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> not only have many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> embraced these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fledgling journals</ENAMEX>
        as a top tier ‚Äúhome‚Äù for their work, but also there has been growing international support
        for open-access initiatives.
        For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> worldwide have so far signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Berlin Declaration</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open</ENAMEX>
        Access to Knowledge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science and Humanities</ENAMEX>. Beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who
        are funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> are being asked by the agency
        to deposit a copy of their accepted research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed Central</ENAMEX>. And in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome Trust</ENAMEX> is making it a requirement of its grant conditions that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome Trust‚Äìfunded</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> deposit an electronic version of their manuscripts in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UK</ENAMEX> portal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed Central</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> of publication.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> is now entering its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>, in which we launch the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. The case for launching these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> was compelling‚Äîwe wanted to
        serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> that had few open-access alternatives to the subscription
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>. As a result, we are launching 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Computational Biology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ploscompbiol</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), a collaboration
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Society for Computational Biology</ENAMEX>, scheduled to start
        publishing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2005</TIMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Genetics</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plosgenetics</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2005</TIMEX>; and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Pathogens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plospathogens</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2005</TIMEX>.
        With the arrival of the community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, we are providing a greater range of
        open-access venues for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who wish to ensure that anyone can read, use, and build
        on their work. Unlike 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , which are run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, each community
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX> is run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> itself‚Äîthat is, by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic editor-in-chief</ENAMEX> and
        editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, with production support from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>-led nature of the
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, coupled with a business model in which publication costs are borne largely by
        publication charges, provides an example for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> that wish to transition to open
        access.
        When submitting their work to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX>, how do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and clinicians distinguish
        between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>? 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> remains committed to publishing the best medical research
        that is relevant to a broad international community of clinicians and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. The
        community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> are aimed at a more specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Pathogens</ENAMEX> , for example, will publish basic scientific research that
        ‚Äúsignificantly advances the understanding of pathogens and how they interact with their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> organisms.‚Äù But we also think that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will find much of interest in the community
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>, and vice versa, and we will cross-link between articles in the different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>.
        The different PLoS <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> will be editorially independent and submissions will remain
        confidential to each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>. But if an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> would like a manuscript that is not thought
        to be appropriate by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> to be passed on to another, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>'
        reports and their identities, we are happy to cooperate, subject to the permission of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reviewers</ENAMEX>. This can help to speed up the review process.
        As we roll out the new community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, we are already planning the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> phase of
        our life as a publisher‚Äîthe creation of an online repository for all technically sound
        research reports in both biology and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, including clinical trial reports. It is an
        ambitious plan, but one that we believe will provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> with more choices and in the
        end, an open-access venue for the widest range of research.
