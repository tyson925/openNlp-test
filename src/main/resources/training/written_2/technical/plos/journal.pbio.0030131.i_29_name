        A growing number of studies are reporting the isolation of cardiac stem cells from a
        variety of tissue sources and examining their effects on promoting the repair of the
        injured heart. In the current issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> , the storyline takes an unexpected, interesting twist, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Epstein</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> report the isolation of a novel cell type from skeletal
        muscle that can adopt a highly differentiated cardiac muscle cell phenotype in vitro and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vivo</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        In this study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> use a differential isolation procedure to remove the skeletal
        muscle cells and myoblasts (immature muscle cells), and then collect the cells that are
        negative for a cell-surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sca-1</ENAMEX>. Under defined in vitro conditions, these
        cells adopt a cardiomyocyte phenotype that goes beyond the simple expression of
        cardiac-restricted biochemical and molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>, extending to the types of single-cell
        physiological functions that are hallmarks of authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cardiomyocytes</ENAMEX>, including action
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">potentials</ENAMEX>, calcium transients, and contractile activity. They call the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells Spoc cells</ENAMEX>,
        an acronym for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">“skeletal</ENAMEX>-based precursor of cardiomyocytes.”
        The study goes on to show that these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can adopt this phenotype without the addition
        of cytokines or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> such as azacytidine that are known to activate the muscle gene
        program in nonmuscle cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> also adopt the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac phenotype</ENAMEX> following their in
        vivo implantation into the ischemic heart following myocardial infarction, suggesting a
        potential therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for these cells. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoc</ENAMEX> cells were isolated from murine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle, they may eventually allow the use of sophisticated conditional genetic
        tracking techniques to monitor the migration, maturation, and differentiation of the cells
        in the in vivo context.
        Of course, a study with results this unexpected also raises a number of intriguing
        questions. Identifying the native location of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoc</ENAMEX> cells, as well as the in vivo niche that
        insulates them from entering the differentiated cardiac program, will be valuable. A
        rigorous exploration of their developmental origin and their relationship to the other
        well-known cell types in skeletal muscle should be forthcoming. In this regard, a set of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle stem cells, distinct from myoblasts, has also been found [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], and the
        question arises as to whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spoc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are related to these other skeletal muscle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progenitors</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardiomyocyte Precursors Abound</ENAMEX>
        Other studies have reported the isolation of cells that can differentiate into cardiac
        muscle from diverse noncardiac tissues. In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can adopt defined features of the cardiomyocyte phenotype when they are
        implanted into injured heart following myocardial infarction. It is possible that these
        studies are pointing to the existence of a rare circulating pool of precursor cells, which
        are able to home to the heart.
        To understand the provenance of these cells, it will become critical to identify a set
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene products</ENAMEX>, or markers, that are restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spoc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and to other potential
        progenitor cells. Since the protocols for the isolation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spoc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have been
        developed in the mouse, it should also become possible to use state-of-the-art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spatial</ENAMEX> and
        temporal control strategies for triggering irreversible lineage tracers in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in
        the in vivo context without isolating the cells per se. This will make it possible to
        follow the fate of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> as they differentiate. Similar approaches have recently been
        used to identify a subset of rare, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native cardiac progenitors</ENAMEX> (which are positive for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker Islet</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in the newborn hearts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]). Exploring
        the relationship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spoc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native cardioblasts</ENAMEX> could reveal shared
        pathways that drive their formation, renewal, and differentiation.
      
      
        Defining a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">True Progenitor</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the inherent caveats of the present study is the potential for phenotypic drift
        that occurs with prolonged growth of any cell type. It is possible, for example, that the
        genetic program of these cells gradually changes with time such that they can more easily
        adopt the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac phenotype</ENAMEX>. Heart and skeletal muscle share many key gene regulatory
        factors and downstream genetic programs, and the loss of a few key negative regulatory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">checkpoints</ENAMEX> might allow the cells to differentiate towards a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac phenotype</ENAMEX>. Again,
        documenting the existence of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the in vivo context, particularly during stages
        of embryonic myogenesis, will be key.
        There is already a clear precedent for this type of phenotypic drift between cardiac and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle. H9c2 cells were originally derived from rat heart, but actually represent
        skeletal myoblasts, because they fuse and form myotubes following serum withdrawal. These
        cells express myogenic factors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MyoD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and do not express cardiac-restricted
        factors. Although the cells were initially isolated on the basis of their expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac markers</ENAMEX>, this is an example phenotypic drift—that is, the cells have drifted from a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac phenotype</ENAMEX> during repeated passage rather than simply representing skeletal muscle
        cells <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> within the heart. Thus, the isolation of an immature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> from a heart does
        not necessarily denote that it is serving as a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac progenitor</ENAMEX> or stem cell. Potentially
        the same issue might hold for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">putative cardiac</ENAMEX> progenitor cells isolated from skeletal
        muscle, where the phenotype observed may not necessarily reflect its role in vivo within
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the difficulties with alchemy and this new age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac myocyte biology</ENAMEX> is
        related to defining a rigorous set of criteria that allow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to make the claim that the
        cell type of interest is truly a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac progenitor</ENAMEX> or stem cell and is acquiring a fully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">differentiated phenotype</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. In this regard, the paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> has done
        an admirable job of scoring for functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX> (for example, having action
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">potentials</ENAMEX> and calcium transients) that are far beyond the simple expression of cardiac
        muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">markers</ENAMEX>, which has been the phenotypic endpoint for many previous papers in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> go on to show the acquisition of the differentiated cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> in the in vivo <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the absence of fusion with neighboring cardiac muscle
        cells, which has been a confounding variable in most other studies of this type. If a
        precursor cell simply fuses with a fully differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in a tissue, one could easily
        be fooled into thinking that the precursor has itself differentiated, as has been found for
        many types of putative cardiac stem cells [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Fortunately, techniques have been devised to
        detect such events.
        In surveying the growing number of studies and claims of new cells that can acquire some
        type of heart cell phenotype in vitro or in vivo (for a review see [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]), it will become
        increasingly important to create a set of rigorous criteria that would distinguish between
        the following: authentic progenitor cells that are already committed to the cardiac
        lineage; pluripotent stem cells that can infrequently adopt the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac phenotype</ENAMEX>;
        phenotypic drift of other muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> with an increased propensity to enter cardiac
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>; and a variety of other cell types that can aberrantly express cardiac markers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ectopically</ENAMEX> or by fusion with neighboring cardiac muscle cells.
        Finding cell-type-specific markers for these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> will be critical, as opposed to
        generalized markers that do not allow the in vivo discrimination of their precise
        localization, mobilization, and differentiation in the intact muscle. The gold standard
        would then become the isolation of the cells from the intact organ after differentiation
        has occurred by creating genetically based or antibody-based approaches to identify and/or
        purify the already differentiated progeny from the intact muscle. Alternatively, new
        two-photon confocal microscopy approaches to identify the cells and then to monitor cardiac
        function in the intact heart should prove valuable [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX>, the bulk of our knowledge of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> that guide cardiac
        growth, development, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> has been gleaned from a combination of in vivo studies in
        genetically engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and primary cultures of neonatal and adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat cardiomyocytes</ENAMEX>.
        Perhaps the most scientifically exciting aspect of this new age of cardiomyocyte biology is
        not simply related to cardiac repair. To date, there have been no continuous differentiated
        cardiac cell lines, a fact that has hampered the field for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. The development of
        well-characterized cardiac progenitor cells offers the promise of using real genetic-based
        approaches to rapidly define the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> pathways that guide <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac contractility</ENAMEX>,
        excitability, and lineage diversification into atrial, ventricular, and conduction system
        myocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell lineages</ENAMEX>.
