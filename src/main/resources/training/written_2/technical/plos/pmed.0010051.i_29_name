        A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38-y</NUMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Down syndrome</ENAMEX> was admitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for investigation of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mo
        history of anorexia and weight loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> lbs. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six months</TIMEX> prior to admission, her weight
        was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> lbs, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>. On admission, her complete blood count was
        normal, but over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-wk period</TIMEX> she developed acute pancytopenia (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
        acute episode, her lowest hematological parameters were as follows: hemoglobin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">80 g/l</ENAMEX>
        (normal range <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120â€“160 g/l</ENAMEX>); mean cell volume (MCV), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> fl (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80â€“95</NUMEX> fl); white blood cell
        count (WBC), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.8â€“10.8 Ã—</NUMEX> 10
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 /l</ENAMEX>); absolute neutrophil count, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5â€“6.2 Ã—</NUMEX> 10
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 /l</ENAMEX>); and platelet count, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76 Ã— 10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150â€“350</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 /l</ENAMEX>).
        She had been taking carbamazepine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 y</TIMEX> and sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 y</NUMEX> for a mixed
        seizure disorder. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 22</TIMEX> y, before starting any anticonvulsants, her baseline
        hematological parameters were as follows: Hb,123 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/l; MCV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> fl; platelets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.7</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 /l.</ENAMEX> After starting carbamazepine, her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.5â€“5.5 Ã—</NUMEX> 10
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX>, and her absolute neutrophil count dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2.5</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 /l.</ENAMEX> When the sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX> was added, her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCV</ENAMEX> increased to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> fl,
        her platelet count fell to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100â€“150</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX>, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hb</ENAMEX> dropped to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">110â€“120 g/l.</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> on admission were carnitine and low-dose L-thyroxine for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothyroidism</ENAMEX>; she had been taking both for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>. She had not been recently
        exposed to any new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, environmental toxins, or over-the-counter dietary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supplements</ENAMEX>. There was no family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aplastic anemia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> lived at home with
        her mother, who cares for her and has legal guardianship.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow biopsy</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) showed a hypocellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow</ENAMEX> with a normal
        myeloid:erythroid ratio and no malignant cells or megaloblastic changes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytogenetic</ENAMEX> study
        showed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robertsonian</ENAMEX> (i.e., of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>) translocation of Chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 and 21</NUMEX>
        involving the long arm of Chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>. Except for mild adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX> noted on an
        adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test, all her tests, including viral and
        immunological investigations to identify known causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aplastic anemia</ENAMEX>, were negative.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s thyroid function tests were normal. She was started on low-dose
        hydrocortisone for her adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insufficiency</ENAMEX> and megestrol acetate to increase her
        appetite.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s carbamazepine was discontinued. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> d, her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> had risen to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.7</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX> and her platelet count to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">248</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6 /l. Serial</ENAMEX> complete blood counts showed worsening <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> over the next
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 wk</TIMEX>, requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> packed red blood cell transfusions at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week 6 and week 14</TIMEX>, when her Hb
        was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 and 53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/l</ENAMEX>, respectively. Throughout this period, her reticulocyte count was low, at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.18%</NUMEX> (normal range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX>%â<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">€“2%</NUMEX>), while her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> and platelet count were normal. We made a
        diagnosis of pure red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell aplasia</ENAMEX> (PRCA). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow biopsy</ENAMEX> under minimally
        conscious sedation was unsuccessful, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> declined further attempts. After the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transfusion she was started on prednisone and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">erythropoietin</ENAMEX> for her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRCA</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile,
        because of her worsening seizures, we increased her sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX> dose, increasing her
        serum valproate level from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mcg</ENAMEX>/ml to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">110 mcg/ml.</ENAMEX> After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> transfusion, we
        discontinued her sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX> and started her on clonazepam and oxcarbazepine as
        alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anticonvulsants</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had a brisk reticulocyte response. Her reticulocyte count rose from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.36%</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.78%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second week</TIMEX> and to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.61%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth week</TIMEX> after stopping the valproate. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after stopping the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hb</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/l</ENAMEX> and her MCV was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106</NUMEX> fl, suggesting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> of transfused red blood cells with newly formed red blood cells (which have a
        higher MCV than older transfused cells). Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 30</TIMEX> mo of follow-up, she had no
        relapse of her aplastic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>.
        We were unable to identify a specific cause for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s anorexia and weight loss.
        We found no evidence of malignancy on admission or subsequent follow-up. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 wk of</TIMEX>
        stopping her sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX>, her appetite improved and she put on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> lbs over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 6</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wk</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth month</TIMEX> after stopping the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, she had gained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> lbs.
        We last saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2004</TIMEX>. Her seizure control had worsened, and she had
        developed signs of early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dementia</ENAMEX>. Her current anticonvulsants are clonazepam,
        oxcarbazepine, and zonisamide, and she continues taking synthroid. Her last complete blood
        count was stable: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6 /l</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hb</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/l; MCV</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104.9</NUMEX> fl; and platelets, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">262</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>

        Discussion
        Sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX> and carbamazepine are associated with rare but potentially lethal
        hematological complications. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> case reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRCA</ENAMEX> shortly after initiation
        of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX>, with the longest interval between the initiation of therapy and the
        onset of aplasia being 2 y [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,4,5</NUMEX>]. Acute bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> suppression with leucopenia and
        thrombocytopenia associated with carbamazepine most often occur within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 mo of</NUMEX> starting
        treatment [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7</NUMEX>]. As far as we know, our case report is unique in that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> developed
        acute bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow suppression</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRCA</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 y</TIMEX> of carbamazepine and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 y</NUMEX> of sodium
        valproate therapy.
        Our investigations ruled out most of the known causes of acute bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> suppression,
        making the anticonvulsants the most likely cause. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malnutrition</ENAMEX> was an unlikely cause: her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> and platelet counts had recovered before any increase in appetite or weight gain; her
        body mass index was normal despite her weight loss; and her bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX> iron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> were
        adequate and her serum folate and vitamin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B12</TIMEX> levels were high, suggesting adequate
        nutrient supply.
        We considered and rejected the possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Down syndromeâ€“associated aplastic anemia</ENAMEX>.
        There have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> case reports of this condition, and in all cases it occurred in young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, suggesting a genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predisposition</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Half of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> died, and half
        responded partially to androgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>, and her bone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX>
        had responded to the withdrawal of her anticonvulsants and not to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
        androgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX>. She had failed to respond to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-wk course of high-dose non-androgenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">erythropoietin</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> did not have a relapse of her aplastic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> mo of follow-up, suggesting a lack of genetic disposition.
        The brisk return of her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WBC</ENAMEX> and platelet counts upon discontinuing carbamazepine, and
        her brisk reticulocytosis upon discontinuing sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX>, were both consistent with
        previous reports of hematological toxicity due to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,4,5,6,7</NUMEX>]. What was
        unusual in our case was the extremely late onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone marrow suppression</ENAMEX> after
        initiation of drug therapy. The persistent suppression of erythropoietic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> wk
        after stopping the carbamazepine was unlikely to be due to persistent residual marrow
        suppression by carbamazepine, since carbamazepine-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PRCA</ENAMEX> responds quickly (within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1â€“2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wk</ENAMEX>) to stopping the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,9</NUMEX>]. We believe that the continued use of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX>,
        after stopping the carbamazepine, caused the persistent suppression of erythropoietic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>.
        We found no cause for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s anorexia and weight loss, but her appetite returned
        and she gained weight after stopping the sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">valproate</ENAMEX>. There is a known association
        between this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and anorexia [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
