        differentiation, from the earliest stem cells through to the highly specialized types that
        make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s organs. Hence, a number of different tissues may derive from common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precursors</ENAMEX>. For example, muscle, fat, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> are all derived from a group of
        mesenchymal precursor cells that originate in the paraxial mesoderm. So pluripotent (i.e.,
        able to differentiate into any cell type) human embryonic stems cells are potentially a
        starting point for the regeneration of all types of diseased or damaged organs (and already
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have shown that it is possible to stimulate human embryonic stem cells to
        differentiate into specific cell types such as neural or hematopoietic cells). The
        isolation of intermediate multipotent stem cells (which can differentiate into a limited
        number of cell types) may also be valuable. For example, the production of an unlimited
        supply of mesenchymal precursors would be very useful, not only for the understanding of
        how cells differentiate, but also for eventual practical application.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenz Studer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sloan-Kettering</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> describe a protocol for deriving mesenchymal precursors, which they
        then show are capable of differentiating into specialized cell types.
        They used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> undifferentiated stem cell lines‚Äîfrom the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> lines that were approved in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> for use in federally funded research in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The
        specifications for approval for these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> are clear‚Äîsee the guidelines at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://stemcells.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nih</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/research/registry/eligibilityCriteria.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asp</ENAMEX>. The number of human
        embryonic stem cell lines available for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are strictly limited, making it
        necessary to develop protocols that expand these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> along various lineages.
        In order to differentiate the cells into mesenchymal precursors, the stem cell lines
        were cocultured with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> feeder cells to produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different polyclonal lines. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> then cultured these polyclonal precursors with appropriate tissue-specific
        stimulation in attempt to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX>, bone, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX>, or muscle cells. The evidence that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> provide for these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> being differentiated includes analysis of gene
        expression, surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigens</ENAMEX>, and immunocytochemistry typical of the mature tissues. For
        example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> were able to show the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat granules</ENAMEX> in adipocytes, calcium
        in the matrix of osteogenic cells, and collagen in chondrocytes. It was harder to produce
        muscle cells, but even these types of cells could eventually be induced by specific culture
        conditions.
        What are the possible concerns about these types of studies? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> obvious one is the
        potential for residual undifferentiated cells to turn into tumors, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> tested
        the differentiated cell cultures for cell surface markers characteristic of
        undifferentiated cells and found no evidence of them. Another worry for the use of these
        cells directly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is the need, at least at the beginning, to culture the cells with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse feeder cells‚</ENAMEX>Äîobviously no human treatment could contain cells contaminated with mouse
        cells. Further development of protocols will be needed to address this issue. However, as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> comment, ‚Äúthe high purity, unlimited availability, and multipotentiality of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hESMPCs</ENAMEX> [human embryonic stem cell‚Äìderived mesenchymal precursor cells] will provide the
        basis for future therapeutic efforts using these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in preclinical animal models of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.‚Äù In addition, the techniques described here will provide a very useful resource
        for studying mesenchymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell development</ENAMEX>.
