        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> is the leading primary diagnosis for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. Beyond recommending lifestyle changes such as losing weight, quitting smoking, and
        lowering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and alcohol intake, prescription drugs are indicated in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. As a
        consequence, antihypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are the leading category of prescription drugs in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of prescription drug sales.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are available for treatment, including diuretics, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, and calcium channel blockers. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-line treatment with thiazide diuretics—the
        oldest and by far the cheapest drug class—has been shown in randomized trials to reduce
        serious cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality with benefits at least as great as
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line treatment with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> classes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Morgan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> set out to examine whether prescribing practices were in
        accordance with this evidence. They analyzed administrative claims data from a public drug
        plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65 and older</TIMEX>) to determine trends in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line
        hypertension <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use. During the period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993 to 2000</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 82,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> were
        identified as new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiazides</ENAMEX> (alone or as part of a combination regimen) as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line treatment.
        The share of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving a thiazide increased over the study period, but did
        not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> at any point. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> were more likely than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were more
        likely than younger ones, to receive thiazides. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comorbidities</ENAMEX> also influenced prescribing
        practices: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without concurrent diagnoses were more likely to receive thiazides.
        While for some comorbidities (such as previous acute myocardial infarction) evidence
        suggested that there were good reasons to prescribe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> other than thiazides, no such
        evidence existed for many of the other conditions that nevertheless were associated with
        lower prescription of thiazides.
        Changes in drug availability and existing evidence during the period studied make it
        difficult to calculate the exact extent to which thiazides were under-prescribed. However,
        the study shows that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that had previously been found to be no
        better at treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> than much cheaper alternatives. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drug</ENAMEX> prices changed over
        the study period as well, but even comparing the lowest price for any of the alternatives
        to thiazides, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.34</NUMEX> per day, with the constant cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $ 0.01</NUMEX> per day for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiazide</ENAMEX> makes it clear that a lot of money was wasted.
        On a more positive note, prescription of thiazides as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line therapy rose over the
        study period—from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25% to 42%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without comorbidities. Most of the increase
        occurred shortly after a specific local education campaign. This suggests that repeated
        targeting of prescribing physicians—many of whom receive regular marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> from
        pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and subscribe to the general view that newer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are better—with
        current evidence-based information should be considered.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most influential studies comparing antihypertensive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> study,
        also supported the use of thiazides as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>, and
        its results widely publicized. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Morgan</ENAMEX>, “Anecdotal evidence suggests that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALLHAT</ENAMEX> has had an influence on prescription practices, but I am not aware of a large-scale
        analysis yet.”
