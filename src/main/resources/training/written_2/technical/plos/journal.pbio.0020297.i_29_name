              dog embraced so many unlike specimens of differing sizes and different forms; he was
              disturbed by the fact that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> (seen in profile) should have the
              same name as the dog at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> (seen from the front).<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¶Without</ENAMEX> effort, he had
              learned <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>. I suspect, nevertheless, that he was not
              very capable of thought. To think is to forget a difference, to generalize, to
              abstract. In the overly replete world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funes</ENAMEX> there were nothing but details, almost
              contiguous details.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù ‚ÄîJorge Luis Borges</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúFunes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorius‚</ENAMEX>Äù
            
          
        
        We are told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are divided into experimentalists and theoreticians. The
        dialectic description of the dynamics of science, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> gathering data and
        collecting evidence and another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> providing form to these observations, has striking
        examples that argue for the importance of synthesis. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 16th century</TIMEX> revolution, which
        settled the way in which we see the sky <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, is probably one of the best examples of how
        comparatively ineffective each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> can be in isolation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tycho Brahe</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exquisite observer</ENAMEX>, who built, calibrated, and refined instruments to see in the sky what
        no one else could, collected the evidence to prove a theory that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copernicus</ENAMEX> had already
        stated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years before</TIMEX> (in a book he dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>). It was only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years later</TIMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX> established the bridge between theory and observation; he understood the data in
        terms of the theory and thereby cemented the revolution. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copernicus</ENAMEX>'s statements, showed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX>, were not only figments of his imagination; they were an adequate description of
        the universe as he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahe</ENAMEX> had observed it.
        Since my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> steps in biology, after a prompt departure from physics and mathematics,
        I have looked for such encounters between theory and experiment. I began studying the
        visual system and the series of fundamental works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atneave</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barlow</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atick</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) on the relationship between our visual world and the way the brain processes
        it. Their research was based on a simple hypothesis: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the images that we see are highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundant</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the optic nerve is a limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, thus the retina has to compress
        information. Compression, redundancy? How do such concepts relate to the biology of the
        brain?
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the last century</TIMEX>, working on the problem of communications, languages,
        codes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Shannon</ENAMEX> proposed a very elegant theory that formalized
        intuitive ideas on the essence (and the limits) of communications (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shannon</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of its key aspects was that, depending on the code and on the input, channels
        are not used optimally and thus do not carry all the information they potentially could.
        When we compress (zip) a file, we are actually rewriting it in a more efficient (though not
        necessarily more intelligible) language in which we can store the same amount of
        information in less space. This compression has, of course, a limit (we cannot convey the
        universe in a single point), and the mere existence of an optimal code is central to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon</ENAMEX>'s idea. Attneave was probably the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to think that these ideas could help
        unravel how the brain worked, and in a long series of works relating these ideas to
        experimental data, it was shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retina</ENAMEX>'s business is mainly to get rid of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundancies</ENAMEX> in the visual world.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About four years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Feldman</ENAMEX> published a paper, similar in spirit, proposing a
        simple explanation for a long-standing problem in cognitive science about why some concepts
        are inherently more difficult to learn than others (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman 2000).</ENAMEX> An article whose first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> is to work carried out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> previously makes us suspect that an important gap
        is being filled. As in the previous experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman</ENAMEX> borrowed a theory‚Äîhe did not
        invent it‚Äîto explain longstanding and previously unexplained research in this area.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman</ENAMEX>'s idea was based on a theory developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX> that established formal
        mathematical grounds to define and measure complexity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX>'s theory was focused on
        categories, which are just subsets of a universe, a bunch of exemplars that constitute a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúDogs‚Äù</ENAMEX> is a category in the universe of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Different statements can define the
        same category, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbig dogs‚Äù</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúdogs that are not small‚Äù are the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
        and some information in the statement may be irrelevant because it does not aid in
        determining which elements belong or not. In the same way that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon</ENAMEX> spoke of a
        non-redundant code, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX> showed that categories could be defined with an optimal
        (non-redundant) statement. The length of this statement defines a measure of complexity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">termed Kolmogorov</ENAMEX> complexity.
        To visualize the intuitive nature of his theory it helps to do a thought experiment.
        Imagine a set of objects defined by, say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> features: form, color, and size. And
        imagine, for simplicity, that each feature is binary, that is, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> possible
        cases. Size is big or small, color is yellow or red, and shape can be either a triangle or
        a circle. This defines, of course, a universe of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. We can now define
        categories within this universe: for example, all the circles (a category of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exemplars</ENAMEX>), or all the big and yellow objects (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exemplars), or all the triangles that
        are not red (again <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). We can also define a category by enumeration, for
        example, the small red triangle, the big yellow circle, and the small yellow circle (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exemplars</ENAMEX>). Some rules (and thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> defined by these rules) are intuitively easier
        to define than others. ‚ÄúAll the circles‚Äù is an easier statement to make (and probably to
        remember) than ‚Äúsmall circles and yellow big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>.‚Äù This notion of difficulty is what
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX>'s theory formalized, stating that complexity was the length of the shortest
        definition (among all the possible definitions) of a given set. From this thought
        experiment, we can understand the logic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feldman</ENAMEX>'s paper, which showed that. Kolmogrov
        complexity is very closely related to our intuitive notion of conceptual difficulty.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman</ENAMEX> presented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with all possible categories (of a fixed number of exemplars) in
        different universes and showed that the critical parameter to rank the difficulty of a
        given subset was its Kolmogrov complexity. Moreover by explicitly presenting all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and the nonmembers of a category to na√Øve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, he showed that we can
        spontaneously reduce a category to its minimal form and remember it without any explicit
        instruction. Thus, what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman</ENAMEX> found, following the original ideas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepard</ENAMEX>, was that
        our psychological measure of complexity‚Äîour difficulty in defining and remembering a
        category or concept‚Äîis also determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX> complexity that describes it.
        This essay is, in a way, about how we avoid becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borges</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funes</ENAMEX>, who could
        not understand repeated observations as exemplars of a common rule and thus could not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesize</ENAMEX> and categorize. Simply, he could not think. Probably the most disappointing
        moment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feldman</ENAMEX>'s paper comes at the very end, where it deals with its (somehow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unavoidable</ENAMEX>) recursive quest. Understanding why some concepts are difficult to learn may
        itself be difficult to learn. Modern mathematics, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolmogorov</ENAMEX> complexity and
        information theory, has taught us another fundamental concept that may be relevant when
        trying to understand the logic of the mind. In a long series of paradoxes enumerated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertrand Russell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Goedel</ENAMEX>, and others, we learn that a formal system that looks at
        itself is bound to fail. At the very end of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman</ENAMEX> writes, ‚ÄúIn a sense, this
        final conclusion [that psychological complexity is Boolean complexity] may seem negative:
        human conceptual difficulty reflects intrinsic mathematical complexity after all, rather
        than some idiosyncratic and uniquely human bias.‚Äù Who invented mathematics? The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martians</ENAMEX>?
        On the contrary, I believe this result supports a more naturalistic and less Platonic
        conception of mathematics. Formal ideas in mathematics are not arbitrary constructions of
        an arbitrary architecture; rather, they reflect the workings of the brain like a massive
        collective cognitive experiment. Mathematics does not only serve to help us understand
        biology; mathematics is biology. We are not less original if our thoughts resemble our
        mental constructions, we are just consistent. It is within this loop, this unavoidable
        recursion‚Äîmathematics understanding the logic of the brain‚Äîthat we will have an opportunity
        to test, as some conspire, whether among all the wonders evolution has come out with, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> might be a brain good enough to avoid the risk of understanding itself.
