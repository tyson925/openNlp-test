        arise? What causes some minds/brains to achieve awe-inspiring artistic or scientific
        achievements? We cannot help but be fascinated by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespeare‚</ENAMEX>Äîa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> with ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Äúsmall Latin</ENAMEX> and less <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greek‚Äù‚</ENAMEX>Äîcould emerge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnowhere‚Äù</ENAMEX> of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stratford</ENAMEX> to
        create the richest literary treasure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language. We wonder how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äîa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stonecutter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who also came from a rural nowhere‚Äîfound within himself the vision to see
        the shape of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">David</ENAMEX> in a block of discarded marble or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the apolcalyptic</TIMEX> fresco of 
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Judgment</ENAMEX> on the wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sistine Chapel</ENAMEX>. What genetic
        influences shaped their brains to create‚Äîand to create these very specific wondrous things?
        How did their environments promote or impede them? Would <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> have been great
        without the patronage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medicis</ENAMEX> or the competitive edge induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>? Great art
        and great science are indeed often forged in the smithy of pain‚Äîwith the fire fueled by
        self-doubt, obsessive preoccupation, sorrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, competition, or economic
        needs.
        
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writer's Block</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative</ENAMEX>
        Brain by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Weaver Flaherty</ENAMEX> unites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intrinsically fascinating domains of
        knowledge‚Äîthe workings of the brain and the nature of creativity. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX>
        who has also become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> by virtue of having published her first nonacademic book,
        draws on her knowledge of neuroscience, her medical career as a clinician, and her
        experiences as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Early in the book, she describes her own hospitalization for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">manic-depressive illness</ENAMEX>, a disclosure that implicitly places her in the pantheon of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who have suffered from serious mental illness and provides her with
        lustre-by-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. The result of all these juxtapositions is, however, a somewhat
        disconcerting blend of pop-science and pop-confessional genres. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> frequently talks
        to us in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, but one is not quite sure which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> (the neuroscientist, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>) is actually speaking. In other words, this book has a jarring lack
        of a strong single voice, despite a knack for often finding a fine turn-of-phrase or a
        clever word choice.
        Given that the book topic is promising and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> can often write very well, it
        is dismaying that this book is not better than it is. It is written for the intelligent lay
        public, many of whom avidly collect and read ‚Äúbrain books‚Äù to expand their minds. Most
        painful is the fact that this book is filled with factual errors, glib and misleading
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">generalizations</ENAMEX>, and careless misstatements. Perhaps most shocking and most erroneous, we
        are told (by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX>!) that ‚ÄúThe tips of the temporal lobe can be lopped off without
        much changing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s behavior.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù HM</ENAMEX>, the most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to receive bilateral
        temporal lobectomy, remains frozen in a past linked to a never-changing present because he
        lost the capacity to retain new memories. Temporal lobe syndromes are discussed more
        accurately later in the book, but that is a weak excuse for this early error.
        We are also told that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúmanic depression</ENAMEX> is a genetically transmitted syndrome‚Äù (when, in
        fact, no replicable genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loci</ENAMEX> have yet been identified), that ‚Äúa very high proportion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manic</ENAMEX> depressives become writers‚Äù (the lifetime prevalence rate of bipolar disorder is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1%</NUMEX>, and only a tiny proportion of that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>), and that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúelectrophysiology</ENAMEX>, because it is dangerous, is rarely performed‚Äù (electrophysiology
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tools‚Äîe.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>, the study of evoked potentials or electroencephalograms‚Äîare noninvasive and
        frequently used; recordings of the activity of individual neurons with electrodes placed in
        the gray matter are indeed rare, but nothing from the context suggests that this particular
        type of electrophysiology is being discussed). There are many more such careless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misstatements</ENAMEX>. The intelligent lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> deserves better than this.
        The book raises and addresses a variety of interesting questions that have intrigued
        many thoughtful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two millennia</TIMEX>. What is the nature of creativity? What
        is the difference between skill and creativity? What is the relation between mental illness
        and creativity? Is creativity inhibited when mental illnesses are treated? What is the
        relation between mind and brain? The book also addresses some unique and interesting twists
        on these questions. Its focus is the domain of writing, drawing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s own
        experience of a compulsion to write, or hypergraphia, following a pyschic break. What is
        the relationship between hypergraphia and the brain? Between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and the brain?
        Are these problems always pathological, or do they sometimes enhance creativity? Does that
        college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who can't finish a term paper have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdisease‚Äù</ENAMEX>? Can ‚Äúmind-expanding‚Äù drugs
        that affect the brain enhance creativity?
        In short, 
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midnight Disease</ENAMEX> raises many important questions, but fails to
        address them completely and accurately. There is much more to learn, and much more to say,
        about the nature of creativity, its origins in the mind/brain and in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, and
        its boundaries with health and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
