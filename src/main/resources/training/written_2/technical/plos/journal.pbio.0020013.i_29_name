        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">raison d'√™tre</ENAMEX> is to remove unnecessary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> by breaking them down into short peptides.
        The proteasome is thus responsible for an important aspect of cellular regulation because
        the timely and controlled proteolysis of key cellular factors regulates numerous biological
        processes such as cell cycle, differentiation, stress response, neuronal morphogenesis,
        cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor modulation</ENAMEX>, secretion, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair, transcriptional regulation,
        long-term memory, circadian rhythms, immune response, and biogenesis of organelles
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glickman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ciechanover 2002).</ENAMEX> With the multitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrates</ENAMEX> targeted and the myriad
        processes involved, it is not surprising that aberrations in the pathway are implicated in
        the pathogenesis of many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
        With so many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to target for degradation, the activity of the proteasome is
        subject to multiple levels of regulation. In the overwhelming majority of cases, selected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are first <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúlabeled‚Äù</ENAMEX> by the addition of several copies of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> tag
        called ubiquitin and are thus targeted for degradation in the proteasome (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The
        ubiquitination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is regulated through precise selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> substrates by
        specific E3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitin</ENAMEX> ligases (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickart 2001).</ENAMEX> These enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> each recognize a
        subset of substrates and tag them by linking the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> via an amide bond (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Interestingly, ubiquitination is a reversible process. Even when a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has been
        tagged with ubiquitin, its fate is not sealed‚Äîspecific hydrolytic enzymes called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deubiquitinases</ENAMEX> can remove the ubiquitin label intact (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). By deubiquitinating their
        substrates, these enzymes compete with the proteasome, which acts on the polyubiquitined
        form. In the competition between proteolysis and deubiquitination, polyubiquitinated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> rarely accumulate in the cytoplasm of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúhealthy‚Äù cells</ENAMEX>, as they are either
        irreversibly degraded or deubiquitinated and rescued. It is thought that this competition
        provides a certain level of stringency or quality control to the system. Based on sequence
        homology, deubiquitinating enzymes were traditionally classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>:
        ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs or USPs) and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCHs</ENAMEX>). Both enzyme <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are classified as cysteine proteases that employ an active
        site thiol to cleave ubiquitin from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kim et al. 2003; Wing 2003</ENAMEX>).
        The proteasome itself is made up of a multiprotein core particle (CP) where proteolysis
        occurs and a separate multiprotein regulatory particle (RP) that recognizes and prepares
        substrates for degradation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CP</ENAMEX>. A base subcomplex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RP</ENAMEX> is pivotal in anchoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyubiquitin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> during this process, either directly or via auxiliary
        ubiquitin-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lam et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartmann-Petersen et al. 2003).</ENAMEX> The base
        attaches to the outer surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CP</ENAMEX> and uses energy to unravel the substrate,
        simultaneously with preparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that leads into the proteolytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> of the CP
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forster</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). The lid subcomplex of the RP attaches to the base and is required
        for proteolysis of ubiquitin‚Äìprotein conjugates, but not of unstructured polypeptides
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glickman et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glickman 2003).</ENAMEX> The size and complexity of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-eating machine hints at the exquisite controls that must rgulate its function.
        An intriguing evolutionary and structural relationship between the proteasome lid and an
        independent complex, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">COP9</NUMEX> signalosome (CSN), may shed light on their respective roles
        in regulated protein degradation. Both are made up of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous protein</ENAMEX> subunits
        that contain similar structural and functional motifs. While a lot is still unknown, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> appears to mediate responses to signals (e.g., light, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX>, adhesion, nutrients,
        DNA damage) in a manner that is intimately linked to the ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome system. This
        is accomplished, for instance, by suppressing ubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> ligase activity or interacting
        with various components of the pathway (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bech-Otschir et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cope</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Deshaies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng 2003).</ENAMEX> In particular, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> subunit‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ÄîCsn5‚Äîmoderates</TIMEX> SCF (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Skp1‚Äìcullin‚ÄìF box</ENAMEX>) and
        other cullin-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E3</ENAMEX> ubiquitin ligases by removal of the ubiquitin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rub1/</ENAMEX>Nedd8
        molecule from the cullin subunit of the ligase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Further analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> will no
        doubt uncover additional mechanisms whereby ubiquitin-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein degradation</ENAMEX> is
        controlled.
        Surprisingly, the proteasome itself harbors intrinsic deubiquitination activity (Eytan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 1993</ENAMEX>). Moreover, both the lid and the base contribute independently to RP
        deubiquitination activity. The source of this activity has been attributed to a number of
        different subunits. These include the associated cysteine proteases <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ubp6/USP14</ENAMEX> (Borodovsky
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2001</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legget et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">UCH37/p37</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lam et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoelzl et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Doa4/Ubp4</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papa et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), as well as the intrinsic proteasome subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rpn11/POH1</ENAMEX> (Verma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2002</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yao and Cohen 2002).</ENAMEX> The importance of these components to proteasome function
        is apparent in their partially overlapping properties. In groundbreaking work, an intrinsic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúcryptic‚Äù</ENAMEX> deubiquitinating activity that is sensitive to metal chelators has been reported
        for the proteasome, in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúclassic‚Äù cysteine</ENAMEX> protease behavior (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verma et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yao and Cohen 2002).</ENAMEX> This metalloprotease-like activity maps to the putative catalytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPN</ENAMEX>+/JAMM motif of the lid subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rpn11</ENAMEX> and lies at the heart of proteasome mechanism by
        linking deubiquitination with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> degradation. Notably, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Rpn11</NUMEX> shares close homology
        with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn5</TIMEX>, which is also responsible for proteolytic activities in its respective
        complex.
        By defining a new family of putative metalloproteases that includes a proteasomal
        subunit, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSN</ENAMEX> subunit, and additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from all domains of life, the MPN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ /JAMM</ENAMEX> motif garnered great attention. The trademark of the MPN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ /JAMM</ENAMEX> motif is a consensus sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E‚</ENAMEX>ÄîHxHx
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) Sx
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) D that bears some resemblance to the active site of zinc
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metalloproteases</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> were predicted to be hydrolytic enzymes, some of
        which are specific for removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like domains from their targets
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maytal-Kivity et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verma et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yao and Cohen 2002).</ENAMEX>
        In a further development, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> determined the molecular structure of
        an MPN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ /JAMM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from an archaebacterium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambroggio et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tran et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 2003</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> identify a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc ion chelated</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> histidines and the
        aspartic residue of the MPN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+ /JAMM</ENAMEX> sequence. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> ligand appears to be a water molecule
        activated through interactions with the conserved glutamate to serve as the active site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleophile</ENAMEX>. Overall, this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> certainly has properties consistent with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metallohydrolase</ENAMEX> and can serve as the prototype for the deubiquitinating enzymes in its
        class. This revelation adds an all-new enzymatic activity and, with it, an additional layer
        of regulation to the ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome system.
        Now that it is evident that the proteasome contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a novel metalloprotease
        family, a fundamental question can be raised: why does a proteolytic enzyme like the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasome</ENAMEX> need auxiliary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">proteases</ENAMEX> for hydrolysis of ubiquitin domains? At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> of tasks between the proteolytic subunits of the proteasome (situated in the
        proteolytic core particle) and the auxiliary deubiquitinating enzymes (situated in the
        regulatory particle) is clear-cut: the latter cleave between ubiquitin domains, while the
        core proteolytic subunits process the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> itself (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However, this still
        does not explain the mechanistic rational for finding deubiquitination within the
        proteasome itself. In principle, deubiquitination could be used for (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) recycling of
        ubiquitin, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) abetting degradation by removal of the tightly folded highly stable globular
        ubiquitin domain, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) mitigating degradation by removal of the ubiquitin anchor, without
        which the substrate is easily released and rescued. There is evidence that recycling of
        ubiquitin by the proteasome is indeed a crucial feature of deubiquitination in proper
        cellular maintenance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legget et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). Distinguishing between options <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 3</TIMEX>, however,
        depends to a large extent on the delicate balance between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proteolytic activities
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the proteasome: proteolysis and deubiquitination (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Once bound to the proteasome, a polyubiquitinated substrate can be unfolded by the RP
        and irreversibly translocated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CP</ENAMEX>. It has been proposed that long polyubiquitin
        chains commit a substrate to unfolding and degradation by the proteasome, whereas short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> are poor substrates because they are edited by deubiquitinating enzymes, resulting
        in premature substrate release (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eytan et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lam et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrower et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guterman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glickman 2003).</ENAMEX> Extended polyubiquitin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> could slow down chain
        disassembly, thereby allowing ample time for unfolding and proteolysis of the substrate
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Interestingly, both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äútrimming‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúshaving‚Äù</ENAMEX> deubiquitinating activities are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the proteasome, though the exact contribution of the various
        proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes to each of these distinct activities has yet
        to be elucidated. It is expected that in order to obtain efficient proteolysis of the
        target, shaving of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> at their proximal ubiquitin should be slower than the rate of
        trimming at the distal moiety. As an outcome of this requirement, longer polyubiquitin tags
        would be preferential substrates for degradation by the proteasome. Thus, the uniqueness of
        ubiquitin as a label for degradation may lie in its being a reversible tag.
        Deubiquitinases, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rpn11</ENAMEX>, serve as proofreading devices for reversal of fortune at
        various stages of the process, right up to the final step before irreversible degradation
        by the proteasome.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Identifying Rpn11</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Csn5</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a novel class of metallohydrolases immediately
        elevates them into promising ‚Äúdrugable‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. Undoubtedly, the molecular structures
        deciphered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deshaies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambroggio et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bycroft</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tran et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>)
        will focus efforts to design novel site-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of the ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Csn5</TIMEX> is thought to impede the action of ubiquitin ligases through shaving
        cullins from their <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Rub1/Nedd8</ENAMEX> modification (and possibly also by deubiquitinating
        substrates bound to the cullins), the outcome of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rpn11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibition</ENAMEX> will depend largely on
        whether Rpn11 participates primarily in shaving substrates from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, promoting
        release and rescue, or in trimming the polyubiquitin tag, allowing for proteolysis quality
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
