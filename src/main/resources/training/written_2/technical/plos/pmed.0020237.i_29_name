        effective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> that have been available since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>. Despite these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">billion people</ENAMEX> have been infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis B virus</ENAMEX> (HBV), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 350 million</NUMEX>
        have lifelong infections. These chronically infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are at high risk of death from
        cirrhosis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and liver <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, which both kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> each
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.
        Suppression of viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> in chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV</ENAMEX> is an effective approach to
        controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression. Current antiviral therapies include lamivudine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-interferon</ENAMEX>, but long-term resolution of the disease is disappointing because of low
        seroconversion rates and the development of drug-resistant viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutants</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa F. P. Ng</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> describe the identification
        of a host factor that has a significant effect on viral replication efficiency. The team
        began by examining the serum viral load of a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B in relation
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV</ENAMEX> genome carried. They found a significant association between high serum viral
        load and a natural sequence variant within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HBV enhancer II</ENAMEX> regulatory region at
        position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1752</TIMEX>. Upon testing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> possible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1752</TIMEX> variants, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1752A</NUMEX> variant had the
        highest transcriptional activity.
        Further investigation of this enhanced transcriptional activity revealed evidence of
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> with host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding proteins</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> found that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> present
        in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hostâ</ENAMEX>€”hnRNPKâ€”could be isolated by direct binding to a viral fragment derived
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV</ENAMEX> variant of these infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hnRNPK</ENAMEX> has previously been shown to be involved in several cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">functionsâ</ENAMEX>€”for
        example, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of signal transduction and of gene expression. On further
        examination of the role of hnRNPK in HBV replication, they established that hnRNPK is
        capable of acting on the full length of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV</ENAMEX>, rather than just a partial fragment. They
        compared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> full-length replicative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV</ENAMEX> clones, identical except for a single base change
        at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1752</TIMEX>, that were transfected with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different hnRNPK expression constructs and
        showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1752A</ENAMEX> was more efficient at promoting replication than the other three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX>.
        To further show the role of hnRNPK in HBV replication, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> tested the effect of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression and down-regulation of the cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Using siRNA, designed to
        reduce endogenous hnRNPK, they showed suppression of both hnRNPK mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBV</ENAMEX> viral load,
        whereas a control siRNA had no effect on HBV viral load.
        Despite these findings, the mechanism behind hnRNPK on HBV replication needs further
        exploration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> say, concluding that viral replication efficiency was determined
        by a combination of viral sequence and interaction with specific host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However,
        they suggest that these results indicate that although drug development of antivirals is an
        established research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, targeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is an untapped opportunity.
        They describe parallels with anti-EGFR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cells, which
        produced a decrease in cell replication rate and corresponding reduction in hnRNPK
        expression levels; this result suggested that hnRNPK levels could be modulated by anti-EGFR
        treatment, thus highlighting new treatment options for altering the HBV viral load in
        chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> conclude that the future of long-term viral clearance will require
        combination therapy of targeting the virus directly, blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> support <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and
        using immuno-modulating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
