        characterized by inflammation of the bowel, specifically ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (CD). They are common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>, for example, together they affect about
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>, amounting to a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120,000</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60,000</NUMEX> of CD, with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> new cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX> new cases of CD <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. Current estimates total at more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 million</NUMEX> cases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The symptoms for both these conditionsâ€”which
        suggest an abnormal immune response at the intestinal mucosaâ€”include abdominal pain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diarrhea</ENAMEX>, fever, severe fatigue, and weight loss. Current understanding of disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathogenesis</ENAMEX> suggests a complex action of multiple environmental factors that trigger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with a susceptible genetic background.
        Today, finding genes that have a role in diseases has been made easier by the sequencing
        of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> and creation of an expressed sequence tag clone database. Previous
        positional cloning studies have revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> that carry
        variants with a causative role. Another of the tools for analyzing genes is microarray
        technology, in which the expression of transcripts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes can be
        investigated simultaneously. This approach offers an insight into disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathophysiology</ENAMEX>.
        In a research article published in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Costello</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have gone further with
        cDNA microarrays to attempt to decipher gene regulatory events and identify genes that
        might be involved in the pathophysiology of these IBD. They found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were
        differentially regulated between normal control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with one of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> subtypes. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 and 272</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> regulated transcripts were
        identified between control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with CD and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC</ENAMEX>, respectively. There was
        an imbalance between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>- and underexpressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> subtypes. In CD,
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 84%</NUMEX> of differentially expressed genes were found to be down-regulated
        compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> caution that this finding was highly
        influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and numbers of genes present on any microarray system; in addition,
        none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes in CD and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC</ENAMEX> was overexpressed in one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and underexpressed in the other. These observations support the notion of a shared
        general inflammatory profile underlying each form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>, with more specific events in the
        pathophysiological cascade being disease-specific.
        In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of the study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> tried to interpret the functional consequences
        of changes in gene expression observed in the microarray analysis. They used an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">annotation</ENAMEX>-based pathway database, which classified differentially expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: immune and inflammatory response; oncogenesis, cell proliferation, and
        growth; or structure and permeability. For <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune</ENAMEX> and inflammatory response, the team
        identified many genes associated with aberrant immune response; it is not surprising,
        perhaps, to find a general up-regulation of immune response and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> presentation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX>. Several genes associated with cell growth and proliferation were up-regulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCâ</ENAMEX>€”a
        finding similar to previous microarray studies that had reported involvement of
        cancer-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> (although the altered genes were different). There was also an
        enrichment of genes associated with structure and permeability; in this class several genes
        were ubiquitously altered in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBD</ENAMEX> and non-IBD <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, reflecting dysregulation of
        genes for paracellular permeability, degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>, and barrier
        protection against bacterial invasion of the epithelial surface.
        Ultimately this study highlights the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC</ENAMEX> and CD, and indicates
        some possible future <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> for research of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mucosal diseases</ENAMEX> in general. It demonstrates
        that genomic technologies are suitable to directly dissect human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathophysiology</ENAMEX>.
