        tracking changes in cerebral blood flow as a subject performs a mental task, fMRI shows
        which brain regions ‚Äúlight up‚Äù when making a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>, thinking of a loved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, or telling
        a lie. Its ability to reveal function, not merely structure, distinguishes fMRI from static
        neuroimaging techniques such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX> scanning, and its capacity to highlight the neural
        substrates of decisions, emotions, and deceptions has propelled fMRI into the popular
        consciousness. Discussions of the future of fMRI have conjured visions of mind-reading
        devices used everywhere from the front door at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport terminal</ENAMEX> to the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of the
        corporate personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Äúneuromarketing‚Äù</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> is already trying
        to use fMRI to probe what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> ‚Äúreally‚Äù think about their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>' products.
        But will fMRI's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in the real world ever match the power we currently imagine for
        it? Is fMRI likely to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> for widespread use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> or the
        boardroom? Are there neuroethical nightmares just around the corner? Or are all these vivid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specters</ENAMEX> really just idle speculations that will never come to pass?
      
      
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX>
        To understand the potential, and the limitations, of fMRI, it's helpful to know how the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> works. The heart of the apparatus is a large donut-shaped magnet that senses
        changes in the electromagnetic field of any material placed in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, in
        particular‚Äîwhen a head is scanned‚Äîthe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> as it flows through the brain. When a region of
        the brain is activated, it receives an increased flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygenated blood</ENAMEX> (the extremely
        rapid redirection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> within the active brain is one of the underappreciated wonders
        supporting neural activity). This influx of oxygenated blood alters the strength of the
        local magnetic field in proportion to the increase in flow, which is detected and recorded
        by the imaging machinery.
        The resolution of the best fMRI machines‚Äîthe smallest ‚Äúvolume picture element,‚Äù or
        voxel, they can distinguish and make an image of‚Äîis currently <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 1.5 mm √ó1.5 mm √ó 4 mm</NUMEX>,
        the size of a grain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 150,000</NUMEX> of these little volumes in the
        typical brain, and the immense computers hooked up to the scanners record and integrate
        signals from all of them. In a typical experiment, a subject, lying still with his head
        surrounded by the magnet, does nothing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>, then performs some task for
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">thirty seconds</TIMEX>, then lies still for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>. For each voxel, the signal during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX> is compared to the signal at rest; those areas of the brain with stronger signals
        during the task are presumed to be processing the information that underlies the
        performance of the task (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joy Hirsch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Functional</ENAMEX>
        Magnetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resonance Imaging Research Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX>, fMRI represents a
        ‚Äúquantum leap‚Äù over any previous technology for imaging the brain. ‚ÄúIt enables us for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time to probe the workings of a normal human brain,‚Äù she says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s really opening
        the black box.‚Äù
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> caveat about fMRI's imaging power, though, and one that every neuroimager
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stresses</ENAMEX>, is that a voxel is a long way from a neuron. There are an estimated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 billion</NUMEX>
        neurons, so at best, an fMRI is signaling blood flow changes associated with the increased
        activity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of neurons. As a result, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>, fMRI ‚Äúfalls short when
        we want to ask about more detailed brain processes. We're not learning that much about how
        neurons are doing local computing.‚Äù While resolution will improve over time, it seems
        unlikely that fMRI will ever detect the activity of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX>, and so its ability
        to dissect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfine structure‚Äù</ENAMEX> of thought is inherently limited. (Even should it become
        possible to detect and integrate the workings of every neuron in the brain, it would still
        be far from clear how neuronal firing patterns translate into coherent, perceived thoughts,
        and this gap is unlikely to be bridged by any advance in imaging technology alone.)
        These limitations have not prevented fMRI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> from making some major discoveries
        about brain function, however. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>, for instance, showed in one study that minimally
        conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> still process human speech, and in another, that those who become
        bilingual as young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> employ overlapping language areas in the cerebral cortex, while
        those who learn a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> later in life use a different area for the second
        language. The key strength of fMRI, she says, is that it provides the ability to test these
        kinds of hypotheses about structure‚Äìfunction relationships in the normal brain.
      
      
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sizes Do Not Fit One</ENAMEX>
        But the hypotheses that can be tested and the conclusions that can be drawn are still
        largely about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> averages, not about the functionings of individual brains, and therein
        lies a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major caveat about the use of fMRI beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gabrieli</ENAMEX>,
        Associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of Psychology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX>, has shown that distinct
        activation patterns in the brains of dyslexic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> normalize as they improve their
        reading skills (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). It seems like a small leap from there to including an fMRI as
        part of the workup for a schoolchild struggling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>. But, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabrieli</ENAMEX> cautions,
        that small leap in fact traverses a huge chasm, on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> data from
        which conclusions are drawn in studies, and on the other side, the application of these
        conclusions to the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúAt the moment, fMRI would be among the most useless
        things to do. We would love to get it to the point that it would be useful [on an
        individual basis],‚Äù he says, but it's not there yet. ‚ÄúThere is no single-subject
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliability,‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabrieli</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúWhere we are now, I'm not aware of any applications for which
        it would be responsible to interpret an individual scan [based on group data].‚Äù
        There are similar limitations to most other applications of fMRI‚Äîwhile conclusions can
        be made about aggregated data, individual scans are for the most part too hard to
        interpret. There is not yet any real understanding of how brain patterns change over time
        in an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, or how interindividual differences should be interpreted in relation to
        the conclusions that are valid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. This makes fMRI an unlikely tool for job
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX>, for instance. While <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study has shown a brain signature in a group of white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that is associated with racial bias, denying a particular individual a job on the
        basis of such a scan would likely lead straight to a lawsuit, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> debating whether
        
        this scan in 
        this individual on 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX> does or doesn't reflect his underlying racial attitudes.
        On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX> has used individual scans to help locate a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s language
        structures that must be spared during neurosurgery. ‚ÄúIf you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurosurgeon</ENAMEX> planning a
        resection, you don't want an average brain at all. Millimeters matter.‚Äù But her success is
        precisely because she is not using group data to make inferences about the individual‚Äîshe
        is not leaping over the chasm, but instead is toiling entirely on the other side of it.
        ‚ÄúThe goal is personalized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>,‚Äù she says.
      
      
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Little Guilty Knowledge Is a Dangerous Thing</ENAMEX>
        Even this kind of personalized approach with fMRI is fraught with problems when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> attempt to apply it outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>, because of limitations in the
        technology itself. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> with firsthand knowledge of these problems is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daniel</ENAMEX>
        Langleben, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant Professor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psychiatry</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania School of</ENAMEX>
        Medicine. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Langleben</ENAMEX> showed that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were hiding information in an
        attempt to deceive (so-called guilty knowledge), they had intense activity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> distinct
        brain areas not seen when they were telling the truth. In effect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langleben</ENAMEX> used the fMRI
        as a lie detector. It is potentially even more powerful than a standard polygraph test, he
        says, because there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of brain regions which can be scanned for
        deception-triggered variation, versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> variables‚Äîskin conductance, respiration,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood pressure‚</ENAMEX>Äîused in the standard polygraph. Not surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langleben</ENAMEX> got a lot of
        press after he announced his results, and his experiment led directly to speculation that
        we might eventually see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fMRIs</ENAMEX> installed at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>, scanning the brains of would-be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> trying to deceive security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screeners</ENAMEX>, or in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtrooms</ENAMEX>, catching perjurers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">red-handed</ENAMEX> (or perhaps red‚Äìanterior-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cingulate</NUMEX>-gyrused?).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langleben</ENAMEX> is enthusiastic about the potential for an fMRI-based lie detector, and has
        even applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX> for a grant to develop the technology (they
        turned him down, saying it was too expensive). But he is also clear about how difficult it
        will be to get one that really works outside the highly structured confines of the research
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lab</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúWe are a long way from making a working polygraph,‚Äù he says. Even with a ‚ÄúManhattan
        Project‚Äù type effort, he speculates it would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least ten years</TIMEX>. ‚ÄúThere are still
        essential discoveries to make along the way,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúand there's a good chance it would
        end in total failure.‚Äù It's not just a matter of developing the imaging technology, he
        stresses‚Äî‚Äúwe'll need fundamental developments in semantics, too.‚Äù This is because ‚Äúa lot
        still depends on how you ask the question‚Äù‚Äîthe subtlest of differences can dramatically
        shift which areas of the brain respond. Given the sensitivity of the fMRI result to such
        seemingly minor perturbations, it's hard to imagine it could be reliably adapted to the
        hurly-burly of an airport security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkpoint</ENAMEX>.
        Even well-performed scans done in topnotch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> may not easily find their way into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the least likely use of fMRI is in determining if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> is
        telling the truth, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank Greely</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> of Law at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford Law School</ENAMEX>, since
        compelling someone on trial to submit to an fMRI could be seen as a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth</ENAMEX>
        Amendment right against self incrimination, just as giving spoken testimony against oneself
        is. On the other hand, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greely</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> and fingerprints can be compelled‚Äîwhether a
        brain scan is more like testifying or more like submitting to a blood test is an open
        question. Still, for the moment, scanning under duress simply isn't feasible, since all you
        have to do to ruin a good scan is move your head. Motion-correcting algorithms can be used,
        but they are nowhere near advanced enough to correct for large-scale movements by an
        unwilling subject. It's much more likely that an fMRI of a willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> would be
        introduced to convince the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> he is telling the truth, or performed before trial to rule
        out an innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX>. While to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greely</ENAMEX>'s knowledge fMRI evidence hasn't yet been used in
        court, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúit</ENAMEX>'s certain to be tried,‚Äù and the barrier to its admission will fall as both the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> and the ease of administration increase. ‚ÄúThe easier, the cheaper, the more
        pleasant a technique is, the more likely it is to be used in the legal system.‚Äù
        Other forensic uses of fMRI are likely to arrive sooner rather than later. Could scans
        showing diminished impulse control‚Äîa function controlled by several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the brain,
        including the striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex‚Äîbe used to support more
        lenient sentencing, or even acquit a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>, because he couldn't control his violent
        impulses? Or alternatively, will those same scans be used to argue for harsher sentences,
        since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> is clearly ‚Äúhardwired‚Äù to commit similar crimes again? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Courts</ENAMEX> already
        consider other factors, such as a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse, in an attempt to more fully
        understand the psychological state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>. Will brain scans be seen as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate ‚Äúobjective‚Äù</ENAMEX> look into the mind of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> on trial?
        Deciding all these issues of admissibility will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> who will need to weigh
        competing claims from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> with competing interests, backed up by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert witnesses</ENAMEX> with
        competing theories. Here, the desire to apply the science may rush ahead of its
        demonstrated validity.
        Langleben, for one, doesn't think fMRI will be legitimately ready for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> for
        a long time. On the other hand, he says, ‚Äúif you want to abuse this technique and claim
        that it works, you can create tests that will produce results‚ÄîI can see how it could be
        done. We know enough to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX> it.‚Äù But still, he says, ‚Äúwe have all the tools we need to
        prevent this‚Äîthere are enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are sufficiently honest [who would counter the
        premature use of fMRI in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contexts</ENAMEX>].‚Äù
        For now, at least, given the problems inherent in current fMRI technology, the
        neuroethical nightmare scenarios of widespread brain scanning seem unlikely to come to
        pass, at least until radical advances make it far cheaper, much less invasive, far less
        sensitive to subtle perturbations, and with a much more robust ability to legitimately
        extrapolate from a finding about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to a prediction about an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. Where fMRI is
        concerned, ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúa penny</NUMEX> for your thoughts‚Äù is currently more like ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúa million pennies</NUMEX> for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-averaged hemodynamic response to highly constrained stimuli under entirely artificial
        conditions.‚Äù
        In light of this, bioethical concerns about fMRI applications should perhaps be viewed
        not as predictions of a certain future but rather as worstcase scenarios, a reminder of
        what we want to avoid. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s a funny thing about the bioethics field,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greely</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúThe
        general approach is to look for bad news.‚Äù
        While many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúworst cases‚Äù</ENAMEX> seem highly unlikely to come to pass, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Illes</ENAMEX>, of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics</ENAMEX>, thinks some action is warranted now, if only to
        generate a better understanding of the ethical dimensions of fMRI research. She notes that
        ‚Äúbioethicists are often viewed as the ethics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>,‚Äù but she doesn't see regulations as
        the right path to shape the future uses of fMRI. Instead, she thinks a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> of
        involved <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parties‚Äîscientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, ethicists, politicians‚Äîshould work together to
        develop guidelines that all will find acceptable. ‚ÄúI'm not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of stopping
        anything.‚Äù
        What everyone apparently already agrees on is the need for carefully designed
        experiments and cautious interpretation of the data. ‚ÄúA huge message in imaging is that you
        really have to look at the experimental setup at the common-sense level,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabrieli</ENAMEX>,
        and avoid the tendency to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúpick the most dramatic interpretation.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> needs to be
        reminded of the limitations of these findings,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> agrees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>. And as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langleben</ENAMEX> puts it,
        expressing his skepticism that there will ever be a one-size-fits-all, foolproof fMRI mind
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">reader: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúI don't think we'll ever be able to be stupid about it.‚Äù
