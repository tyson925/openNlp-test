        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> for treating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious disease</ENAMEX>. The most important chemical class of these
        antibiotics, apart from the penicillins, is the polyketides. They are made by the stepwise
        building of long carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> atoms at a time, by multifunctional enzymes that
        determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> length, oxidation <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and pattern of branching, cyclisation, and
        stereochemistry of the molecules in a combinatorial fashion to produce an enormous variety
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. Recent elucidation of the genetic â€˜programmingâ€™ of the enzymes has opened a
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery based on rationally engineering the enzymes to produce
        â€˜unnatural natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">productsâ</ENAMEX>€™ with novel properties.
        Following the development of penicillin for the treatment of septicemia in the early
        1940s, numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antibiotics</ENAMEX> were discovered and introduced into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. While a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>
        makes penicillin, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">semisynthetic</ENAMEX> derivatives of which have been a mainstay of antibacterial
        therapy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, most natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibacterial antibiotics</ENAMEX> come from a group of
        soil-dwelling, filamentous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> called the actinomycetes, of which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptomyces</ENAMEX> is the best-known genus. These organisms make an
        amazing array of so-called <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> metabolites that have evolved to give their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>
        a competitive advantage in the complex soil environment, where they are exposed to stresses
        of all kinds (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challis and Hopwood 2003</ENAMEX>). The compounds have many functions, but those with
        antibiotic activity are the most important from the human perspective. Actinomycete
        antibiotics include such antibacterial compounds as tetracycline and erythromycin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antifungal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> like candicidin and amphotericin, anticancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such as doxorubicin,
        and the antiparasitic avermectin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh 2003).</ENAMEX>
        While many different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are represented amongst actinomycete antibiotics,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> accounts for an extraordinary proportion of the important compounds, including
        all those mentioned above. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is made up of the polyketides. They are
        synthesized by multifunctional enzymes called polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are
        related to the fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid synthases</ENAMEX> that make the lipids essential for the integrity of
        cell membranes, but they carry out much more complex biosynthetic routines. Repeated rounds
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> building and modification use a series of independently variable reactions
        selected according to a â€˜programâ€™ characteristic of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reeves 2003).</ENAMEX> Recent research
        has focused on determining this program so as to be able to modify it in rational ways by
        genetic engineering and thus generate novel drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. The resulting field of
        â€˜combinatorial biosynthesisâ€™ of â€˜unnatural natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">productsâ</ENAMEX>€™ has been given added urgency
        by the rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRSA</ENAMEX> (methicillin-resistant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> ) is simply the most discussed of a series
        of threats (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh 2003).</ENAMEX> How do PKSs work and how can we make new ones?
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Diversity</ENAMEX>
        The heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> function is the synthesis of long chains of carbon atoms by joining
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">condensing</NUMEX>) together small organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, such as acetic and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">malonic acid</ENAMEX>, by a so-called
        ketosynthase function. This uses the building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the form of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX>,
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coenzyme A</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX>) esters, so we speak of acetyl-CoA and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">malonyl-CoA</ENAMEX>, for example. The
        special form of condensation that joins them is driven by loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>. Thus,
        when acetyl-CoA, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> carbon atoms, joins with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">malonyl-CoA</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> carbons, one of
        the latter is lost and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> carbon atoms results (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>). Further rounds of
        condensation extend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carbons</ENAMEX> at each step. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extender <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>,
        instead of being malonyl-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CoA</ENAMEX>, is methylmalonyl-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CoA</ENAMEX>, which has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> carbon atoms, the linear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is still extended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> carbons, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€˜extraâ€™ carbon</ENAMEX> forms a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> side
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch</ENAMEX>. More <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> extender <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> produce more complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side branches</ENAMEX>.
        Choices of the number and type of the building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are variables in determining
        polyketide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. Another concerns the keto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (C=<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>) that appear at every alternate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon atom</ENAMEX> in the growing chain as a result of the condensation process (accounting for
        the name polyketide). They may remain intact. Alternatively, some may be modified or
        removed by a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>), any of which may be omitted. This results
        in keto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> remaining at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> points in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hydroxyl groups (â€“OH</ENAMEX>), formed by
        reduction of a keto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, at others; double bonds between some adjacent carbon atoms,
        resulting from removal of the hydroxyl by loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (dehydration); or full saturation
        with hydrogen atoms elsewhere, arising by â€˜enoylâ€™ reduction of the double bond (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1C</NUMEX>).
        A further variable concerns the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX> or other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, each of which can exist in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible configurations. Finally, the
        nascent carbon chain adopts different folding patterns after it leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€˜tailoringâ€™ enzymes</ENAMEX> can then add sugars or other chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to it at many alternative
        positions, enabled by the pattern of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactivity</ENAMEX> built into the polyketide by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX>. The challenge has been to understand the programming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> that accounts for this
        gamut of structural variation.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, the ability to manipulate actinomycete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, developed over previous
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, mainly using the model species 
        Streptomyces coelicolor (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopwood 1999</ENAMEX>), was combined with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biochemical</ENAMEX> experiments to begin to crack this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜polyketide codeâ€™</ENAMEX>. The first
        studies were on organisms making antibiotics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€˜aromaticâ€™</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, which includes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetracycline</ENAMEX> and doxorubicin, as well as the model compounds actinorhodin (made by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> coelicolor itself) and tetracenomycin. The main variable in
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is carbon chain length, with few choices of different building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> modification, so the programming would (in principle) be simple. The DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> responsible for such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PKSs</ENAMEX> revealed sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX>, including
        ketosynthases, ketoreductases, and acyl carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (ACPs) (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> on
        which the growing carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> is tethered; see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>), that would come together to
        form a multicomponent PKS resembling a typical bacterial fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid synthase</ENAMEX>. In contrast,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequence of the gene set for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> polyketide erythromycin, made by a
        relative of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Streptomyces</ENAMEX> called 
        Saccharopolyspora erythraea , which has more involved
        programming, revealed multifunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the various enzymic functions carried
        out by active <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on the same polypeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, as in a mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fatty</ENAMEX> acid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX>.
        The big surprise, though, was the finding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> sets, or modules, of such active sites,
        corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> rounds of condensation needed to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cortes et</ENAMEX>
        al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donadio et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>). The modules each contain an acyl transferase (to load the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extender</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> onto the enzyme), as well as a ketosynthase and an ACP domain, together with
        exactly those reductive activities needed to generate the required pattern of modification
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> at each step of elongation. Thus was born an â€˜assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lineâ€™ model</ENAMEX> in which
        the program for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> is hardwired into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and expressed in a linear array of active
        sites (domains) along the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. This consists of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-building modules,
        preceded by a short module for loading the starter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> and ending in a domain for
        releasing the completed carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the polyketide would
        be assembled and modified progressively as the molecule moved along the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
        interacting with each domain in turn, which would select extender <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, make carbonâ€“carbon
        bonds, and modify keto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as appropriate, depending on the presence or absence of
        domains for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps in the reductive cycle.
        The model arose from the gene sequence, but was rapidly tested by mutating individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> or adding or deleting whole modules and by observing predicted changes in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyketide</ENAMEX> product. Soon, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> had been made, and the field
        mushroomed with the isolation of more and more clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for complex polyketides
        that both proved the generality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (with minor variations) and filled the need
        for spare parts for the engineering of countless new polyketides (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shen 2003).</ENAMEX> Several
        biotech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were founded to exploit the potential for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aromatic PKS Programming</ENAMEX>
        Meanwhile, the programming of the aromatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKSs</ENAMEX> was harder to understand. They had been
        found to contain only a single ketosynthase, which has to operate a specific number of
        times to build a carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the correct length, so how is this determined? How does a
        single reductive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> know which keto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to modify? And how is the starter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> for
        building the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> selected (the extender <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are normally all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">malonyl-CoA</ENAMEX>, so no
        choice is involved)? Considerable progress had been made in constructing novel compounds by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixing</ENAMEX> and matching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> subunits, but this was largely based on empirical knowledge about
        which components to put together (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDaniel et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>). A specific subunit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX>,
        named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> length factor (CLF), was deduced to have a major influence on carbon chain
        length (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDaniel et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>), but this conclusion was not universally accepted in the
        absence of experimental evidence on its mode of action. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent publications by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khosla</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> describe significant advances in understanding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aromatic</ENAMEX> PKS programming and promise to turn the spotlight back onto engineered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        this class of compounds as potential drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> by allowing rational manipulation of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key variables: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> chain length and choice of starter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
        In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> explore the hypothesis that the CLF
        exerts control over carbon chain length by associating closely with the ketosynthase, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with which it shares considerable amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> sequence similarity, giving rise to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> of a certain size at the interface between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. By systematically
        changing amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> key positions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLF</ENAMEX>, the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> was altered.
        Thus, large amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLF</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> that makes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> were
        replaced by less bulky <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> found in one that builds a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, and the chain
        length of the product increased as expected. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> propose that the length of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> is the main factor in controlling the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extension steps that can take
        place to fill it. While proteinâ€“protein interactions with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX> subunits may modulate
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> length control, the work represents a major step in understanding and
        manipulating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> length of aromatic polyketides.
        What about the choice of starter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>? Most aromatic polyketides start with acetyl-CoA.
        An important earlier publication by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leadlay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bisang et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) had shown
        that this is not loaded directly onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKS</ENAMEX>, as had been assumed, but is derived by loss
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> from a molecule of malonyl-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> previously loaded onto the enzyme. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decarboxylation</ENAMEX> is catalysed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLF</ENAMEX> as an activity independent of its role in
        influencing carbon chain length. There are, however, certain aromatic polyketides,
        including the anticancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doxorubicin</ENAMEX>, an antiparasitic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> called frenolicin, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor agonist R1128</ENAMEX>, that have different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">starters</ENAMEX>.
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>) have deduced, as described in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PloS Biology</ENAMEX> , is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKSs</ENAMEX> for these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        modules of active sites. The components of each module are not activities carried on the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKSs</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> polyketides, but are all separate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        They form functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modules</ENAMEX> nevertheless. The newly recognized modules in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of
        compounds that start with nonacetate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> have a dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACP</ENAMEX> and a special ketosynthase
        that carries out a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> condensation, joining the unusual starter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> to the first
        malonyl-CoA extender <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. The starter module then hands the resulting â€˜diketideâ€™ on to the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> module (first reducing it, if appropriate, using reductive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">enzymes â€˜borrowedâ€™</ENAMEX> from
        fatty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid biosynthesis</ENAMEX>) for typical extension by successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">condensation</ENAMEX> with malonyl-CoA
        units to complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. If the starter module is not present, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> module
        defaults to its typical habit of decarboxylating malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and starts the
        chain with that.
        The excitement of the work for biotechnology is that it offers the prospect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> promising drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> by making novel combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">starter</ENAMEX> and extender
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modules</ENAMEX> and perhaps of feeding the starter modules with a whole range of unnatural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalaitzis et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). It is encouraging that already, in the
        proof-of-principle studies reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), some products with improved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitro</ENAMEX> antitumor activity were obtained.
