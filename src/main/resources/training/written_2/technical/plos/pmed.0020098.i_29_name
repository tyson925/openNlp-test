        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Detect Very Early Atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treat Aggressively</ENAMEX>
        Atherosclerotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular disease</ENAMEX> is the greatest cause of death and disability in
        developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. The best way to prevent these outcomes is to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> at the
        earliest possible stage and to attack it with pinpoint-targeted aggressive treatment.
        B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> to measure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intima-media</ENAMEX> thickness (IMT)
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) is the most effective way to do that.
        It is time to end the mindset that thinks of atherosclerosis as an inevitable function
        of aging. It is not: it is a disease, whether it causes an acute event or gradual decline.
        As with any disease, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and more intensively we attack it‚Äîwith <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> and
        lifestyle changes‚Äîthe more successful we will be in containing and reversing it.
        Ultrasonography of the carotid to detect plaque and increased intimal wall thickness is the
        best, safest, and easiest early detector we have.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> at risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> are identifiable only up to
        a point using traditional methods, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> risk score [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], the European
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCORE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> level [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. These
        are particularly effective for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the highest risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, but they have serious
        flaws. They do not take family history of premature coronary artery disease into account;
        they do not benefit from new assays that can differentiate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipoproteins</ENAMEX> by particle size
        and number, both of which are important factors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">atherogenicity</TIMEX>; and they do not include
        the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s diet, abdominal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> content, racial and ethnic genetic
        differences, confounding medical conditions, certain gender differences, and other factors.
        Thus, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> deemed ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù for acute events within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of time</TIMEX> might still
        develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        All of the current risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were developed within the obsolete gestalt of life spans
        of perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 to 70 years</TIMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are now increasingly living productively into
        their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80s and 90s</TIMEX>. Risk tables are based only on cardiac events over a relatively short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>. Progress in medical science is now on the steepest slope of
        exponential growth. It is reasonable to expect that those who maintain healthy circulation
        will experience good quality life beyond the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100-year</TIMEX> mark in the surprisingly near future,
        and perhaps to 120 years not long after. Furthermore, risk escalates with age. Thus, an
        initial low risk profile becomes far more significant when considered in the context of
        long lives. Equally important, gradual impairment of blood flow that nourishes tissues can
        lead to peripheral vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, increased susceptibility to infection, cognitive
        decline, frailty, and other changes that impair life quality and longevity.
        While risk factors help individualize treatment, they do not address the most critical
        issue: identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> at the very earliest stage to try to stop and reverse
        the process 
        before any damage has occurred. Risk factors identify those who 
        might develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsmoking gun‚</ENAMEX>Äù is to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> when it
        actually <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> develops. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> begins as a lipid and inflammatory cell deposition
        in the intimal subendothelial space, which expands outward, with only a slight inward
        intrusion on the lumen. This does not affect blood flow unless the lumen-side plaque cap
        ruptures, and a clot forms and expands into the blood stream. Most clots are limited by
        thrombolytic mechanisms, but significant blockage usually results as the clot is scarred
        over. Some clots expand all the way across to the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, completely
        occluding it, causing a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Thus, if we could discover plaque at the very earliest stage, we could aggressively
        attack it with our full armamentarium of lifestyle modification, addressing all the factors
        noted above, and medications‚Äîstatins, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ACE inhibitors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aspirin</ENAMEX>, niacin, ezetimibe, and
        others‚Äîto stabilize and then reverse the process before a rupture occurs. The REVERSAL
        trial, among many others, has shown that atherosclerosis is reversible with aggressive
        treatment [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Carotid ultrasound is an easy, safe, noninvasive method for detecting early,
        focal plaques and early thickening of the inner lining of the artery [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. There is ample
        evidence that this is an effective and reproducible detector, and a predictor of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> and symptomatic disease [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In contrast, angiography is invasive and is
        insensitive to early changes in the artery wall thickness. Magnetic resonance imaging is
        expensive, cumbersome, and still experimental. Calcium scoring by computed tomography is
        less sensitive and less reproducible and suggests plaque presence only indirectly [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angiography</ENAMEX> and calcium scoring entail considerable <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> ray exposure.
        Using high-sensitivity carotid ultrasound as a primary screening tool would add modest
        cost, but that would be more than offset by sharply reducing the enormous worldwide toll of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX>. Screening tests should be easy, affordable, widely available, and
        predictive. Carotid ultrasound meets all these criteria and should be used to screen
        everyone early on who is at any increased risk by measure of the expanded risk factors
        noted above.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Makover</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Response to Ebrahim's Viewpoint</ENAMEX>
        While the ‚Äúpopulation‚Äù approach is obviously very important, there is no reason not to
        use the ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù approach as well. ‚ÄúHigh risk‚Äù is the wrong term‚Äî
        all arteries matter over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 120-year</TIMEX> life span. We must attack
        atherosclerosis at the very onset, not wait until it is ‚Äúhigh risk.‚Äù All previous
        approaches were designed to detect those at allegedly higher risk by various criteria. This
        misses the point. Once plaque exists, risk exists, especially when viewed over a full
        lifetime, not the current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year</TIMEX> standard. And although the aggressive approach I
        outlined in my viewpoint would obviously have a cost, the savings (a reduction in the
        financial toll of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX>) would be greater than the cost.
        Ultrasonography of the carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery intimal wall</ENAMEX> is effective and highly predictive
        according to the great preponderance of studies [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ebrahim</ENAMEX> cites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies to support
        his argument that measuring carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMT</ENAMEX> offers no additional predictive power over
        conventional screening tools [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,19</NUMEX>], but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these has serious flaws (such as a
        significant dropout rate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> assumed was random, a short follow-up period, and
        the inclusion only of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of an advanced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>) [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], and the other concluded that carotid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IMT</ENAMEX> measurement ‚Äúsubstantially improved prediction of future coronary heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disease‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are at risk now and cannot wait for endless studies to prove over and
        over what we already know. It is not ‚Äúna√Øve‚Äù for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to want to remain well and to
        maintain their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> to enable healthy older lives. Nor should we disparage as ‚Äúworried‚Äù
        the very human desire to remain that way. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>-wide planning is important, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> take care of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. Carotid ultrasonography is by far the
        best way to design treatment for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> exactly as needed. I believe that there is
        already sufficient evidence and sensible rationale to meld already well-proven technologies
        and approaches into a comprehensive, aggressive attack on atherosclerosis.
