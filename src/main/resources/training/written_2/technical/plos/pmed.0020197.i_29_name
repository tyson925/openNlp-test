        A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-y</NUMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> presented with pulmonary embolism. She had been taking, without
        apparent complication, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">norgestimate</ENAMEX>/ethynil estradiol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ortho Tri-Cyclen</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.180</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.215</NUMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.250</NUMEX> mg norgestimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 μg</NUMEX> ethinyl estradiol) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 y</TIMEX>, followed by the same
        drug combination but with a lower dose of ethinyl estradiol (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> μg
        ethinyl estradiol) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> mo. A nonsmoker, she lacked a relevant family history and was
        vigorously athletic.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One month</TIMEX> prior to presentation, she developed neck pain; disc protrusion at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">C5-C6</TIMEX> was
        detected by magnetic resonance imaging. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was prescribed valdecoxib, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mg twice
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> (b.i.d.), for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> wk. Her neck pain resolved. However, towards the end of this
        treatment period, she developed left-sided pleuritic chest and shoulder pain after a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-h
        car ride. She was started on cyclobenzaprine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mg b.i.d.</ENAMEX>, and continued on valdecoxib.
        Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">left-</ENAMEX>sided pain abated gradually. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> d later, she developed right-sided chest
        and shoulder pain. A diagnosis of left iliac vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary emboli
        was based on a computed tomography scan. She was heparinized and continued on therapy with
        warfarin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mg b.i.d.</ENAMEX>, and enoxaparin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mg b.i.d. Despite this, a ventilation-perfusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scan</ENAMEX> performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> d later showed multiple pulmonary emboli (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Currently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is on warfarin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> mg <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, while completing a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-mo</NUMEX> warfarin
        regimen. Her warfarin is well tolerated and otherwise the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is in good health.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISCUSSION</ENAMEX>
        Coxibs, selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of cyclooxygenase-2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX>), increase the risk of
        myocardial infarction and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1–3</NUMEX>], prompting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with established
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX>. Caution may also extend to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> predisposed to thrombosis by
        genetic or environmental factors.
        Risk factors for spontaneous thrombosis include oral contraceptives, genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposition</ENAMEX> to a hypercoaguable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and prolonged periods of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stasis</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4–6</NUMEX>]. At least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> risk factors pertained to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had been taking oral contraceptives for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">y</ENAMEX> prior to the index event, albeit
        without recognized thrombotic complication. It is possible that despite this extended
        period of apparent tolerance, the embolic events were solely related to use of the oral
        contraceptives [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        The relatively small risk of venous thromboembolism attributable to oral contraceptive
        use may interact geometrically with the similarly small absolute risk of a procoagulant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutation</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Factor V Leiden</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. However, documented genetic risk factors, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in lupus anticoagulant, anti-thrombin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, plasma
        homocysteine, anticardiolipin, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β2</NUMEX> glycoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, and prothrombotic mutations in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Factor V</ENAMEX> and prothrombin were excluded. It remains possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was
        genetically predisposed to thrombosis by a mutation in an undetermined factor.
        Finally, prolonged stasis, such as that which occurred during the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-h <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> trip, may
        account for the clinical event [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. However, the absolute risk is small, and the patient
        had made this trip on multiple occasions devoid of apparent clinical complications during
        the prior <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 y.</ENAMEX>
        The risk of thrombosis from valdecoxib has now been established [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,7</NUMEX>], and this,
        together with its propensity rarely to cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> syndrome without a mitigating
        benefit over traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, has led to its withdrawal
        from the market
        . The cardiovascular hazard of coxibs appears likely to be attributable
        to the suppression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-derived prostacyclin [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,8</NUMEX>]. Deletion of the prostacyclin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> does not cause spontaneous thrombosis, but rather enhances the response to
        thrombotic stimuli [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. This is consistent with the fact that a cardiovascular signal from
        a coxib is most easily detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with hemostatic activation, such as was
        observed under placebo-controlled conditions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trials in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing
        cardiopulmonary bypass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grafting</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] and anecdotally in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with connective tissue
        disease [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        Although this case does not establish a causative linkage with valdecoxib, the clinical
        event was not manifest until <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> potential risk factors were combined (oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraceptives</ENAMEX>, prolonged stasis, and coxib treatment). Given the multiplicative
        interactions of risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thromboembolic disease</ENAMEX> and the apparently untoward
        concurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">them—the contraceptive pill</ENAMEX> and frequent road trips for the preceding
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> y—the rapid occurrence of the clinical event following initiation of the coxib suggests a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causative</ENAMEX> link to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COX-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inhibitor</ENAMEX>. However, it also remains formally possible that this
        temporal relationship was a coincidence.
        This case report has been reported to the regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and to the manufacturer
        of valdecoxib.
        Just as the small absolute risks of thrombosis attributable to oral contraceptives and
        prothrombotic mutations may interact dramatically [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COX-2</ENAMEX> may
        also interact with genetic and environmental factors that predispose to the risk of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombosis</ENAMEX>.
