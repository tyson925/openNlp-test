        history. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josef Mengele</ENAMEX>, infamous for his work at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX>, was fascinated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX>. He sought them out at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">extermination camp</ENAMEX> and used them in violent experiments.
        Later, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyril Burt</ENAMEX> worked on the heredity of intelligence, producing
        findings that some suspected were ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Äútoo good‚Äù‚Äîand</ENAMEX> which later were shown to be based on
        fraudulent data involving invented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Krieger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> examine the health of female
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX> from a very different perspective. To understand the impact of lifetime socioeconomic
        position on health, they studied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> who were raised together but who had different
        socioeconomic position after adolescence. Many studies have compared the health of twins
        raised separately since birth or early childhood, but few have investigated the adult
        health of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> raised together but who had different post-adolescent socioeconomic
        position. Such a study could clarify the impact of adult experiences on adult health in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> matched on early life experiences, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> say.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krieger</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> employed data from a cohort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">434</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> who lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1978‚Äì1979</NUMEX>; the average age at recruitment was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41 years old</TIMEX>. The cohort was
        given a health and sociodemographic questionnaire. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on anthropometric and biological
        characteristics were obtained by physical examination and laboratory analyses; the process
        was repeated at a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> examination around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1989‚Äì1990</NUMEX>. At the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase of the study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3%</NUMEX>) did not return, of whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> had died, which left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">352</NUMEX> twin pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>
        monozygotic, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> dizygotic), representing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81.1%</NUMEX> of the original cohort.
        The sociodemographic and health characteristics of the full cohort (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">352</NUMEX> pairs) and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cohort</ENAMEX> analyzed (those pairs where it was known both that they had lived together until at
        least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX> and their joint socioeconomic was available‚Äîi.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">308</NUMEX> pairs) were quite
        similar: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> grew up in working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had
        fewer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> of college education.
        At the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> examination, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> of the twin pairs in the analytic cohort had a difference
        in their adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household occupational class</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> had different levels of college
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> found that health outcomes among monozygotic adult female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> who
        lived together through childhood varied by their subsequent socioeconomic position. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twins</ENAMEX>
        with differing occupational class differed in health status compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> with
        similar occupational class. The working-class twin had significantly higher systolic blood
        pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LDL cholesterol</ENAMEX> than her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professional</ENAMEX>,
        non-working-class twin. Twins discordant on educational level, however, had similar health
        status, likely reflecting the fact that current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occupational class</ENAMEX> is a better measure for
        investigating the impact of lifetime socioeconomic position than is education (which is
        completed usually in early adulthood). Dizgyotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> with differing adult socioeconomic
        position, either occupational class or educational level, did not notably differ in their
        adult health status.
        These novel findings lend support to the hypothesis that health is shaped not only by
        early life experiences but also by cumulative experiences across the lifecourse, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> say.
        As with many twin studies, the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> studied is relatively limited. The
        lack of some biological and personal data such as detailed occupational class position over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, lack of data on income, poverty, wealth, debt, gestational age, birthweight, and
        birth order also limits the conclusions that can be drawn. These limitations are countered,
        however, by the tight matching of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> on early life and childhood exposures, as well
        as by the matching for genetic endowment among the monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>. Together, the
        findings have important implications for health policy, since they suggest that adult
        socioeconomic position does have an impact on adult health above and beyond early life
        exposures, and they also add to our understanding of how societal conditions shape
        population patterns of health, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and well-being.
