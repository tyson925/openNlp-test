        This could explain results of previous studies that have shown a link between short sleep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duration</ENAMEX> and high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>). But a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emmanuel Mignot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        suggests that it's not just the additional snacking opportunities that make short sleepers
        more likely to be overweight.
        Intrigued by the connection between sleep and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and by recent studies showing that
        sleep deprivation in laboratory settings can cause a decrease in serum levels of leptin, a
        hormone known to control appetite, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emmanuel Mignot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> set out to study the
        levels of various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> known to regulate appetite and energy expenditure under “real
        life” conditions.
        They took advantage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study</ENAMEX>, an ongoing longitudinal study
        of sleep habits and disorders in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The study began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> mailed state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30–60 years</TIMEX> a survey on sleep habits, health, and
        demographics. Mail surveys were repeated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> intervals, and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
        were recruited to sleep a night in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and undergo various tests. A number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were also asked to keep a sleep diary for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 days</TIMEX>. The study has already shown
        connections between sleep apnea and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>, and between menopause and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sleep-disordered</ENAMEX> breathing.
        For their study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mignot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> measured sleep duration (habitual and immediately
        prior to blood sampling), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and pre-breakfast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood hormone</ENAMEX> levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,024</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. Consistent with previous studies, they found that in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who sleep
        less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was inversely proportional to sleep
        duration. In addition, short sleep was associated with low leptin and high ghrelin levels
        (ghrelin is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> thought to stimulate food intake).These hormonal differences are
        likely to increase appetite, which could be responsible for the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> in short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sleepers</ENAMEX>.
        These findings could explain, at least in part, why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> in which excess calories
        are much easier to come by than a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>'s sleep are more prone to obesity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mignot</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> plan to test this in intervention studies where they make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sleep more and
        measure the effects on body mass. “Good sleep, healthy eating habits, and regular exercise
        each may have important roles in fighting obesity in modern society,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">”</ENAMEX> suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mignot</ENAMEX>.
