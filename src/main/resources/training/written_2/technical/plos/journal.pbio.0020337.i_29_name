        soon become aware that the ear makes its own distinctive sounds. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whistling</ENAMEX>, buzzing,
        hissing, perhaps a chiming chorus of many tones—such continuous sounds seem remarkably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonbiological</ENAMEX> to my perception, more in the realm of the electronic.
        Even more remarkable, put a sensitive microphone in the ear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> and you will usually
        pick up an objective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> of that subjective experience. Now known in auditory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> as spontaneous otoacoustic emission, the sound registered by the microphone is a
        clear message that the cochlea uses active processes to detect the phenomenally faint
        sounds—measured in micropascals—that our ears routinely hear. If the ear were more
        sensitive, we would need to contend with the sound of air molecules raining upon our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eardrums</ENAMEX>.
        What is that process—the mechanical or electrical scheme that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hallowell Davis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>
        called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‘cochlear amplifier’</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1983)—which</ENAMEX> energises the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX>-sized hearing organ
        buried in the solid bone of our skull?
        That question has engaged my curiosity since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> auditory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physicist David Kemp</ENAMEX> first put a microphone to an ear and discovered the telltale sounds of
        the cochlea at work (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp 1978).</ENAMEX> Siren-like, the sounds have drawn me into the theory and
        experiment of cochlear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, now as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">PhD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian National</ENAMEX>
        University in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canberra</ENAMEX>. I am studying the micromechanics of this process from a theoretical
        point of view, and investigating whether a resonance picture of some kind can be applied to
        the faint but mysterious sounds most cochleas emit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX>'s discoveries are rightly viewed as opening a fresh path to auditory science, and
        to the tools and techniques for diagnosing the functional status of the cochlea. But in
        terms of fundamental understanding, a key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> remains that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas Gold</ENAMEX> more than half
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century ago</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold 1948</ENAMEX>). Still cited widely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> deals with the basic
        question of how the cochlea works to analyse sound into its component frequencies. Two
        prominent theories—sympathetic resonance, proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hermann Helmholtz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>), and
        travelling waves, proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georg von Békésy</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>)—need to be distinguished (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        In a nutshell, are there tiny, independently tuned elements in the cochlea, like the
        discrete strings of a piano, that are set into sympathetic vibration by incoming sound
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helmholtz</ENAMEX>), or is the continuously graded sensing surface of the cochlea hydrodynamically
        coupled so that, like flicking a rope, motion of the eardrum and middle ear bones causes a
        travelling wave to sweep from one end towards the other (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Békésy</ENAMEX>)?
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> option, sympathetic resonance, has the advantage of allowing vanishingly small
        energies to build up, cycle by cycle, into an appreciable motion—like boosting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> on a
        swing. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, travelling wave, has the weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Békésy</ENAMEX>'s extensive experiments
        behind it. At the same time, one of the drawbacks of the travelling wave theory is the
        difficulty of accounting for the ear's exquisite fine tuning: trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> can easily
        detect tuning differences of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 0.2%</NUMEX>. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Békésy</ENAMEX> himself notes, on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX> of
        his classic book, that ‘the resonance theory of hearing is probably the most elegant of all
        theories of hearing’.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX>'s work, done in collaboration with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJ Pumphrey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pumphrey 1948</ENAMEX>), was the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to consider that the ear cannot act passively, as both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helmholtz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Békésy</ENAMEX> had
        thought, but must be an active detector. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> who had done wartime work on
        radar, and he brought his signal-processing knowledge to bear on how the cochlea works. He
        knew that, to preserve signal-to-noise ratio, a signal had to be amplified before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detector</ENAMEX>, and that ‘surely nature can't be as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid</ENAMEX> as to go and put a nerve fibre—that is
        a detector—right at the front end of the sensitivity of the system’. He therefore proposed
        that the ear operated like a regenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX>, much like some radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">receivers</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> that used positive feedback to amplify a signal before it was detected. Regenerative
        receivers were simple—one could be built with a single vacuum tube—and they provided high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and narrow bandwidth. A drawback, however, was that, if provoked, the circuit
        could ‘take off’, producing an unwanted whistle. Gold connected this with the perception of
        ringing in the ear (tinnitus), and daringly suggested that if a microphone were put next to
        the ear, a corresponding sound might be picked up. He experimented, placing a microphone in
        his ear after inducing temporary tinnitus with overly loud sound. The technology wasn't up
        to the job—in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> microphones weren't sensitive enough—and the experiment, sadly,
        failed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX>'s pioneering work is now acknowledged to be a harbinger of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX>'s discoveries. But
        there is one aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>'s paper that is not so widely considered: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>'s experiments
        led him to favour a resonance theory of hearing. In fact, the abstract of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> paper
        declares that ‘previous theories of hearing are considered, and it is shown that only the
        resonance theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helmholtz…</ENAMEX> is consistent with observation’.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pumphrey</ENAMEX> did psychophysical experiments in which hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thresholds</ENAMEX> were
        determined for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> first for continuous pure tones and then for increasingly briefer
        stimuli of the same frequency. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pumphrey</ENAMEX> showed that their results could only be
        accounted for by considering the cochlea as a set of resonators, each of which responds to
        a narrow frequency range.
        In a second neat experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX> had to detect differences between the sound of
        repetitive tone pips (series <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) and those same stimuli but with the phase of every second
        pip inverted (series <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, in which compressions replaced rarefactions and vice versa).
        Out-of-phase pips should counteract the action of in-phase pips and, following the
        child-on-swing analogy, rapidly bring swinging to a halt. Therefore, the argument goes, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> series should sound different. By increasing the silent interval between pips until the
        difference disappeared, the experimenters could infer how long the vibrations (or swinging)
        appeared to persist and could then put a measure on the quality factor 
        (Q), or narrowness in frequency range, of the presumed underlying
        resonance.
        From the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiment, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pumphrey</ENAMEX> derived values of 
        Q of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 to 300</TIMEX>, meaning that the range of response was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as little as</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/300</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> of the imposed frequency—based on the picture of a broad travelling wave. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> experiment gave comparable results. However, their resonance interpretation has been
        dismissed because of a methodological flaw in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> experiment: the spectral
        signatures of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> series are not the same and provide additional cues. Nevertheless, it
        is not widely appreciated that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> experiment seems methodologically sound, and its
        results remain persuasive.
        I think the resonance theory deserves reconsideration. The evidence of my ears tells me
        that the cochlea is very highly tuned, and an active resonance theory of some sort seems to
        provide the most satisfying explanation. Furthermore, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>'s neglected
        experiment, we now know from studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acoustic</ENAMEX> emissions that the relative bandwidth of
        spontaneously emitted sound from the cochlea can be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/1000</NUMEX> of the emission's frequency, or
        less. My research, guided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Professors M. V. Srinivasan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. H. Fletcher</ENAMEX>, has centred on
        finding an answer to that most fundamental question: if the cochlea is resonating, what are
        the resonant elements?
        A point of inspiration for me is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>'s later discussion of cochlear function (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>)—some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX>'s discoveries had been made. Gold draws a striking analogy
        for the problem confronting the cochlea, whose resonant elements—whatever they are—sit
        immersed in fluid (the aqueous lymph that fills the organ). To make these elements resonate
        is difficult, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>, because they are damped by surrounding fluid, just like the
        strings of a piano submerged in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> would be. He concludes that, to make ‘an underwater
        piano’ work, we would have to add sensors and actuators to every string so that once a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">string</ENAMEX> is sounded the damping is counteracted by positive feedback. ‘If we now supplied
        each string with a correctly designed feedback circuit,’ he surmises, ‘then the underwater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">piano</ENAMEX> would work again.’
        My research is investigating what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>'s underwater piano strings might be. A suggestion
        put forward in a recent paper (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fletcher 2004)</ENAMEX> is that resonance might occur in the
        space between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cochlea</ENAMEX>'s geometrically arranged rows of outer hair cells. These cells
        are both effectors (they change length when stimulated) and sensors (their stereocilia
        detect minute displacements), so a positive feedback <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> can form that sets up
        resonance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between one row</TIMEX> of cells and its neighbour. The key is to transmit the feedback
        with the correct phase delay, and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> describes how this can be done using
        ‘squirting waves’ in the gap occupied by the outer hair cell stereocilia. The paper
        suggests that the outer hair cells create a standing wave resonance, from which energy is
        delivered to inner <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neural transduction</ENAMEX> takes place). In this way, the
        input signal is amplified before it is detected—an active system functioning just like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX>'s regenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX>.
        With a prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> in place for the resonating elements, this should, I think,
        prompt us to re-evaluate resonance theories of hearing, which were first put forward by the
        ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> and which, irrepressibly, keep resurfacing. The best-known resonance theory
        was that formulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmholtz</ENAMEX>, but at that time no satisfactory resonating elements
        could be identified, and it lapsed until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>'s attempt to revive it. There are other
        difficulties in reviving a resonance theory of hearing, but I think they can be
        overcome.
        If there really are resonant elements in the ear, the outstanding question would be, how
        are they stimulated? It is conceivable that motion of the conventional travelling wave sets
        them off, in which case we have an interesting hybrid of travelling wave and resonance. The
        other possibility, which I favour, is that outer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> are stimulated by the fast
        pressure wave that sweeps through all of the cochlear fluid at the speed of sound in water
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> m/s). If that is the case, and outer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> are primarily pressure sensors, not
        displacement detectors, then the ear is a fully resonant, pressure-driven system. New life,
        perhaps, to that old resonance idea.
