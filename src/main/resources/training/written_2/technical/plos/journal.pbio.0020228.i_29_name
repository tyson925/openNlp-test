              implications of open-access publishing for established publishing practices and
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in scientific and medical research.
            
          
        
        The questions, tensions, and social concerns surrounding copyright and the Internet are
        very different for scientific and medical literature than for other kinds of easily
        reproducible digital works. Peer-reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> are often the sole tangible products
        of the tremendously time-consuming and expensive process of conducting primary research in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">biology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. Who should own the primary research articles that are the culmination
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and staggering financial investments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, and tax-exempt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>? What uses should the documents' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>
        permit?
        In practice, academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> typically assign full copyrights to their articles to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> in which the works appear. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> do not benefit financially
        from the transaction; indeed, they often subsidize the cost of their articles' publication
        in the form of page charges, color charges, and other fees levied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>. The
        prestige associated with publishing in a selective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> is sufficiently valuable that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> are generally willing to abdicate the legal rights to their own work without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remuneration</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, however, several technological and legal innovations have led a growing
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to begin to question the sagacity of this arrangement. The advent of
        electronic publishing and the Internet itself have made technically possible a slew of
        novel uses of primary research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. Simultaneously, the traditional ‚Äúall rights
        reserved‚Äù copyright license has been supplemented by a variety of alternative licenses‚Äîof
        equal legal validity and available at no charge to anyone who wants them‚Äîthat allow
        copyright <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> to prevent some uses of a work without permission, but to authorize
        others. Different licenses created by the nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Commons</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creativecommons</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), for example, allow copyright <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> to mark their work with
        freedoms‚Äîto permit a work's reproduction for any noncommercial purpose (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noncommercial</ENAMEX>
        License) or for any purpose at all provided that the original authorship is properly
        attributed (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attribution License</ENAMEX>).
        The upshot of these developments is that copyright <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> can now permit a spectrum of
        uses of a paper by prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, anthologizers, archivists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, and other interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. Precisely which uses are
        permitted and which are not is far from a trivial matter. The particular copyright license
        under which an article is published largely determines how the document can be stored,
        searched, and built upon by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rights and Users' Rights</ENAMEX>
        One implication of the variety of copyright licenses now widely available is that the
        right to use an article in one way or another is largely independent of its accessibility
        online. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> that is touted as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúfreely available‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfree access‚Äù is very different
        from one that is ‚Äúopen access.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">See http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plos</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/openaccess</ENAMEX> for the formal
        definition of an open-access article, drafted at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 April 2003</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bethesda Meeting on Open</ENAMEX>
        Access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publishing</ENAMEX>.) When a document is ‚Äúfreely available,‚Äù someone who comes across it may
        be permitted to do nothing more than read it online on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s Web site; the right to
        use the article in any other way is typically granted only at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX>'s discretion.
        When a document is open access, however, a wide range of additional uses are perpetually
        and irrevocably allowed‚Äî from the reproduction and distribution of the paper by a professor
        for his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> to the archiving of the paper in a searchable online repository
        available to anyone in the world with an Internet connection, and more.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Commons Attribution License</ENAMEX> (CCAL), which governs this editorial and all
        other content in 
        PLoS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biology</ENAMEX> , permits a number of uses of articles that are typically
        restricted and for which there is an immediate demand. All articles published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> can
        be included in coursepacks‚Äîa use-right that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> would want to allow without
        exception, but that most traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> grant only for a substantial fee (which
        they rarely share with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAL</ENAMEX> also ensures that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are permitted to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archive</ENAMEX> not only articles written by their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>, but all other works published under
        the same legal terms as well, thereby facilitating their permanent accessibility and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preservation</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LOCKSS (‚ÄúLots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe‚Äù</ENAMEX>) program
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://lockss.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stanford</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/projectdescbrief.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">htm</ENAMEX>), an ongoing project to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>'
        efforts to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúcreate, preserve, and archive local electronic collections,‚Äù is viable only
        insofar as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> are permitted to store information themselves, rather than access
        it exclusively via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>' Web sites. Many collaborative projects between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publishers</ENAMEX> have been complicated by legal constraints, including the stipulation that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">archives remain ‚Äúdark,‚Äù</ENAMEX> or inaccessible to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, until any commercial incentive for
        restricting access to articles has been exhausted‚Äîclearly a suboptimal arrangement for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, and one that is unnecessary for collections of works governed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAL</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the truly revolutionary implications of open-access articles, however, is that we
        simply do not know the full range of their potential applications. They are available for
        any use that any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> can envision, so long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> are
        properly credited. The only certainty, then, is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of open-access research
        articles will be limited solely by the imagination of those that are inspired by the
        possibilities‚Äîrather than by legal constraints.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' Protections
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX> retain the copyright to all articles in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> and license their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">works</ENAMEX> under nonexclusive terms that
        reserve only some‚Äîrather than all‚Äîrights. There are several common objections, generally
        leveled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX>, against this practice. For example, it is sometimes argued that the
        traditional copyright arrangement in scientific publishing protects against uses of
        articles that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> would object to‚Äîwhile the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CCAL</ENAMEX> permits such uses and renders <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        helpless to prevent them.
        To the extent that the uses in question are for academic or archival purposes, such as
        those discussed above, it is certainly true that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">CCAL</ENAMEX> permits practices that ‚Äúall
        rights reserved‚Äù licenses do not. Indeed, the expanded range of legitimate academic uses of
        articles is among the primary selling points of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCAL</ENAMEX> in the context of scientific
        publishing. To the extent that the ostensibly objectionable uses are commercial, the
        problem is easily remedied with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Commons Noncommercial License</ENAMEX>, which prohibits
        commercial reuse of a work without the copyright <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX>'s consent.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> has chosen, for reasons both philosophical and pragmatic, to permit the commercial
        use of works we publish. As a matter of principle, all of our policies reflect the view
        that scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> are service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and should not themselves restrict the
        potential applications of the largely publicly funded work in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. More
        concretely, if a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> is interested in repackaging the articles that PLoS
        has published, we are loath to prevent an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s work from wider distribution. Any risk
        that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will use an article for a purpose its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> would be uncomfortable with is,
        in our view, substantially outweighed by the benefits of allowing‚Äînot on a case-by-case
        basis, but across the board‚Äîthe reproduction of the article for inclusion in online
        encyclopedias, or for distribution in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in which Internet access is unreliable, or,
        indeed, for creative uses we hope to inspire by making primary research articles legally
        available to commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX>.
        Another recurring objection to the copyright arrangement that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> employs is that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> are inappropriate copyright <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> because they are ill-equipped to protect their
        own works against plagiarism, misattribution, and other misuse. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, however,
        have enough familiarity with cases of plagiarism in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> to know that their
        strongest protection against mis- or nonattribution is derived not from the threat of
        prosecution for copyright infringement, but from community standards of conduct.
        Furthermore, among the benefits of open-access articles is the fact that their full texts,
        rather than just their abstracts, are searchable‚Äîwhich, as any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> knows, makes
        plagiarism much easier to detect.
        Beyond plagiarism and misattribution, it is not clear what uses of primary research
        articles <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> would actually want to prevent (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">other than</ENAMEX>, perhaps, the commercial uses
        that their work is already susceptible to, in many cases, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> hold copyrights).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> do not receive royalties for their published work. The more widely their
        articles are read and cited, the more their professional reputations are bolstered.
        Certainly, research articles have a wide range of uses that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> typically object to‚Äî
        and indeed often file suit over‚Äîsuch as their compilation in coursepacks by copy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
        Those applications, however, tend not to constitute ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' eyes.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice</ENAMEX>
        There is no question that the licensing arrangement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> employs is relatively novel‚Äîand
        therefore untested over the long term‚Äîin biomedical publishing. However, it hardly takes a
        radical understanding of the interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of primary research articles to
        conclude that the open-access terms of copyright promise substantial benefits for both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        What, then, can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> do to encourage other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> to follow suit and strike
        similar legal arrangements with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> as a matter of course? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> answer is to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúvote with
        your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">submissions;‚Äù</ENAMEX> that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> should submit their work preferentially to journals
        with copyright and licensing practices that genuinely serve their interests. Another
        equally important action for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> is to raise the issue with their professional
        societies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scholarly associations</ENAMEX> exist, among other reasons, to serve the needs of their
        members‚Äîand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society members</ENAMEX> should actively urge their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society journals</ENAMEX> to employ the CCAL
        or a similar license for their research articles.
        Scientific and medical literature is different from fiction or movies or music. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> invests <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $28 billion</NUMEX> per year in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> alone to fund research in biology and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> who conduct that
        research and the research paid for by other public-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        and abroad have an affirmative moral obligation to share the knowledge they create‚Äînot just
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> at elite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>, but with everyone who could use it
        and build upon it. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> publish their work in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> with restrictive copyright
        practices, it becomes illegal (often for even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> themselves) to store primary
        research articles in many archives or include them in coursepacks or use them for other
        responsible purposes. Those obstacles to sharing knowledge can be avoided without
        legislative intervention, however, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> alike embrace a legal
        paradigm for disseminating new discoveries that maximizes their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>.
