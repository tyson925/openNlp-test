          recurring concerns about the benefits and risks associated with open-access publishing in
          medicine and the biological sciences.
        
        Scientific societies serve their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, their broader scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, and the
        different components of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> in many important ways. Making peer-reviewed
        literature immediately accessible, searchable, and reusable to anyone in the world with an
        Internet connection is a uniquely direct means of achieving a number of goals that are
        common to most scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> and of advancing the diverse interests of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituencies</ENAMEX>.
        Setting aside for the moment the question of how feasible it is for societies to alter
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>' access policies, there is by now a broad consensus that widespread open
        access to scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> is good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and good for science. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> want to maximize the impact of their work‚Äîand articles that are freely available
        online are cited more frequently than those that are not (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence 2001).</ENAMEX> Most societies
        are committed to catalyzing innovations within and across scientific disciplines‚Äîand
        open-access archives of full-text literature provide a valuable tool for sharing
        information globally in order to accelerate the rate of scientific progress. Many societies
        articulate in their mission statements the goal of communicating the benefits of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' discoveries with the public‚Äîand open-access publishing is a direct means to
        accomplish this goal.
        In addition to an interest in exploring new ways to serve their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">missions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> have another compelling reason to investigate open access for their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>: the rapidly changing landscape of scholarly publishing. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1990 to 2000</TIMEX>, the
        average price of an academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> subscription increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> per year (Create Change
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). While society-run and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> may not be the major contributors to those
        spiraling costs, societies that rely on revenues from subscriptions and site licenses may
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> a disproportionate share of the negative consequences of skyrocketing serials prices.
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are forced for a variety of reasons (including decreased budgets and the
        increasing prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúbig deals‚Äù</ENAMEX> and journal bundling) to eliminate subscriptions,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> may be among the hardest hit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journals</ENAMEX> that appeal to a relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readership</ENAMEX> and those that are not part of larger publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are
        particularly vulnerable to the contraction of serials collections that has already begun
        and will likely accelerate (Create Change <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
      
      
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Society Is More Than a Journal</ENAMEX>
        The confluence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in favor of open access says nothing about its fiscal
        implications for scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>. As any systemic change in research or publishing
        would, the movement toward open access has generated concern about its ramifications for
        the scholarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> that often serve as the backbones of scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
        However, the strength of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> and their essential role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> they
        serve are precisely what should allay fears about the revenue-eroding effect that some
        argue would plague societies if they converted their traditional subscription-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> to open access.
        Scientific societies perform an array of tremendously valuable functions for their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> and disciplines. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX>, and others join societies for the
        many benefits of membership beyond simply discounted or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfree‚Äù subscriptions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>,
        so the concern that open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> would be the death knell of voluntary academic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> is misguided. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Marincola</ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for Cell Biology</ENAMEX>, recently noted, her society ‚Äúoffers a diverse range of products
        so that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> were at risk financially, we wouldn't lose our membership base
        because there are lots of other reasons why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are members‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anonymous 2003).</ENAMEX>
        While open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> can, in fact, be paid for in a number of different ways,
        there is no question that a transition toward the elimination of online access barriers
        requires most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> to restructure the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. If journal
        subscriptions generate surplus revenue that supports other society activities, then the
        business model of the society as a whole may need to be examined. This is not to say that
        open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> cannot generate a surplus or profit‚Äîsimply that they do not do so by
        restricting access to their primary research content.
      
      
        Testing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Open-Access Waters</ENAMEX>
        There are a number of societies that have already begun to take transitional steps to
        wean themselves from subscription revenues. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the earliest societies to commit to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">open-access</ENAMEX> publication, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Society for Clinical Investigation</ENAMEX> (ASCI) has since
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> provided the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Clinical Investigation</ENAMEX> (JCI) freely online and recently
        reaffirmed its commitment to open access: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúThe financing having been resolved, through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> charges and other means,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù John Hawley</ENAMEX>, the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASCI</ENAMEX> writes,
        ‚Äúthe 
        JCI hopefully can bring the greatest benefit to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>,
        regardless of who they might be. It is in this spirit that the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JCI</ENAMEX> has always been free online, and will remain so‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawley 2003).</ENAMEX>
        In order to experiment cautiously with new access policies, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> have
        implemented hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of access-restriction for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>. The American
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiological Society</ENAMEX>, for example, offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Physiological Genomics</ENAMEX> the option to pay a surcharge for their articles
        to be made freely available online immediately upon publication. A recent survey by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Information Systems Committee</ENAMEX> (JISC) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> suggests that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        would use such an option if it were more widely available: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> who had never
        published in an open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> who had done so indicated that they
        would be willing to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúpay a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> sold according to the traditional
        subscription model <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional</NUMEX> fee for them to make [the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s] particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> ‚Äòopen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">access‚Äô‚Äù</ENAMEX> (JISC <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JISC</ENAMEX> is also directly encouraging society and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> to implement hybrid
        models and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">open-access</ENAMEX> experiments and to launch new open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> by
        providing grants to offset the publication charges for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> during this transitional
        phase. In the long run, of course, open access will prove sustainable when more funders of
        research, in addition to interested <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, designate funds specifically for the
        costs of publishing articles to be made freely available, searchable, and reusable
        online.
      
      
        Starting the Dialogue
        Reaching a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äústeady-state‚</NUMEX>Äù system of open-access publishing by scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> will
        require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> critical components: recognition that open access serves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>' members
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>; diversified revenue streams not solely dependent on subscription or
        site-license fees; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society publishers</ENAMEX>' making use of recent innovations in journal
        production and dissemination, which can dramatically reduce the costs of publishing. It is,
        after all, the increased efficiencies born of new technologies‚Äîfrom the Internet itself to
        electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> management systems‚Äîthat have made the idea of open access possible. And
        while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of open access are confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> charges of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $1,500</NUMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> will be sufficient to cover the costs of publishing an efficiently operated society
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journal</ENAMEX>, there is no question that many existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> may need to update their
        infrastructure in order to make open access financially viable (PLoS <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        There is also no question that many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> do not, at present, have a wealth of
        revenue streams beyond the proceeds from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, which they often use to fund
        valuable activities from education initiatives to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> meetings. As open-access <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>
        become more established, however, and as the benefits of open access to scientific and
        medical literature become more apparent to society <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, the demand for the broadest
        possible dissemination of research is only likely to grow. Those societies that embrace the
        developments taking place in scholarly publishing may well see their membership and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> thrive more than societies that cling to the potentially unstable status
        quo.
        In any case, a constructive discussion about the pitfalls to be avoided and the benefits
        to be gained through a transition to open-access publishing would be a worthy <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step
        for any scientific society to take‚Äîand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS</ENAMEX> welcomes the questions, comments, and feedback
        of those who are intrigued by the potential that open access affords and want to learn
        more.
