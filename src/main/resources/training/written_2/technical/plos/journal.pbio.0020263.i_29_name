        research has led to ongoing debates about how to characterize and interpret genetic
        variation. Despite the mantra that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9%</NUMEX> of our genetic makeup, there is
        increasing interest in identifying the relatively small percentage difference that
        distinguishes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therein</ENAMEX> lies the paradox: if we are all the same, why do we
        continue to search for the ways in which we differ from one another? We can take an
        essential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward addressing this paradox by acknowledging the often conflicting
        stakes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in debates that center around genes, science, and race.
        Whose genes will be studied? For what purpose? And who has the authority to decide?
        These stakes are laid bare by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassandra Medley</ENAMEX> in her play â€œRelativity,â€ which ran at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Magic Theater</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX>, in a production directed by Edris
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooper-Anifowoshe</ENAMEX>. The play focuses on the inner conflict of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who tries unsuccessfully to straddle the opposing world views of her
        profession and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œRelativity</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Kalima Davis</ENAMEX> is a postdoctoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> in a
        prestigious stem <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell laboratory</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>. Her impeccable academic pedigree
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinguishes Kalima</ENAMEX> as a rising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>, and she is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> working in the field. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX> is also the devoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">charismatic psychotherapist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Reid</ENAMEX>, who directs the â€œLeon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis Foundation</ENAMEX>,â€ which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX>'s late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> dedicated to the belief that neuropeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX>, found in â€œpeople of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">â€</ENAMEX> enhances intelligence, athleticism, and emotional sensitivity. This theory also
        points to the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lighter skinned individuals</ENAMEX> as a cause of â€œwhite
        racism.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Kalima</ENAMEX>, who has inherited co-directorship of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>, is asked by
        her mother to offer â€œscientific proofâ€ of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX> theories and to discount the
        assertion that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are genetically similar.
        At issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œRelativityâ</ENAMEX>€ is the struggle over what constitutes a valid belief. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Reid</ENAMEX>
        suggests to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX> that â€œscience is not the sole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€˜Westâ€™</ENAMEX> defines it to
        be,â€ and refers to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acupuncture</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu Chakra</ENAMEX>, and tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> shamanism as
        examples of legitimate â€œsciences.â€ But the power of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> science to trump other
        interpretations of lived experience has become all too clear in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the genomic era</TIMEX>. Truth is
        excavated from the human body, where genes emerge as the iconographic oracles of our past,
        present, and future. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kalima</ENAMEX> recounts, â€œWe can't get around it. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is fact.â€
        Nonetheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX> naively attempts to find a way to retain these opposing epistemologies.
        The futility of this dual position is made apparent by the arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iris Preston</ENAMEX>, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> who has taken over as the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX>, a highly vocal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Reid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX> theories, serves as a formidable
        apostle of the scientific method. Shortly after her arrival, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> convenes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        her new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> to filter those seeking financial and other derivative rewards from the truly
        devoted, who are motivated solely by their â€œsense of wonder and amazementâ€ and their desire
        to â€œcultivate what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> referred to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as â</NUMEX>€˜holy curiosity.â€™â€ She makes plain that science,
        like all ideologies, demands consummate faith and unwavering piety.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX>'s struggle to claim her <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">â€œtrue lineageâ€</ENAMEX> is much more than a simple choice between
        her biological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX>) and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual mentor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX>). Her plight forces her
        to explore the meaning of justice. The contrast between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanin</ENAMEX> theories and genomic
        research, initially stark, blurs as it becomes increasingly clear that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> seek to use their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œscienceâ€</ENAMEX> to redress race-related disparities. Citing a history
        of racism, including the historically well-documented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuskegee Syphilis Study</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> asks
        rhetorically whether genetics research will result in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œgenetically modifiedâ</ENAMEX>€ white upper
        class and a lower, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark-skinned</TIMEX> â€œnatural birth classâ€? At stake are issues of power and
        trust, and the question of whether new genetic technologies will close the gaps between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or make them wider. Some postulate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œnew geneticsâ€</ENAMEX> will render conventional
        notions of race obsolete. However, it is doubtful that such a color-blind utopia will be
        won through the sequencing of genes without a serious engagement with the differences that
        lie outside cell walls. A social infrastructure of inequality that mediates race through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> deficits, exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>, and the use of the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> as the sole
        venue for healthcare will not be rehabilitated through gene therapy or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacogenomics</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> seeks to use her stature in science to focus on the inequities within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">academy</ENAMEX>. Encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX> to appear with her on a television program about stem-cell
        research, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> urges her to imagine the milestone of â€œnot just one, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> black women
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, holding forth among the usual cadre of white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>.â€ As one of the rare, highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">scrutinized, â€œminorityâ</ENAMEX>€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX> embodies a â€œdouble jeopardy.â€ She must prove
        that she is worthy of her positionâ€”that she is as good, if not better, than her â€œwhiteâ€
        peersâ€”yet she must always be â€œremembering from whence she came.â€ When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>, a white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kalima</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> who is also her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>, hears that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> has chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kalima</ENAMEX>
        to appear with her on television, he jealously accuses her of benefiting from preferential
        treatment. The play's depiction of this assertion of â€œreverse racismâ€ questions the
        legitimate use of race in evaluating promotion and achievement in science. What is apparent
        is that race, while an ever-present subject, is often presented as the antithesis of
        conventional notions of a color-blind meritocracy. Left to linger is the critical question:
        does merely identifying differences among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> constitute an act of racism? Can
        statements of racial differences be neutral, unfettered by a relative hierarchy?
        Medley throws into stark relief the politics around race and gender in science. She
        illuminates how an individual's dilemma transcends the private realm; personal decisions
        are never truly â€œpersonal,â€ but are inherently public because they always have wider social
        repercussions. In the fateful confrontation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalima</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> challenges
        her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œgrow upâ€</ENAMEX> and to risk her disapproval. A similar challenge can be issued to
        those who have inherited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œnew geneticsâ€â€”to</ENAMEX> vanquish the continuing paradox of reciting
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a â€œmantra</NUMEX> of samenessâ€ all the while searching for meaningful differences. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œRelativity</ENAMEX>,â€
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medley</ENAMEX> serves us a cautionary tale of the costs of our chronic ambivalence about the
        critical issues of race and justice in science. A good <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step is to recognize that the
        search for meaning in human difference is inseparable from the struggle over the moral
        order in which we live.
        To underestimate the power of science to define our social agenda is to lose an
        opportunity to determine our future course. We only need to look to history as our
        proof.
