        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX> of total global deaths. Many of these deaths could be prevented by
        tackling major risk factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and obesity as a result of unhealthy diet
        and physical inactivity, and smoking. Traditionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVDs</ENAMEX> have been considered a “Western”
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a “disease</NUMEX> of affluence” and not a pressing public health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for low-income
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. However, within upper-middle-income and high-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVDs</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> risk factors are increasingly concentrated among the lowest socioeconomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, and globally, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CVD</ENAMEX> deaths are in low-income and middle-income
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Majid Ezzati</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> conclude that a large
        proportion of the world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> living in low-income and middle-income countries
        should indeed be the focus of attention for CVD risk factors. This attention is needed
        because the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of the currently low-income and middle-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are
        expected to be those among whom major cardiovascular risk factors will increasingly be
        concentrated.
        The patterns of risks in relation to one another and to economic variables such as
        income are not fully established at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> level but need to be understood if
        better long-term policies and interventions are to be deployed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ezzati</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        examined when interventions should be started by looking at the relationship between
        nutritional cardiovascular risk factors—overweight and obesity, and elevated blood pressure
        and cholesterol—and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> economic indicators, using data for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        Their analysis uncovered economic–epidemiological patterns more complex than the “Western”
        or “affluence” labels would suggest. They found that body mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>) and cholesterol
        increased rapidly in relation to national income, then flattened, and eventually declined.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> increased most rapidly until an income of about I<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000</NUMEX> (international dollars) and
        peaked at about I<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12,500</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and I<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17,000</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Cholesterol showed a similar
        pattern, but with some delay. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> also found an inverse relationship between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and the share of household expenditure put towards <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and a positive
        relationship with proportion of population in urban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, which may be due to changes in
        patterns of diet and physical activity with city life. For blood pressure and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>,
        possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contributors</ENAMEX> to the decline at higher levels of income include dietary changes and
        use of pharmacological interventions.
        As more interventions for blood pressure and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> are adopted in high-income
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">societies</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> risk factors will become a feature of low-income and middle-income
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> say. Demographic and technological changes are increasingly modifying
        the income patterns of cardiovascular risk factors and shifting their burden to the
        developing world; as a result, low-income and middle-income <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> will simultaneously
        face the burden of infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and cardiovascular risk factors. Unless better
        interventions are pursued, we will face a world in which all major diseases are the
        diseases of the poor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> warn. (See also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perspective</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Novotny</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOI</ENAMEX>:
