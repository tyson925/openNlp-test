        an unusual one. Held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single day</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement auditorium</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berkeley Art Museum</ENAMEX>
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Berkeley</ENAMEX>, it brought together a typically motley
        collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> who would willingly give over a sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> to an
        opportunity to learn from a panel of distinguished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>. This was not the unusual part.
        Nor was it unusual that the meeting was touted as an interdisciplinary event, bringing
        together the best and brightest of different fields. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, and perhaps it has always
        been the case, interdisciplinarity is the rule rather than the exception of innovative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>.
        What set this meeting apart was the fluid progression from art to science, in content as
        well as in style. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> were more or less scientific, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> more or less
        artistic. The topic was empathy (‚ÄúEmpathy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brain</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Art‚Äù)‚</ENAMEX>Äîmore particularly,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man</ENAMEX>'s (and not just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s) ability to recognize and respond to the expressions of others.
        What do we respond to in an expression and what are the mechanisms in the brain that
        underlie these responses? And as the primatologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frans de Waal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emory University</ENAMEX>)
        highlighted, how much of our empathic natures do we share with our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ape cousins</ENAMEX>?
        In a slide presentation of her work and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of inspiration, portrait photographer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Dater</ENAMEX> clearly captured with great sensitivity an infinite variety of poignant
        expressions. However, when asked, she could not clearly articulate the choices she had made
        in posing and photographing her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, could not give dimensions to the criteria she was
        using. In contrast, the performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Pitt</ENAMEX> had clearly made a science out of
        expression. His physical demonstrations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balinese</ENAMEX> masks, carved into iconic images of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">happiness</ENAMEX>, sadness, or anger, gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> insight into the variety of subtle
        expression that could be attributed to the mask with simple postural adjustments. Happiness
        melted into melancholy, sadness into ennui. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúIt</ENAMEX>'s not about moving,‚Äù he observed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúit</ENAMEX>'s
        about not moving.‚Äù
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Ekman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at San Francisco</ENAMEX>) brought the
        official stamp of academia to his science of expression, documenting in the language of
        training-dependent effects on recognition the subtle range of expressions and
        microexpressions we can identify. For a practical example, he showed a clip from testimony
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O. J. Simpson</ENAMEX> trial of a moment in which the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúhouseguest‚Äù Kato Kaelin</ENAMEX> was
        caught out in a lie. A fleeting hostile look crossed his otherwise carefully schooled
        features: invisible until pointed out, unmistakable after.
        Where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> show us the richness of the human behavioral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repertoire</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuroscientist</ENAMEX> tries to break behaviors down into manageable, testable
        predictions of the associated brain activity. In contrast to the feasts of expression
        presented by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faces representative</ENAMEX> of basic emotions used by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cognitive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neuroscientist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Dolan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">College London</ENAMEX>) to study the neural activity
        engendered by expressions seemed almost too caricatured to be meaningful. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolan</ENAMEX>,
        introducing his subject through the portraiture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX>, deconstructed the information we derive from the expressions of others into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">categories‚Äîfamiliarity</ENAMEX>, identity, emotion, intentionality, and character‚Äîand was able to
        describe neural activity associated with carefully constructed experiments to probe each of
        these facets.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Physiologist Vittorio Gallese</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Parma</ENAMEX>) prompted many nods of satisfaction
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> with his findings of activity in areas of the brain controlling movement
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> simply watched the actions of others (see also the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Research Article</ENAMEX> by Iacoboni
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOI</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10.1371/journal.</ENAMEX> pbio<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0030079</NUMEX> ]). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Langer</ENAMEX>, in her
        book 
        Mind: An <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Essay on Human Feeling</ENAMEX> , has defined empathy as the direct
        physical reaction inherent in the perception of others, an 
        involuntary breach of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separateness</ENAMEX>, and to see the neural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resonance</ENAMEX>, to see that the same activity patterns were being recreated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observer</ENAMEX>, was to give substance to the intuition of empathy.
        Themed meetings, particularly when the theme does not conform to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> discipline, are
        hard to pull off. It can be nearly impossible to convince successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> on the
        lecture circuit to modify the presentation of their own work to support such a theme. In
        that respect, this meeting was no different from many‚Äîsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> were hard-pressed to
        conform to the theme, and it is not clear that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX> learned information of
        practical value to their work from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> across disciplines.
        However, it is not often that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have the luxury of stepping back and
        appreciating the context of their work in quite this way. It is not, for instance, usually
        appropriate to begin a paper on an apoptotic signaling pathway with a philosophical
        digression into the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death</ENAMEX>. The abstract dimensions that the visual neuroscientist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice O'Toole</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>) gave to facial characteristics are supposed
        to shed light on how we instantaneously recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> we have not seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>.
        The electrophysiological signals in the brain that neurophysiologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aina Puce</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia University</ENAMEX>) described when we view simple movements is ultimately meant to explain
        how we identify with the subtle shrugging of shoulders that can transmute insouciance into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insecurity</ENAMEX>.
        By reducing the problem to its simplest, most controlled form, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> hope to shed
        light on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of life. Auditory physiologists are supposed to tell us how we
        hear. And yet it will be a long time before they can explain ‚Äúmusic heard so deeply that it
        is not heard at all, but you are the music while the music lasts‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. S. Eliot</ENAMEX>, as quoted
        by the conference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semir Zeki</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University College London</ENAMEX>]). But the richness of
        the goal makes the journey all the more rewarding.
