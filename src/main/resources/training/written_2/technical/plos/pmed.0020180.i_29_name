        techniques have dramatically increased the incidence of multiple births, including
        monochorionic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glossary</ENAMEX>) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concomitantly</ENAMEX>, there have been advances in our
        understanding of these high-risk pregnancies.
      
      
        Risks of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Pregnancy</ENAMEX>
        The offspring of multiple pregnancies are at greater risk for adverse perinatal outcomes
        compared to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singleton counterparts</ENAMEX>, predominantly due to increased risks for preterm
        delivery and due to monochorionicity [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The link between monochorionicity and adverse
        perinatal outcomes has become increasingly strong [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Monochorionic pregnancies have an
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 15%</NUMEX> risk of developing the twin-to-twin transfusion <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> (TTTS), which
        can be associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">perinatal</ENAMEX> mortality and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity despite</ENAMEX> treatment [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. In
        addition, single intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) in a monochorionic pregnancy may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a more-than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> risk for multicystic encephalomalacia in the surviving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-twin [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        Managing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">High-Risk Pregnancies</ENAMEX>
        Despite these advances in knowledge about risks, there is very little consensus about
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of these high-risk pregnancies. In addition, there is the temptation to be
        reassured by increasing gestational age as the potential complications of prematurity
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recede</ENAMEX>. Recent studies suggest, however, that the offspring of a multiple gestation may
        benefit from delivering prior to their expected date of delivery [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>].
        Several studies have focused on the “prospective risk of fetal death” to help determine
        by which gestational age a multiple pregnancy should be delivered [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>]. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, the
        prospective risk of fetal death appears to be equivalent to that of post-term singletons at
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 to 38 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8</NUMEX>]. The prospective risk of fetal death for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX> intersects with neonatal death at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 39 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation, indicating that
        it may be reasonable to consider delivery of uncomplicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 weeks</TIMEX>'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gestation</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. These studies, however, did not address the impact of chorionicity on the
        decision to deliver a multiple pregnancy.
      
      
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Study of Monochorionic Twins</ENAMEX>
        In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barigye et al.</ENAMEX> report the prospective risk of fetal death
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">uncomplicated</TIMEX> monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies derived from a cohort of
        pregnancies that were managed at a single tertiary care referral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and that delivered
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were excluded from the study if the pregnancy was
        complicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTTS</ENAMEX>, monoamnionicity, intrauterine growth restriction, growth discordance,
        structural anomalies, or twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence. Conjoined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> and
        high-order multiples were also excluded. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with uncomplicated monochorionic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twins</ENAMEX> were managed according to a standard protocol. They received <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-trimester nuchal
        translucency assessment and chorionicity determination, a midtrimester anatomical survey,
        and fetal echo followed by growth scans, amniotic fluid assessment, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doppler</ENAMEX> studies
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX>. The rate of fetal death was derived for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> periods starting at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>' gestation. The prospective risk of fetal death was calculated by determining the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUFDs</ENAMEX> that occurred within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two-week</TIMEX> block divided by the number of continuing
        uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies during that same time period.
        There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> unexpected deaths (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUFDs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four single</NUMEX> IUFDs) in a total
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX> seemingly uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies.
        These IUFDs occurred at a median gestational age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34 weeks 1 day</TIMEX> (range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 weeks 0 days</TIMEX>
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 weeks 3 days</TIMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 24 and 34 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation, the prospective risk of fetal
        death varied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1/22 and 1/30</NUMEX> pregnancies. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation, the prospective
        risk of unexpected antepartum stillbirth was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/23</NUMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> pregnancies, the
        fetal death was incidental and found on routine ultrasound. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> case presented with
        decreased fetal movement.) There were no significant differences between the IUFD-affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pregnancies</ENAMEX> and the unaffected pregnancies with regards to antenatal indicators of
        intrauterine growth restriction and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTTS</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pregnancies (autopsy was
        declined in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases), deaths remained unexplained after autopsy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> cases, both double
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUFDs</ENAMEX>, exhibited signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTTS</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> concluded that despite intensive fetal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surveillance</ENAMEX>, uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies are at risk for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">unexpected</ENAMEX> intrauterine death. The deaths occurred in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> trimester and predominantly
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggested that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX>'
        gestation, the prospective risk for fetal death in these pregnancies might be eliminated by
        elective preterm delivery.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Implications of the Study</ENAMEX>
        Despite the limitations of the study, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barigye et al.</ENAMEX> elucidate well (small
        numbers, retrospective nature, lack of non-monochorionic twin comparative data), this study
        highlights an important question that many practicing obstetricians are confronting
        increasingly often: 
        when is the ideal gestational age to deliver apparently uncomplicated
        monochorionic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>? The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation may be reasonable. At
        that gestational age, many of the risks associated with prematurity, such as
        intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory distress syndrome</ENAMEX>,
        have abated.
        Nonetheless, the risks of prematurity are not negligible at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 weeks</TIMEX>' gestation.
        Balancing the risk of iatrogenic preterm birth in an 
        apparently uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancy with the risk of
        double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUFD</ENAMEX> or single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUFD</ENAMEX> with the concomitant risk of multicystic encephalomalacia for
        the surviving co-twin is challenging. In our practice, we have been conducting antenatal
        surveillance more frequently than once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>, and we have been using the
        nonstress test in addition to ultrasound and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doppler</ENAMEX> studies. Although in our preliminary
        experience we have not had any unexplained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUFDs</ENAMEX>, we are uncertain if the frequency of
        testing could account for the prospective risk of fetal death found in the study by Barigye
        et al. In addition, we have been offering delivery of these 
        apparently uncomplicated monochorionic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 34 to 35</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>' gestation following antenatal corticosteroid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and thorough counseling
        regarding the risks of expectant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> versus elective preterm delivery. While we
        acknowledge that our practice pattern is by no means a standard-of-care requirement, we
        feel it is a reasonable approach to this dilemma until larger, prospective observational
        studies have been conducted to better elucidate the natural history of these high-risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pregnancies</ENAMEX> and to better answer the question of when the ideal gestational age is to
        deliver apparently uncomplicated monochorionic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>.
