        cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeps</ENAMEX> have fascinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> and laymen alike‚Äînot only for their alien morphology
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), but also for epitomizing the perfect animal‚Äìmicrobe symbiosis. They are among
        the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> on this planet‚Äîsome <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 3 m long‚</NUMEX>Äîyet they do not eat other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Tubeworms</ENAMEX> thrive independently of photosynthetic production [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. They have even lost their
        entire digestive tract. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most exciting findings in early tubeworm research was
        the discovery that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is delivered by bacterial symbionts [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The
        chemoautotrophic symbionts live intracellularly in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">specialized worm</ENAMEX> tissue called the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trophosome</ENAMEX>. They are sulfide oxidizers, using the free energy yield from the oxidation of
        sulfide with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> to fix <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> with their bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Rubisco enzyme</ENAMEX>. In exchange
        for providing nutrition for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>, the symbionts are sheltered from grazing, but most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importantly</ENAMEX>, they receive a steady source of sulfide and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> via the highly adapted
        blood circulation system of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>. (I will never forget how horrified I was as a young
        student by the amounts of almost human-like blood flowing into my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> dish while dissecting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubeworms</ENAMEX> to analyze trophosome enzyme activity.) Tubeworm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood physiology</ENAMEX>, in particular
        the hemoglobin molecules, are tailored specifically to the needs of the symbionts. However,
        the host metabolism in itself is not different from that of many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, the main
        source of energy being aerobic respiration of carbohydrates. In other words, tubeworms and
        their symbionts need <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">electron acceptor‚Äîso</ENAMEX>, after all, they are dependent on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">photosynthesis</ENAMEX>, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>-producing process on earth.
      
      
        Classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Host</ENAMEX> and Symbiont
        With their strange morphology, vent tubeworms were first classified as a novel phylum,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vestimentifera</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Recently they have been regrouped together with the pogonophoran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubeworms</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) into a family of annelid polychaetes called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siboglinidae</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>].
        Vestimentiferan tubeworms of hydrothermal vents grow on chimneys and other hard substrates
        in the vicinity of active vents, which emit reduced compounds like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX> and sulfide
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vestimentiferan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tubeworms</ENAMEX> living at cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon seeps</ENAMEX>, i.e., the lamellibrachids
        and escarpids, are adapted to a sedimentary environment, with a substantial part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and tube of many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species extending</ENAMEX> into the mud. All vestimentiferan tubeworms found
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> at vents, seeps, and a few other reduced submarine habitats harbor sulfide-oxidizing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endosymbionts</ENAMEX> in their trophosome. These symbionts belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-proteobacteria clade and are phylogenetically related to each other [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. (For the
        only known exception see [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].)
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tubeworm Mysteries</ENAMEX>
        The study of tubeworms is now in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its fourth decade</TIMEX>, and there are still many fascinating
        problems to be solved. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most interesting‚Äîbut also most difficult‚Äîquestions in
        tubeworm symbiosis is how this obligate and highly integrated interaction between microbes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> evolved. How can a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> evolve into a perfect home for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemosynthetic bacteria</ENAMEX>?
        What are the main evolutionary steps towards this symbiosis, and in which order did they
        occur? Another intriguing problem is how the worms acquire their endosymbionts, which
        appear to be taken up from the environment‚Äîbut so far have not been detected as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living
        forms. How does the host recognize its specific symbiont from the vast diversity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-proteobacteria</ENAMEX> and sulfide oxidizers in the environment? Furthermore, how do
        tubeworms populate new vents, seeps, and other reducing environments emerging from the
        ever-changing ocean floor‚Äîhow do their larvae migrate and settle, and what determines the
        distribution and lifetime of tubeworm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in the different mid-ocean ridge and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">continental</ENAMEX> margin habitats? Although these questions are still to be answered, new
        research and techniques are beginning to provide intriguing clues.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seep Vestimentifera</ENAMEX> and Their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Source</ENAMEX>
        At some seeps the vestimentiferan tubeworms are so abundant that they form a special
        habitat that is attractive for a host of other marine species [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Seep vestimentiferans
        are usually thinner, have slower growth rates, and have greater longevity than their vent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. For example, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-m-long</NUMEX> 
        Lamellibrachia luymesi <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> is estimated to be more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> y old and hence represents the longest-lived animal on earth [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,12</NUMEX>]. At seeps,
        geological processes causing fluid and gas seepage can last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>,
        whereas hydrothermal vents often have a lifespan on the order of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. Vent tubeworm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> will die when their chimneys stop venting, i.e., delivering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfide</ENAMEX>, so they are
        adapted to a rapidly changing environment, as typified by their fast growth and high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX>.
        Like vent vestimentifera, seep vestmentifera also depend on the availability of sulfide
        in their direct vicinity, but they are sessile, and anchor on hard substrates such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbonates</ENAMEX>. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aggregations</ENAMEX> at seeps can consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of worms,
        requiring sulfide fluxes of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half a mole</NUMEX> per day‚Äîand this for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> y [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. So an
        ecological problem that has always intrigued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geochemists</ENAMEX> alike is how these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubeworms</ENAMEX> obtain their energy over the long term. Because vent and seep vestimentifera
        depend on sulfide-oxidizing symbionts, their distribution is limited to habitats with high
        sulfide fluxes lasting for at least a few reproductive cycles. However, at cold seeps,
        unlike hydrothermal vents, most of the chemical energy occurs in the form of hydrocarbons.
        Cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeps</ENAMEX> are characterized by high fluxes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methane</ENAMEX>, higher hydrocarbons (such as
        ethane, propane, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butane</ENAMEX>), and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">petroleum</ENAMEX> from deep subsurface <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX>. Often the
        source <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> do not contain much sulfide, because there are no high-temperature
        seawater‚Äìrock interactions involved in their formation, as there are at vents. Some
        pogonophoran tubeworms at seeps have teamed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methane</ENAMEX>-oxidizing symbionts to profit from
        the high availability of hydrocarbons, but seep vestimentiferans do not appear to be able
        to directly tap this resource. However, seep vestimentiferans are still capable of
        producing enormous biomass over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> with the help of their sulfide-oxidizing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symbionts</ENAMEX>. So where does the supply of sulfide come from at seeps that enables such large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregations</ENAMEX> to be maintained for so long?
        Only recently was it realized that anaerobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microbial</ENAMEX> processes, namely, the oxidation
        of hydrocarbons with sulfate, could produce astonishingly high fluxes of sulfide in cold
        seep settings [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,14</NUMEX>]. At methane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeps</ENAMEX>, methanotrophic microbial communities inhabiting
        the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sediments oxidize methane</ENAMEX> with sulfate, which results in very high sulfide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluxes</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seepage</ENAMEX> consists of other hydrocarbons such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">petroleum</ENAMEX>, their
        degradation with sulfate supports an even higher production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfide</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. In some seep
        sediments, sulfide concentrations can reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM in subsurface sediments (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5‚Äì10</NUMEX> cm below
        the sediment surface). Such concentrations are not known from tubeworm habitats at
        hydrothermal vents.
        However, the zones of high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon</ENAMEX> turnover and sulfide flux at seeps are often
        limited to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few centimeters</NUMEX> below the seafloor, depending on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon</ENAMEX> flows and
        the rate of sulfate transport from the bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> into the sediments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulfate</ENAMEX> is crucial
        because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon-degrading microbes</ENAMEX> in seep sediments depend on this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> acceptor for an energy yield. Without sulfate to fuel the oxidation of
        hydrocarbons, sulfide production stops, even if there is still an enormous reservoir of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon</ENAMEX> available. How might tubeworms, sulfide-oxidizing symbionts, and benthic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon degraders</ENAMEX> overcome these limitations?
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M√©nage √† Trois‚ÄîA Model Solution</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cordes et al.</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] have now provided an answer to how the stability of sulfide
        production is maintained over such long periods and how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> optimize sulfide uptake.
        Seep vestimentifera have specific adaptations to their habitat. A main adaptation is the
        subsurface part of the lamellibrachids called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúroot</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The tubeworm root appears to have a
        special function in the energy cycle of the organism‚Äîas in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> roots. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        have proposed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> roots are not only important in sulfide uptake, but generally
        in geochemical engineering of the sediments in the direct environment [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,17,18</NUMEX>]. Obviously
        such hypotheses are very difficult to test‚Äîtoday it is still hardly possible to measure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, petroleum, and sulfide fluxes in the seafloor in situ at depth, especially below
        tubeworm aggregations. But it is also not possible to recover whole aggregations of worms
        and to keep them alive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> for biochemical and biogeochemical measurements‚Äîthis
        would require simulation of seepage under pressure. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cordes et al.</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,15</NUMEX>] have
        used geochemical and biological modeling to solve the intriguing question of seep
        vestimentiferan longevity and how they might also interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living anaerobic
        microbes to increase sulfide availability.
        To explain the persistence of the large tubeworm <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX>, Cordes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> suggest a broader mutualistic interaction between the tubeworm, its endosymbiont,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">benthic hydrocarbon</ENAMEX>-degrading and sulfide-producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX>. Seep tubeworms take up
        sulfide from the sulfide-rich subsurface sediment zones through the roots, but, crucially,
        they may also release sulfate through the roots as a byproduct of sulfide oxidation by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tubeworm</ENAMEX>'s endosymbiont. Sulfate may also be ventilated through the tube into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sediments</ENAMEX>. Since anaerobic microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in subsurface hydrocarbon-rich sediments
        are limited by sulfate influx, any additional supply of sulfate enhances their production
        of sulfide. Furthermore, the removal of sulfide by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> will thermodynamically favor
        anaerobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon oxidation</ENAMEX> coupled to sulfate reduction. Hence, the tubeworm roots may
        provide an excellent habitat for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidizers</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cordes et</ENAMEX>
        al. predict in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that nearly all of the sulfate released through the root will be
        utilized by benthic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation</ENAMEX> in the direct vicinity
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>. This process could provide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the sulfide needed by a tubeworm aggregation
        to persist for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">y. Hence</ENAMEX>, it may even be concluded that tubeworms farm anaerobic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrocarbon degraders</ENAMEX> to provide a steady supply of sulfide to their endosymbionts.
        Especially at petroleum seeps, this would guarantee a lifelong energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and help
        explain the extraordinary longevity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>. The mutual benefit arising from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of sulfide oxidizers, sulfate reducers, and a host <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> is known to be
        exploited by the oligochaete 
        Olavius algarvensis [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. In this very effective <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúm√©nage √†</ENAMEX>
        trois‚Äù the sulfate reducer has even become an endosymbiont of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, some
        of our recent studies at the methane seeps of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hydrate Ridge</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cascadia</ENAMEX> margin) also show
        that certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anaerobic methane oxidizers</ENAMEX> are specifically associated with
        seep organisms‚Äîsuch as the symbiotic clam 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calyptogena</ENAMEX> and the giant filamentous sulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidizer</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beggiatoa</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. But many more examples may be out there, of
        bacterial and archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> specifically growing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúrhizosphere‚Äù</ENAMEX> of benthic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, potentially profiting from bioturbation, bioirrigation, fecal deposits, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exudates</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and interaction between benthic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> and sedimentary microorganisms is
        a very interesting field of study, although inevitably still very speculative. So far it
        has been limited by a lack of appropriate technologies, not only for in situ biogeochemical
        and biological measurements, but also for quantitative investigation of specific functional
        microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insight</ENAMEX> can be provided by clever environmental modeling
        approaches‚Äîsuch as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cordes et al.</ENAMEX>, but ultimately the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> need
        empirical verification. Only very recently has it become possible to combine visually
        targeted sampling (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and high-resolution measurements of geochemical gradients with
        molecular tools for the identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rDNA</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">organic-biomarker</ENAMEX>-based techniques. For the study of continental margin and deep-sea
        ecosystems, this requires the availability of underwater <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) as well as
        multidisciplinary research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> and extensive, highly detailed lab work‚Äîso this is
        very expensive research. Yet this is the future, if we want to determine whether such an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intriguing m√©nage √† trois</ENAMEX> as proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cordes et al.</ENAMEX> accounts for the presence and
        longevity of these extraordinary tubeworms, and possibly also other chemosynthetic
        symbioses, forming some of the most fascinating marine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ecosystems</ENAMEX> at continental
        margins.
