        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> may have a zoonotic origin [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Evidence suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agriculture</ENAMEX> has contributed to antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in the pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
        but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> from cause to effect is long and complicated.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibiotic</ENAMEX> use clearly selects for antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, but how far do these effects
        extend beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> where antibiotics are used? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antibiotics</ENAMEX> and
        antibiotic-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX>) are found in the air and soil around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>, in surface
        and ground <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, in wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, and on retail <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2‚Äì9</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX> are
        carried into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> on contaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX>, where other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-contaminated because of common unsafe handling practices [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11</NUMEX>]. Following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ingestion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> occasionally survive the formidable but imperfect gastric barrier, and
        colonize the gut [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        Patterns of colonization (asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>) and infection (symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>) in
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> provide additional evidence that ARB occasionally move from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,14</NUMEX>]. The strongest evidence comes from the history of the use of antibiotics for
        growth promotion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. After first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX> and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> banned the use
        of antibiotics for growth promotion, prevalence of resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> declined in farm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, in retail <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX>, and within the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human population</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,15</NUMEX>].
        Despite the evidence linking bacterial antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> to resistance in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the impact of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use remains controversial [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16‚Äì19</NUMEX>] and poorly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX>. This is partly because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of population-level processes underlying
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species (‚Äúheterospecific‚Äù</ENAMEX>) and within-species, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>-to-host <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
        spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX>. To emerge as human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pathogens</ENAMEX>, new strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX> must (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) evolve,
        originating from mutations or gene transfer; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) spread, usually horizontally among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
        or animals, but occasionally heterospecifically; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> of these steps are complex and imperfectly understood. The emergence of a new
        type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is a highly random event, which can't be predicted accurately, and may
        involve multiple steps that preclude perfect understanding even after the fact. Spread is
        equally complicated and may obscure the origins of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. In some cases, emergence of
        resistance in one bacterial species is a consequence of the emergence and spread in another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, followed by the transfer of resistance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from one bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to
        another. Because of the underlying complexity, mathematical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are necessary to develop
        theory‚Äîa qualitative understanding of the underlying epidemiological processes [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20‚Äì25</NUMEX>].
        Theory helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> organize facts, identify missing information, design surveillance,
        and analyze data [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horizontal Transmission</ENAMEX>
        Theory clearly shows that the impact of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use depends on whether
        resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> have high, low, or intermediate horizontal transmission rates in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23,24</NUMEX>]. The rate of horizontal transmission among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is determined by the
        underlying biology of the pathogen, medical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use, and hospital infection control,
        but not by agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. On the other hand, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> where multiple
        antibiotics are used routinely, universally, and in low quantities for growth promotion is
        likely to be an excellent environment for the evolution of multiple resistance factors,
        including some variants that might never have evolved in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Thus, even very rare
        transmission resulting from agricultural antibiotics may have a medical impact by
        introducing new resistant variants to the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The epidemiology of spread in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> dictates how the impact of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use should be
        assessed.
        Zoonotic pathogens, such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campylobacter</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Salmonella</ENAMEX> , are generally regarded as having low horizontal
        transmission rates in human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in zoonotic infections should be
        directly attributable to resistance in the zoonotic reservoir, the impact of agricultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use remains controversial [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,27‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äì29</ENAMEX>]. Zoonotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> could acquire resistance
        genes from human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">commensal bacteria</ENAMEX> during the infection process, but this hypothesis is
        difficult to test.
        For pathogens with high horizontal transmission rates, resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> will spread
        rapidly once they have emerged, and prevalence will be maintained at a steady state by
        horizontal transmission. Thus, the impact of subsequent heterospecific transmission is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Nevertheless, one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> heterospecific transmission events could be
        sufficient to cause the appearance of a highly successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ARB</ENAMEX> genotype in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, affecting
        the timing, nature, and extent of spread within the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Not only are
        such events difficult to trace, but their impact is impossible to measure, since there is
        no way to know what type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> would have appeared and with what temporal pattern,
        if transfers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> had been prevented.
        The case where horizontal human transmission rates are intermediate is particularly
        interesting. If each case in a population generates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one</NUMEX> new case (a situation
        we call ‚Äúquasi-epidemic‚Äù transmission), each instance of heterospecific transmission will
        initiate a long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of horizontal transmission that eventually burns out. Quasi-epidemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> can amplify a relatively low amount of heterospecific transmission and
        substantially increase prevalence [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23‚Äì25</NUMEX>]. The effect is sustained as long as
        heterospecific transmission continues. A corollary is that banning agricultural antibiotic
        use would have maximal benefits if horizontal transmission is quasi-epidemic [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        Moreover, the effects are most difficult to estimate because both heterospecific and
        horizontal transmission must be accounted for.
        These principles apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> associated with outpatient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>-acquired infections as well as those that are primarily hospital-acquired.
        Although quasi-epidemic transmission would seem to be a special case, it may in fact be the
        rule for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> because it is the natural endpoint of the
        interplay between economics and ecology [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. By spending money on hospital infection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> can reduce nosocomial transmission rates for resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> may screen and isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are likely to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> (i.e., active surveillance) and implement infection-control measures, but this
        comes at the cost of isolating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Total costs are minimized by spending just
        enough to eliminate (or nearly eliminate) the pathogen; thus, quasi-epidemic transmission
        is the economic optimum [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>].
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX> as a Reservoir for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resistance</ENAMEX>
        Horizontal transmission is further complicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> structure, such as the
        movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and long-term care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use
        and horizontal transmission rates are high in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, but this is counterbalanced by
        short hospital stays. An emerging view for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>-acquired bacterial infections is that
        persistent asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> plays a key role in the epidemic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX> can
        asymptomatically colonize a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>: even if the number of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> infected
        during a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> visit is less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, this number will exceed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> when summed
        over several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> visits [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,32,33</NUMEX>]. Thus, the ecological reservoir of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> plays an important role in the increasing frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>-acquired infections.
        Short <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> visits and long persistence times of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> guarantee that some of
        the costs associated with failed infection control are passed on to other hospitals‚Äînew
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> are frequently discharged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hospital only to be admitted to another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> later [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Thus, the harm done by these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ARB</ENAMEX> is borne by the whole human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, particularly all of the health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that serve a single catchment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In economic terms, the damage caused by the carriage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX> is a kind of
        pollution.
        By comparing the total number of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> generated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, the impacts of
        agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> can be compared directly to the impact hospitals
        have on each other (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The rate of heterospecific transmission is intrinsically
        difficult to measure directly because the risk of exposure and colonization per meal is
        very small. Nevertheless, agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use may generate as many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> for the simple reason that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> experiences many more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> than
        hospital discharges [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. When agricultural and nosocomial transmission are equally rare in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the latter will be much easier to identify and quantify.
      
      
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Natural Experiment: Glycopeptides and Vancomycin-Resistant</ENAMEX> Enterococci
        Is the impact of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use on the emergence and spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARB</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> large or small relative to medical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use? Put another way, are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> or
        hospitals bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">polluters</ENAMEX>? A large-scale natural experiment was conducted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> and several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> when each adopted different policies on glycopeptide
        use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (avoparcin) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> (vancomycin) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,17,35‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äì37</ENAMEX>]. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>
        approved avoparcin for animal growth promotion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> did not.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, demand for vancomycin in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> surged because of increasing
        aminoglycoside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> among enterococci and methicillin resistance in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Staphylococcus aureus</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> also used
        oral vancomycin for some 
        Clostridium difficile infections [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37‚Äì39</NUMEX>]. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) emerged and spread through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        health-care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> used less vancomycin because most enterococci
        were sensitive to aminoglycosides, and oral vancomycin was seldom used. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> still emerged
        and spread through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, but the problem has been less severe than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>].
        A different pattern emerges for community prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> are rarely found
        outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>, except for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have a prior history of
        hospitalization. Community prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is typically <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX>. In
        contrast, community prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>%‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äì12%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> during the late
        1990s, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with no history of hospitalization [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,41‚</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äì48</ENAMEX>]. In other
        words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> community reservoir generated by vancomycin use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avoparcin</ENAMEX> use in agriculture was apparently much larger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> reservoir
        generated only by vancomycin use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.
        The prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> declined after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> banned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">avoparcin</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        Thus, avoparcin is at least partly responsible for the reservoir of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> in the European
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, but how much of that reservoir came from avoparcin and how much came from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>? To weigh the impact, we subtract the community prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>) from the community prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>). The remainder (><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>) is
        attributed to avoparcin. This analysis probably underestimates the real impact because
        vancomycin was used less in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Thus, avoparcin use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
        would appear to be responsible for generating a larger reservoir of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> in the community
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Put another way, the impact of avoparcin use on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> was
        larger than the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> on one another.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Despite the evidence that avoparcin use has had a large impact on the emergence and
        spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> by increasing the reservoir of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>, some uncertainty continues to
        surround the clinical significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VRE</ENAMEX> strains of animal origin and of the zoonotic
        origins of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in general. Bacterial strains circulating in hospitalized populations
        may be genetically distinct from those circulating in the general human population
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,17,49</NUMEX>]. Thus, bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> are some combination of zoonotic, quasi-epidemic,
        and epidemic strains. The complexity of bacterial population biology and genetics makes it
        practically impossible to trace <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (or resistance factors) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>, or to directly attribute some fraction of new infections to agricultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use. Asymptomatic carriage of resistance factors by nonfocal commensal bacteria
        adds to a general risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, but transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> among bacterial species is
        unpredictable and difficult to quantify. Until more evidence is available, it is prudent
        and reasonable to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with resistance genes a general threat [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50‚Äì52</NUMEX>].
        Some part of the controversy over agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use has been a disagreement
        about how to weigh evidence and make decisions when the underlying biological processes are
        complex. In this case, the effects of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use on human health remain
        uncertain, despite extensive investigation, and the effects may be unknowable, unprovable,
        or immeasurable by the empirical standards of experimental biology. What should be done
        when complexity makes an important public-health effect intrinsically difficult to measure?
        What is an appropriate ‚Äúnull hypothesis‚Äù or its equivalent? Should the same standards of
        proof be used in science and science-based policy? Where should the burden of proof
        fall?
        Scientific assessments for policy should summarize the best state of the science,
        recognizing that the burdens and standards of proof are necessarily softer because of the
        uncertainty that is introduced by biological complexity. The best decisions weigh the
        evidence in light of the inherent uncertainty. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> banned the use of antibiotics for
        growth promotion, based on the precautionary principle. The use of the precautionary
        principle was criticized by some as unscientific in this context. In fact, the intrinsic
        problem of knowability, posed by the biological complexity of the problem, makes the use of
        precautionary decision making particularly suitable in this arena. The assumption that
        plausible dangers are negligible, even when it is known that such dangers are
        constitutively very difficult to measure, may be more unscientific than the use of
        precaution.
