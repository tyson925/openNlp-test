        in a single project, the ideal of scientific cooperation finds a new expression. Free
        community science was inspired by the free software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>, which itself was inspired by
        the application of the ideal of scientific cooperation, as it was applied to software
        development by the operating system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artificial Intelligence Lab</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. This ideal has suffered for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX> from
        corporate pressure to privatize science, so it is very gratifying to see that the free
        software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> can today help reinvigorate the principle that inspired it.
        The ideal of scientific cooperation goes beyond the conduct of individual projects.
        Scientific cooperation is also being reinvigorated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> through the open-access movement,
        which promotes the public's freedom to redistribute scientific and scholarly articles. In
        the age of the computer networks, the best way to disseminate scientific writing is by
        making it freely accessible to all and letting everyone redistribute it. I give a vote of
        thanks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Library of Science</ENAMEX> for leading the campaign that is now gaining
        momentum. When research funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> to allow free redistribution of
        new articles they fund, they should apply this demand to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">articles ‚Äúowned‚Äù</ENAMEX> by the
        same publishers‚Äînot just to papers published starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> can promote scientific cooperation by adopting standards requiring
        internet publication of the supporting data and software for the articles they publish. The
        software and the data will be useful for other research. Moreover, research carried out
        using software cannot be checked or evaluated properly by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> unless they can
        read the source code that was used.
        A significant impediment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> and cooperation comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> patent
        policies. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> hope to strike it rich with patents, but this is as foolish as
        playing the lottery, since most ‚Äútechnology licensing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices‚</ENAMEX>Äù don't even cover their
        operating costs. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Queen</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> are running hard to stay in the
        same place. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> should recognize that funding university research through patents is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">folly</ENAMEX>, and should fund it directly, as in the past. Meanwhile, laws that encourage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> to seek patents at the expense of cooperation in research should be
        changed.
        Another impediment comes from strings attached to corporate research funding.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Universities</ENAMEX> or their public funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should ensure private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> cannot block
        research they do not like. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> must never have the power to veto or delay
        publication of results‚Äîor to intimidate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> whose interests
        could be hurt by publication of certain possible results must never be in a position to cut
        the funding for a specific research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        The free software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>, the free redistribution policy of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, and the
        practice of free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> science for developing diagnostic disease classifications [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]
        are all based on the same fundamental principle: knowledge contributes to society when it
        can be shared and developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> face opposition from those who would
        like to privatize knowledge and charge tolls for its use. In the free software movement we
        have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>' experience in resisting this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX>, and we have built up considerable
        strength and momentum. We can give the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> movements a boost, so they can advance
        more quickly.
