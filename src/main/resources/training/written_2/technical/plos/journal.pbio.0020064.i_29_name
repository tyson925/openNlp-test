        high enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caloric</ENAMEX> content could mean a slow death from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malnutrition</ENAMEX>. Failure to detect a
        poison could result in near-instant expiration. And now, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> begin to understand
        some of the nuts and bolts of taste perception, it seems that the sense of taste may also
        have more subtle effects on health.
      
      
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basics</ENAMEX> of Taste
        At the front line of the taste sensory system are the taste budsâ€”onion-shaped structures
        on the tongue and elsewhere in the mouth (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Up to 100</NUMEX> taste receptor
        cellsâ€”epithelial cells with some neuronal propertiesâ€”are arranged in each taste bud. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tongue</ENAMEX>, the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> are innervated by the chorda tympani (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the facial nerve)
        and the glossopharyngeal nerve. These nerves carry the taste messages to the brain.
        Taste is the sense by which the chemical qualities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in the mouth are
        distinguished by the brain, based on information provided by the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. Quality or
        â€˜basic tasteâ€™, explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernd Lindemann</ENAMEX>, now retired but an active taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, is a psychophysical term. Large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> describe
        different tastants and then statistical analyses are used to define the important tastes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€˜The</ENAMEX> number of taste qualities has varied over the yearsâ€™, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindemann</ENAMEX>. â€˜We are now
        settling at around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, though I would not be surprised if some additional qualities pop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upâ€™.</ENAMEX>
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> qualities that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindemann</ENAMEX> refers to are salty, sour, bitter, sweet, and umami,
        the last being the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> term for a savoury sensation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salty</ENAMEX> and sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detection</ENAMEX> is
        needed to control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> balance. Bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> warns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> containing
        poisonsâ€”many of the poisonous compounds produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> for defence are bitter. The
        quality sweet provides a guide to calorie-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. And umami (the taste of the amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid glutamate</ENAMEX>) may flag up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-rich foods</ENAMEX>. Our sense of taste has a simple goal,
        explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindemann</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜Food is already in the mouth. We just have to decide whether to
        swallow or spit it out. It's an extremely important decision, but it can be made based on a
        few taste qualitiesâ€™.
      
      
        From Physiology to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Biology</ENAMEX>
        Taste has been actively researched for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many decades</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiologists</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> worked hard to understand this seemingly simple
        sense system. Then, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> were described. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        which are exposed on the surface of cells in the nose, bind to volatile chemicals and allow
        us to detect smells. This landmark discovery, in part, encouraged many established taste
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to investigate the molecular aspects of taste.
        The olfaction results also enticed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> from other disciplines into the taste
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Zuker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSD</ENAMEX>],
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Ryba</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Dental</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craniofacial Research</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIDCR</ENAMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About six years ago</TIMEX>,
        explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuker</ENAMEX>, who previously worked on other sensory systems in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>, â€˜there was a
        disconnect between our understanding of sensations in the case of photoreception,
        mechanoreception, touch, and so on and what we knew about tasteâ€™. There was evidence, says
        Ryba, that a class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein receptors</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> (GPCRs) were
        involved in sweet and bitter taste, â€˜but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> weren't known, so we started to look
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">them â€¦</ENAMEX>. These molecules are intrinsically interesting, but more importantly, they
        provide tools with which we can dissect out how taste worksâ€™.
      
      
        Bitter, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sweet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umami Receptors</ENAMEX>
        The bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> fell <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to the onslaught of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSDâ</ENAMEX>€“NIDCR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and other
        molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the ability to taste propylthiouracil, a bitter tasting
        compound, had been linked to a locus on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Chromosome 5p15</ENAMEX>. Reasoning that this
        variation might be due to alterations in the coding sequence for a bitter receptor, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSDâ</ENAMEX>€“NIDCR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> used the draft of the human genome to search for sequences that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resembled GPCRs</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chromosome 5p15</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€˜That</ENAMEX> was how we found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2R1</TIMEX>, the first bitter receptor,
        and, subsequently, a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2Rsâ€™</TIMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuker</ENAMEX>.
        
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> want to know: how is taste coded?
          
        
        All these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuker</ENAMEX>, are coexpressed in bitter taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX>, a
        result that contradicts other research showing that different bitter-responsive cells react
        to different bitter molecules. â€˜To meâ€™, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuker</ENAMEX>, â€˜it makes sense that all the bitter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors would be</ENAMEX> expressed in each bitter taste cell. We just need to know if something
        is bitter to avoid deathâ€™, not the exact identity of the bitter tastant.
        The sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> story started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> with the identification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> putative
        mammalian taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> now known as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1R1 and T1R2</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> groups
        reported an association between the mouse 
        Sac locus, which determines the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to detect saccharin, and
        T1R3, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSDâ</ENAMEX>€“NIDCR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> subsequently showed that the
        T1R2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1R3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">heterodimer</ENAMEX> (a complex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T1R2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> T1R3 molecule) forms a broadly
        tuned sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, responsive to natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugars</ENAMEX> and artificial sweeteners, and that a
        homodimer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> T1R3 molecules forms a low-affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> receptor that responds to high
        concentrations of natural sugars only. All sweet detection, concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuker</ENAMEX>, is via the
        T1R2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T1R3 receptors</ENAMEX>.
        And umami? A truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor</ENAMEX> was identified as an umami <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Miami</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Medicine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.
        Zuker, however, believes that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and only umami <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is a heterodimer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T1R1</ENAMEX> and
        T1R3. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2003</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuker</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coworkers</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in which either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1R1</ENAMEX> or
        T1R3 has been knocked out show no preference for monosodium glutamate (MSG), an umami
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tastant</ENAMEX>. However, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2003</TIMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T1R3</NUMEX> knockouts retain some
        preference for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSG</ENAMEX>. â€˜We believe this is due either to the truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptor</ENAMEX> or
        another unknown receptorâ€™, says lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sami Damak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Sinai School of Medicine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damak</ENAMEX> says he does not know why the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of T1R3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX> behaved differently, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSDâ</ENAMEX>€“NIDCR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> suggest that the residual
        response to MSG seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damak et al.</ENAMEX> is a response to the sodium content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSG</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damak</ENAMEX> is
        not alone, however, in thinking there may be more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> umami <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (and additional
        sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>).
        Commenting on these recent discoveries, taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Bartoshuk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale University</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Medicine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Haven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) says that â€˜it is lovely to see
        all these details, especially as they confirm what we already believed conceptuallyâ€™. For
        example, she says, it is no surprise that there are many bitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> but probably only
        one sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. â€˜There are so many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poisons</ENAMEX> and it makes perfect sense to have lots of
        receptors feeding into a common transduction pathway. Sweet is a different problem. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, there are many molecules with structures similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> that we must not eat
        because we cannot metabolise them. So I would have predicted one or at most a few highly
        specific sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptorsâ€™</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        What about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Salty and Sour Receptors</ENAMEX>?
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">salty</ENAMEX> and sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may be very different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> involved in bitter,
        sweet, and umami perception, which bind complex molecules on the outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and
        transmit a signal into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salty</ENAMEX> and sour perception, the taste cell only needs
        to detect simple ions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to do this may be to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ion channelsâ</ENAMEX>€”proteins that form a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> through which specific inorganic ions can diffuse. Changes in cellular ion
        concentrations could then be detected and transmitted to the nervous system.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Physiologist John DeSimone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Commonwealth University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>) says there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> ion channel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> in rodent taste receptor
        cells. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these is the epithelial sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, a widely expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that
        can be blocked specifically with the drug amiloride. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeSimone</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 75%</NUMEX> of
        the nerve response to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> can be blocked by amiloride, so there is probably a second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. This, he says, seems to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">generalist salt receptorâ€”the amiloride</ENAMEX>-sensitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> only responds to sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorideâ</ENAMEX>€”and may be the more important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        Sour tastants are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, often found in spoiled or unripe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DeSimone</ENAMEX>'s current idea
        is that strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> enter taste cells through a proton channel (probably a known channel
        present on other cell types) while weak <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetic acid</ENAMEX> (vinegar), enter as neutral
        molecules and then dissociate to lower intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pH.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeSimone</ENAMEX> believes that he has
        identified the proton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> involved in sour taste as well as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channel</ENAMEX> that could
        be the second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> receptor, and he plans to do knockout experiments on both. If these
        channels are essential elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DeSimone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX>, to avoid lethality he
        will need to construct conditional knockouts in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> is lost only in the taste
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX>.
        Zuker, meanwhile, is not convinced that the current ion channel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and
        sour perception are correct. And, he says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> could also be involved in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modalities</ENAMEX>. â€˜There is a precedent for thatâ€™, he claims, noting that extracellular calcium
        is sensed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCR</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Taste-Coding
        With many taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> now identified, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are turning to a long-standing
        question in taste perception: how is taste coded? When we eat, our tongue is bombarded with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tastants</ENAMEX>. How is their detection and transduction of information organised so that the
        appropriate response is elicited? Taste physiologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sue Kinnamon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado State</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Collins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) explains the two theories of
        taste-coding. In the â€˜labelled-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lineâ€™ model</ENAMEX>, sweet-sensitive cells, for example, are hooked
        up to sweet-sensitive nerve fibres that go to the brain and code sweet. If you stimulate
        that pathway, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinnamon</ENAMEX>, â€˜you should elicit the appropriate behavioural response
        without any input from other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell typesâ€™</ENAMEX>. In the â€˜cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fibreâ€™ model</ENAMEX>, the pattern of
        activity over many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> codes taste. This model predicts that taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> are
        broadly tuned, responding to many tastants. Support for this theory, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinnamon</ENAMEX>, comes
        from electrical recordings from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX> and from nerves innervating the taste buds
        that show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> can respond to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> taste quality.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryba</ENAMEX>'s recent work strongly suggests that taste-coding for bitter, sweet, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">umami</ENAMEX> fits the labelled-line model in the periphery of the taste system. Their expression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> show that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for these qualities are expressed in distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of taste
        cells. In addition, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2003</TIMEX>, they reported that, as in other sensory systems, a
        single signalling pathway involving the ion channel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TRPM5 and PLCÎ²2</TIMEX>, a phospholipase that
        produces a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">TRPM5</NUMEX> activator, lies downstream of the bitter, sweet, and umami <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. When
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCSDâ</ENAMEX>€“NIDCR <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> took PLCÎ²2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout mice</ENAMEX>, which did not respond to bitter,
        sweet, or umami, and engineered them so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCÎ²2</ENAMEX> was only expressed in bitter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-expressing cells, only the ability to respond to bitter tastants was regained.
        These data, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuker</ENAMEX>, support the labelled-line model.
        The latest data supporting the labelled-line model came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuker</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> described <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in which a non-taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptorâ€”a modified Îº-opioid receptor</ENAMEX> that
        can only be activated by a synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligandâ</ENAMEX>€”was expressed only in cells expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1R2</TIMEX>,
        sweet-responsive cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were attracted to the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligand</ENAMEX>, which they
        normally ignore, indicating that dedicated pathways mediate attractive behaviours. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> plan similar experiments to see whether the same is true for aversive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">behaviours</ENAMEX>.
        Even with all these molecular data, the cross-fibre model of taste-coding still has its
        supportersâ€”just how many depends on whom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> talks to. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinnamon</ENAMEX>, for
        example, believe that there is at least some involvement of cross-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibre patterning</ENAMEX> even in
        the taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor cells</ENAMEX>. But, says neurobiologist and olfaction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence C. Katz</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), â€˜the onus is now on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
        believe otherwise [than the labelled-line model] to provide compelling proof for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-fibre theory because now, at least at the periphery, the evidence is compelling for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labelled</ENAMEX> line for bitter, sweet, and umamiâ€™. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartoshuk</ENAMEX> also says the debate is decided in
        favour of the labelled-line model in the periphery. The crossfibre <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is an interesting
        historical footnote, she comments.
        Whether this putative link between taste perception and health can be confirmed and
        whether it will be possible to manipulate food preferences to improve health remain to be
        seen. However, it seems certain that, as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five years</TIMEX> will
        see large advances in our knowledge of many aspects of taste, a fascinating and important
        sensory system.
      
      
        What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nextâ</ENAMEX>€”and Why Study Taste Anyway?
        The periphery of the taste sensory system has yielded many of its secrets, but
        relatively little is known about the transduction pathways in taste, how taste cells talk
        to the nervous system, or about events further downstream in the brain. How are signals
        from taste receptors integrated with those from olfactory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to form a
        representation of complex food flavours, for example? With their expanding molecular
        toolbox, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> can now delve deeper into these aspects of taste perception. This may
        tell us not only about taste but about how the nervous system in general is put together,
        says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryba</ENAMEX>.
        But understanding taste is not just an academic exercise. It has practical uses too.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeSimone</ENAMEX> suggests that by understanding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt receptors</ENAMEX>, it may be possible to design
        artificial ligands to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lower their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt intake</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinnamon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">succinctly</ENAMEX> puts it,
        â€˜Can you imagine eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato chips</ENAMEX> and not having the salty component?â€™ An artificial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor ligand</ENAMEX> could make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> a palatable option for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with high
        blood pressure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindemann</ENAMEX> also sees a great future in artificial ligands for taste
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. The sense of taste is partly lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX>, he says, so better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tastantsâ€”effectively â€˜chemical spectaclesâ€™â€”might</ENAMEX> give them back their pleasure of eating
        and thereby improve their quality of life.
        Finally, some aspects of taste may be inextricably tied up with general health, says
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartoshuk</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can taste propylthiouracil are also â€˜supertastersâ€™â€”they have
        more fungiform papillae, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> containing taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>, on their tongues than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-tasters</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supertasters</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables bitterâ€”particularly brassicas</ENAMEX>, like
        Brussel sproutsâ€”so they tend to eat fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> as part of their regular diet than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">non-tasters.</ENAMEX> â€˜Being a supertaster affects your taste preferences, your diet, and ultimately
        your healthâ€™, claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartoshuk</ENAMEX>.
