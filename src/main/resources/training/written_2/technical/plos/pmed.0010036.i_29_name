        The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can dramatically prolong the
        life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> infected by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HIV-1</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], but early hopes
        for virus eradication have not been realized [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The successful use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> is limited by
        drug-related toxicities, high costs, and drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], factors which have led to the
        development of alternative therapeutic strategies, including the use of supervised, or
        structured, treatment interruption (STI). This approach, involving recurrent limited
        exposure to autologous virus, has not been successful in chronic infection [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5</NUMEX>], but has
        been shown to lead to at least transient containment of viremia after intervention in the
        acute phase of infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>-associated retroviruses
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,7,8,9</NUMEX>].
        In the present study, we performed a detailed longitudinal assessment of the impact of
        early treatment followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated during acute or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early HIV-1</TIMEX> infection.
        The main hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection followed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> would lead to immune boosting and subsequent control of viremia without the need for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> copies/ml once or
        above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> copies for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> determinations separated by a week each. The early results of
        this trial were previously reported, showing that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were able to
        achieve a plasma viral load of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> copies/ml or less at a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> mo off therapy [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        The current study investigates the frequency and durability of control achieved with this
        intervention, with follow-up to a median of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 y</NUMEX> after infection, and with an increase in
        size of the cohort to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Our results indicate that, although the majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated in the acute phase of infection go on to control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml plasma for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 6</NUMEX> mo off therapy, the ability to contain viremia below
        this level over the long term is maintained in a minority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Objective
          The hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection would
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">confer</ENAMEX> immunologic maturation and subsequent control of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> without the need for
          ongoing drug therapy. Alternatively, if a breakthrough of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus replication</ENAMEX> was observed,
          this would provide a boost in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific immunity after reinstitution of antiviral
          therapy. The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50,000</NUMEX> copies/ml
          or viral loads above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> determinations separated by a week each.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">secondary</NUMEX> objective was to correlate immunologic and virologic parameters with any
          observed effects including evolution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific T helper and cytotoxic T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lymphocyte</ENAMEX> responses. The original study protocol, including the patient consent form and
          the institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> approval, can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protocols S1â€“S4</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting with acute or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early HIV-1</TIMEX> infection were enrolled in this
          study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between July 1997 and January 2000</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Acute HIV-1 infection was defined by
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 RNA</ENAMEX> in the plasma, a negative or weakly positive HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> by
          HIV-1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/2 ELISA</ENAMEX>, and the detection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than three</NUMEX> bands in an HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western blot</ENAMEX>;
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early HIV-1</TIMEX> infection was defined by a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> and confirmation of early infection
          by either detuned negative ELISA or previously known negative ELISA. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in
          the study had symptoms compatible with the acute <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retroviral syndrome</ENAMEX> and were treated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> protease inhibitor and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two nucleoside</NUMEX> reverse transcriptase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>)
          within a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> d (range, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9â€“33</NUMEX>) from the onset of symptoms. Study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were
          recruited from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts General Hospital</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women's Hospital</ENAMEX>, and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fenway Community Heath Care Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> gave written informed
          consent to participate, and the study was approved by the respective institutional review
          boards and conducted in accordance with the human experimentation guidelines of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Hospital</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were investigated in an interim study [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. These patients
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-02</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AS2</NUMEX> in [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-05</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AS5</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-14</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AS1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-15</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AS3</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-25</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AS6</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-46</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AS4</NUMEX>).
        
        
          STIs
          Entry criteria included treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> before or shortly after HIV-1
          seroconversion, viral suppression on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mo, HIV-1
          viral load at the time of entry into the study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml, and lack of
          significant mutations conferring drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,12</NUMEX>]. Lymphocyte proliferative
          response to recombinant HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p24 protein</ENAMEX> had to exceed a stimulation index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> before
          treatment discontinuation, and net counts per minute had to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> or greater. All
          antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were discontinued simultaneously. After a treatment interruption,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were seen at least once a week for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 wk</TIMEX>, and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>, with a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 30</NUMEX> visits for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> after cessation of therapy. In the second
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, visits continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>. Treatment was restarted if viral load remained above
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml plasma for greater than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive weeks</TIMEX>, or was in excess of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> copies/ml on any single occasion.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Human Leukocyte Antigen Typing</ENAMEX>
          High- and intermediate-resolution human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leukocyte antigen</ENAMEX> class I typing was performed
          at a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynal Biotech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>) by sequence-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> as described [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GB Virus C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB</ENAMEX> virus C (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBV-C</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was detected using a two-step nested PCR amplification reaction
          from whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma RNA</ENAMEX>. Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GBV-C RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from plasma using the Qiagen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viral RNA Mini Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Extracted RNA</ENAMEX> was reverse transcribed using the Qiagen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OneStep</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR Kit</ENAMEX> and amplified by nested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>; in both steps primers specific for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX>€²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTR</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBV</ENAMEX>-C were used, as described previously [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chemokine Receptor Genotyping</ENAMEX>
          In order to analyze the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptor</ENAMEX> (CCR) 5Î”32 deletion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX>, the
          region spanning the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-nt deletion was amplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were
          separated by gel electrophoresis [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR2â€“64I</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> was detected by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCRâ</ENAMEX>€“restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis as described previously [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Synthetic HIV-1 Peptides
          We synthesized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">410</NUMEX> synthetic peptides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15â€“20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Hospital Peptide Core Facility</ENAMEX> on an automated peptide synthesizer using Fmoc
          technology, as described [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Peptides overlapped by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and spanned the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">entire HIV-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">clade</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B 2001</ENAMEX> consensus sequence.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISPOT</ENAMEX> Assays
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISPOT</ENAMEX> assays were carried out as described previously [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Peripheral blood
          mononuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (PBMCs) were incubated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000 to 100,000</NUMEX> cells/well in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well polyvinylidene plates that had been precoated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml anti-human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interferon-Î³</ENAMEX> monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mabtech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>). The final concentration of
          the peptide per well was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml. The numbers of spots per well were counted using an
          automated ELISPOT plate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AID EliSpot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> system, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Autoimmune Diagnostika</ENAMEX>,
          Strassberg, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). A response was considered positive if there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX>
          spot-forming cells (SFCs)/10
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> and if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times the mean number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFCs</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. The dependence of responses on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cells was
          determined by measuring the depletion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Minimacs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> depletion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). When HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell
          responses were detected against adjacent peptides, and therefore might represent
          targeting of the overlap region, responses to the weaker peptide were excluded for
          calculations of magnitude and breadth, as previously described [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proliferation Assays</ENAMEX>
          Freshly isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cells) were incubated with baculovirus-derived recombinant p24
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein Sciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Meriden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> d and
          then pulsed with 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> H thymidine at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> Î¼Ci for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 h</TIMEX> before harvesting as previously
          described [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. A stimulation index of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or</NUMEX> greater was considered significant.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Analysis</ENAMEX>
          Time to failure during the different treatment interruptions was assessed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who were still controlling viremia at the time of last
          visit, who failed because they restarted therapy without meeting the criteria of
          virologic failure, or who were lost in follow-up were included in the analyses, but the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were censored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last evaluable time</TIMEX> point. Equality of survival distributions
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> treatment discontinuations was evaluated using the Wilcoxon
          matched-pairs signed-ranks test. CD4+ T cell losses were calculated on regression lines
          based on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least</NUMEX> squares fit. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards regression model was used for the
          analysis of continuous variables such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> following onset of symptoms, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell
          count, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> viral load, and time to rebound of viremia, as well as for the estimation of
          hazard ratios for the categorical variables of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>, Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blot</ENAMEX>, coreceptor
          polymorphism, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBV</ENAMEX>-C status. Statistical analyses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell responses
          were based on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t</ENAMEX> test, a multiparametric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ANOVA</ENAMEX> test, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> matched-pairs

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> test, as indicated. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were considered to indicate statistical
          significance, and all reported 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided. Statistical analysis and graphical
          presentation were performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prism</ENAMEX> software packages.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of infection (range, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">494â€“2,475</NUMEX> d). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> underwent successive treatment
          interruptions after an initial treatment period of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 8</NUMEX> mo (median, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">508</NUMEX> d; range,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245â€“1,096</NUMEX> d) and were required to restart therapy when viral load exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          copies/ml plasma on a single occasion, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive weeks</TIMEX>.
          For purposes of analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who dropped out of the study or who reinitiated
          therapy without meeting criteria were considered to have lost the ability to contain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viremia</ENAMEX>.
          Using these criteria for reinitiation of therapy and to define failure, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>) were able to achieve virologic control to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml

          but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>) were able to control viremia off therapy at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml plasma for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">y. Duration</ENAMEX> of viremia control during successive
          treatment interruptions was highly variable, and there was no increase in the
          sustainability of viral containment during successive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
          achieving control of viremia for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> y did so during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-10</ENAMEX>), the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-02</ENAMEX>), and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-14</ENAMEX>) treatment interruption, respectively (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). A
          paired comparison (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> matched-pairs signed-ranks test) showed no significant
          difference in the length of viremia control with subsequent treatment interruptions.
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced rebound viremia with discontinuation of therapy, none of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experienced recurrence of symptoms associated with acute HIV-1
          infection.
          These data show that at least transient control of viremia to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          copies/ml plasma was achieved in the majority of study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> during at least one
          of the treatment interruptions, but that durable viral control in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> following
          treated acute infection occurred infrequently. Moreover, the data do not show a
          consistent pattern of augmentation of viral control with sequential treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interruptions</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treatment Interruptions</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">T Cell Counts</ENAMEX>
          Although viral load is a strong predictor of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell loss is
          an additional, independent predictor [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. Early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection led
          to normalization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell counts in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (median, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">753</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ; range, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">492â€“986</NUMEX>), but the effect of treatment interruption was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX>, even in those doing well, as defined by sustained low viral loads. Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> interrupted therapy for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 12</NUMEX> mo, and these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were
          evaluated regarding the effect of treatment interruption on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell loss (Figure 2B
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2C</ENAMEX>). The rate of change in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell counts during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of the longest
          period off treatment ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+157 to âˆ’438</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 /y</ENAMEX> (median, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">âˆ’192</NUMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not meet viral load
          criteria for restarting therapy for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 2 y, one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-02</ENAMEX>) had an increasing CD4+ T
          cell count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">157</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 /y</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-10</ENAMEX>) had a stable CD4+ T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count (âˆ’<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 /y</ENAMEX>) , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-14</ENAMEX>) experienced a decline of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">344</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 /y. Comparison with</ENAMEX> data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MACS</ENAMEX>) showed that the kinetics of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell loss was faster (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> test , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>) than in untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with early chronic HIV-1 infection
          (average loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">âˆ’67</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 /y</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 350</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> at baseline). However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell loss rate was in the same range
          as what has been described after treatment interruption in chronic HIV-1 infection
          [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,23</NUMEX>]. Analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell decline during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          who controlled viremia for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">y</ENAMEX> revealed similar trends in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell slopes,
          although they were less steep: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-02</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+88</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 /y; AC-10</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+44</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 /y</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-14</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">âˆ’110</NUMEX> cells/mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 /y.</ENAMEX> When the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mo off therapy were excluded in order to
          minimize the potential effects of recent treatment on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell number, the rate of
          change in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell counts during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> off therapy no longer differed
          statistically from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MACS</ENAMEX> data (median, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">âˆ’207 cell/mm</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 /y</ENAMEX>; range, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">+119 to âˆ’699</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.07</NUMEX>). A possible reason for steep CD4+ T cell slopes may be high
          CD4+ T cell counts at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of treatment interruption. Comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MACS</ENAMEX> data (Figure
          2C) showed that several of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> still behaved as outliers when this
          factor was considered. These results indicate that periods of relative control of viremia
          were associated with declining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell counts in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Correlation of Clinical and Genetic Markers with Duration of Viremia Control</ENAMEX>
          Although the study was small, we evaluated clinical and laboratory parameters to see
          if any was predictive of duration of viral control. Analyses included clinical and
          laboratory parameters at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of presentation with acute HIV-1 infection, genetic markers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with different rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> progression, and the presence or absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBV</ENAMEX>-C coinfection. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presented with symptomatic acute infection. Time between
          onset of symptoms and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of therapy did not affect duration of control following
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">STI (Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards regression model, 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>0.05</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who controlled viremia for a longer time
          either during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> STI or during any of the treatment interruptions were not
          different from those who experienced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> breakthrough as measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> and
          Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">blot</ENAMEX> status at initiation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX>, coreceptor polymorphisms (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCR5delta32</ENAMEX>, CCR2

          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>0.05</NUMEX> in all comparisons; data not shown). The only parameter
          that was predictive of prolonged viral control during the first treatment interruption
          was a low viremia at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of therapy (
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>): there was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX>-fold increase in hazard per order of
          magnitude increase in viral load. This factor was no longer predictive when the period of
          longest control of viremia was considered. The time to rebound of viremia (><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">copies/ml</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>400</NUMEX> copies/ml) did not correlate with the duration of viral control.
          Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> achieved at least transient control of viremia, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experienced prolonged control, none of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> possessed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA alleles</ENAMEX> B27
          or B57 associated with better disease outcome [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24,25</NUMEX>].

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viremia Control</ENAMEX>
          To assess the relationship between the clinical outcome and evolution of
          HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">longitudinally</ENAMEX> analyzed the breadth and magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell responses using an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interferon-Î³ ELISPOT</ENAMEX> and a panel of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">410</NUMEX> overlapping peptides
          spanning the entire <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> clade B consensus sequence. At the beginning of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> STI,
          HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells were weak (median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">590 SFCs/10</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> PBMCs) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>) and narrowly directed at a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> epitopes
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). CD8+ T cell responses increased significantly (
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.05</NUMEX>) during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> off-treatment period, reaching a median
          total magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,725 SFCs/10</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBMCs</ENAMEX> and targeting a median of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> epitopes, and then were
          sustained when therapy was reintroduced. A further increase in the magnitude and breadth
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific CD8+ T cells was observed in the subsequent off-treatment periods,
          although these augmentations failed to reach statistical significance. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cellâ€“mediated immune</ENAMEX> responses emerging during these consecutive cycles of treatment
          interruption were broadly directed, targeting all structural and most accessory and
          regulatory HIV-1 gene products (data not shown). However, the magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific
          CD8+ T cell responses at the beginning of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.76</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.16</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX>), or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> (
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.55</NUMEX>) treatment interruptions was not predictive of the time the
          study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were subsequently able to stay off therapy according to study
          criteria.
          The periods off treatment allowed for assessment of the relationship between exposure
          to virus and evolution of immune responses. There was a highly significant positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between time until <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virologic failure</ENAMEX> during the first treatment interruption
          and change in the magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific CD8+ T cell responses (
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX>, 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.001</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3C</NUMEX>). Similarly, the longer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> remained off
          therapy during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> interruptions, the greater the augmentation of the
          total magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific CD8+ T cell responses (
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> <<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.016</NUMEX>; 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.74</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>, respectively). The increase in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epitopes</ENAMEX> targeted
          during the first treatment interruption was also linearly correlated to the duration
          until virological failure (
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX>, 
          p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><0.001</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3D</NUMEX>). However, no significant relationship was
          observed between the augmentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epitopes</ENAMEX> targeted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second and third</TIMEX>
          treatment pauses and the time the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were able to remain off therapy in
          the respective treatment interruption. These data suggest that the duration of a
          treatment interruption, and therefore the duration of exposure to plasma virus,
          correlates positively with the magnitude and breadth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific CD8+ T cell
          responses that emerge during off-therapy time periods. Yet, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell responses prior
          to treatment interruptions were not significantly predictive of the duration of time that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are able to spontaneously control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 replication</ENAMEX>, as defined by the study
          criteria.

          Duration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viremia Control</ENAMEX>
          We next analyzed evolution of lymphoproliferative responses to recombinant HIV-1 p24
          Gag <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in order to assess HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell function. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> had
          no detectable response at baseline prior to treatment, consistent with prior reports of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute HIV-1 infection [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. After initiation of therapy, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          generated HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3E</NUMEX>), which was a criterion
          for inclusion in the study. During treatment interruptions, there was a variable decline
          in magnitude, and comparisons between responses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> of treatment
          interruption and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last day</TIMEX> off therapy did not reach statistical significance (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> STI, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX>, respectively). These HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell responses
          also tended to rise with reinitiation of therapy, and some of them were very robust, with
          stimulation indices over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> detected in several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3E</NUMEX>). Similar to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+

        Discussion
        Although early treatment of acute HIV-1 infection followed by treatment interruptions
        may enhance control of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">viremia</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,8</NUMEX>], the durability of this control remains unclear. Here
        we analyzed the long-term impact of initiation of antiviral therapy during acute HIV-1
        infection followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX> in a cohort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Although initial control of viremia
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml plasma was achieved in the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
        studied, a gradual increase in viremia and decline in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell counts was observed in
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, even after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or more of viral containment. Durable virologic control
        occurred infrequently, despite the presence of robust HIV-1-specific CD4+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell
        responses detected by standard assays. Moreover, even during periods of successful control
        of viremia, progressive loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cells was frequently observed. These data indicate
        that although early treatment of acute and early infection is frequently associated with
        transient control of viremia after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX>, ongoing low-level viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">replication</ENAMEX> is associated
        with ultimate virologic breakthrough in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        The standard immunologic assays and virologic assessments in this cohort revealed
        considerable heterogeneity among the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, and did not show a consistent
        pattern in duration of viremia control during successive treatment interruptions. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>) were able to maintain a viral load of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml for at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> d, but progressive loss of control ensued in the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>) were able to maintain control for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2</NUMEX> y. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        did so during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-10</ENAMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-02</ENAMEX>), and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-14</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clinical,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX>, and immunological parameters did not distinguish these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from the
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, nor did they predict the duration of control following treatment
        interruption. Indeed, the longer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was off therapy, the stronger and more broadly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell responses became, but these were still not sufficient to maintain
        prolonged control in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> did not complete the study as
        initially intended (patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-45</ENAMEX> withdrew from the study after viral breakthrough on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first STI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-13</ENAMEX> restarted therapy despite a viral load of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 5,000</NUMEX> copies/ml during
        both the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> STIs and then withdrew, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-05</ENAMEX> restarted therapy prematurely
        during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> STI but then failed to control during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> STI), the results are not
        substantially different if these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> are censored rather than considered to have failed
        to control.
        Loss of viral control in this cohort occurred not only in the presence of strong CD8+ T
        cell responses, but in most cases also in the presence of virus-specific CD4+ T cell
        responses, although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell responses often declined during periods of viremia. In
        addition, total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell numbers were also monitored and declined in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were able to maintain low viral loads for at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">y. Mechanisms</ENAMEX> leading to rapid CD4+ T cell loss need to be further studied in
        future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> trials. Other parameters including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemokine receptor polymorphisms</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GBV-C coinfection</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27,28</NUMEX>] similarly failed to explain the different courses following
        treatment interruption. The only parameter found to be associated with longer control of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viremia</ENAMEX> during the first treatment interruption was a lower viral load at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> of antiviral therapy. Given the multiplicity of comparisons made, the true
        significance of this finding is uncertain.
        The reasons for progressive loss of control despite augmentation of virus-specific CD4+
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell responses remain to be defined. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-06</ENAMEX>), HIV-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superinfection</ENAMEX> in the setting of strong and broadly directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-specific cellular immune
        responses was associated with the loss of viral control, as previously reported [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. No
        other cases of superinfection have been identified in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunologic</ENAMEX> studies performed failed to show an association between increases in viral load
        and loss of immune responses, but this may be due to the use of the current standard IFN-Î³
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> to quantify immune function. Numerous studies now indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-Î³ production
        alone is not associated with viral load [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19,30,31</NUMEX>] but rather that functional
        characteristics of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cells may be better associated with viral control
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,33,34,35</NUMEX>]. Such studies will be important to pursue. In particular, even a low level of
        viremia correlates with a low or undetectable frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">interleukin-2</NUMEX>-producing
        HIV-1-specific memory CD4+ T cells endowed with proliferative capacity in vitro
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36,37,38,39</NUMEX>], thus abrogating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell help crucial to maintain efficacy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell
        functions. In an interim study of a subset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presented here
        (patients <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-02</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-15</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-25</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-46</ENAMEX>), a fully differentiated effector
        phenotype of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific CD8+ T cells for selected epitopes was found to be associated
        with better control of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">viremia</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. Other factors that may contribute include functional
        defects in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific cell-mediated immunity [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,37,40,41,42</NUMEX>], and progressive immune
        escape [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43,44,45</NUMEX>]. HIV-1-specific humoral immunity can also affect viral control after
        treatment interruption [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>], and viral factors including viral fitness [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47,48</NUMEX>] and
        infection with multiple viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variants</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>] can influence viral set point and the rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease progression</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Virus sequencing</ENAMEX> studies currently in progress in this cohort indicate
        that viral breakthrough is associated with sequence changes within and outside known CTL
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> (data not shown). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> evaluation of the relationship between immune escape and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viral</ENAMEX> breakthrough will require extensive additional analyses, including detailed analysis
        of responses to autologous virus [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,51</NUMEX>]. Assessing the changes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell
        functions over time as well as viral evolution under immune selection pressure will be
        important to evaluate immune correlates in this cohort.
        These data are important in light of other recent data on treatment interruption in both
        acute and chronic infection. In chronic HIV-1 infection, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> studies showed only marginal,
        if any, improvements of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> viremia control following a number of treatment interruptions
        cycles, despite at least transient increases in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX>-specific CD8+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T cell
        responses [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,5,52,53,54,55</NUMEX>]. In the setting of infection with a multidrug-resistant virus,
        this strategy may even be deleterious [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX>]. Other studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> after treated acute HIV-1
        infection have shown limited benefits [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], including recent trials such as the PrimSTOP
        trial [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUEST</ENAMEX> study [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX>]. However, little is known about the relationship
        between scheduling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX> and treatment interruptions and the characteristics of viral
        rebound after therapy has been discontinued.
        Although durable control of viremia was not achieved, it is noteworthy that the majority
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were able to achieve transient relative containment of viremia, providing
        rationale for future studies aimed at further enhancing immune control. Early treatment
        alone should still be considered an important therapeutic option. Therapeutic vaccinations
        administered after treated acute HIV-1 infection and before cessation of therapy have given
        disappointing results thus far [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], but the availability of new and more potent immunogens
        requires reassessment of this approach. Indeed, the ability to enhance <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T helper cell
        responses in the chronic phase of infection has been demonstrated [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>], but whether this
        will enhance <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX>+ T cell function requires additional studies. Some promising results have
        been obtained using immunomodulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclosporine</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>] and hydroxyurea
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX>], in combination with antiviral therapy, presumably because of the limitation of T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. Administration of granulocyte-macrophage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>-stimulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> blunted the
        viral rebound following interruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAART</ENAMEX>, and largely prevented a decrease of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX>+ T
        cell counts in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> trial in chronic HIV-1 infection [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX>]. These additional therapeutic
        interventions deserve further investigation in future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> studies.
        Although the present study shows progressive viral breakthrough, it was not designed to
        address whether there might be a change in set point viremia achieved or overall clinical
        benefit through transient early treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acute HIV</ENAMEX> infection. The definition of failure
        chosen for this study was a viral load of greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> copies/ml plasma, which at
        the time the study was initiated corresponded to the level of viremia at which treatment
        was recommended. Larger randomized trials will be needed to determine the potential
        clinical and virologic benefit of approaches based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STIs</ENAMEX>. In studies of untreated
        infection, there is only a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold difference in viremia separating the quartile with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">slowest disease</ENAMEX> progression from the quartile with the most rapid progression [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>],
        suggesting that small differences in steady-state viremia may influence clinical outcome.
        In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STI</ENAMEX> probably should be avoided outside the setting of controlled clinical
        trials. The data in this study may also be relevant to current efforts to develop a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">therapeutic AIDS</ENAMEX> vaccine designed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retard disease</ENAMEX> progression rather than prevent
        infection, since they suggest that durable maintenance of low-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viremia</ENAMEX> may be
        difficult to achieve.
