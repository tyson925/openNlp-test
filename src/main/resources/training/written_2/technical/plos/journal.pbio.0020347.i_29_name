              those the finer, she exhales with the breath of the individual as too costly to

              by painting and repainting them on every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, until at last nature adopts them

        The history of domesticated plant form and function evolves along a two-tiered track
        that doubles back on itself, offering panoramic vistas of natural forces intertwined with
        the creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> of human endeavor (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> have modified the traits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, giving rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX>
        of domesticated breeds that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> form the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of the world's food supply. Modern
        breeds are descendents of the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> from which they were derived. The process of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">domestication</ENAMEX> dramatically changed the performance and genetic architecture of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ancestral species</ENAMEX> through the process of hybridization and selection as originally
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Darwin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX>).
        Despite the low yields and poor eating quality of most wild ancestors and primitive crop
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">varieties</ENAMEX>, these ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of genetic variation continue to provide the basic
        building blocks from which all modern varieties are constructed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Breeders</ENAMEX> have discovered
        that genes hidden in these low-yielding ancestors can enhance the performance of some of
        the world's most productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> varieties. In this essay, I will provide some historical
        context for the paper by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zamir</ENAMEX> in this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zamir 2004).</ENAMEX> I will discuss how ‚Äúsmart breeding‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">recycles ‚Äúold genes‚Äù</ENAMEX> to develop highly productive, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-resistant modern varieties and
        why this approach is particularly attractive to increase food security in regions of the
        world with high concentrations of genetic diversity.
        The job of the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> is to create an improved variety. This may be accomplished
        simply by selecting a superior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> from among a range of existing possibilities, or
        it may require that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> know how to efficiently swap or replace parts, recombine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, and rebuild a biological system that will be capable of growing vigorously and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productively</ENAMEX> in the context of an agricultural environment. How the breeding is done and
        what goals are achieved is largely a matter of biological feasibility, consumer demand, and
        production economics. What is clear is that the surest way to succeed in a reasonable
        amount of time is to have access to a large and diverse pool of genetic variation.
        The process of plant breeding is theoretically simple, but its power resides in the fact
        that it creates novelty. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> generally selects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> for crossing, each of
        which has specific traits or characteristics of interest. The cross provides the mechanism
        by which genes are exchanged between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> so that a wide array of diverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is observed in the progeny of future generations. From a breeding perspective,
        this provides the basis for selection so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> containing the best features of
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can be identified and further bred. By selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that are genetically
        similar, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> restricts the amount of variation that will be evaluated in the
        offspring. On the other hand, by crossing genetically divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, the range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> variation will be much more extensive and can even be surprising, with many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> presenting phenotypes that would not be expected based on the attributes of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Thus, if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> is interested in innovation and wants to generate maximum
        variation from which to make selections, wide crosses are the most productive.
        Not all genetic variation is created equal. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> first introduced the concept of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evolution</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin 1859)</ENAMEX>, he challenged the prevailing view that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were fixed entities
        with a single, invariable genetic identity. The concept of natural selection presupposed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were comprised of genetically variable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> such that selection could
        act on them. The genetic variants differ in the alleles (versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) they carry.
        Alleles that are deleterious in terms of the survival and reproduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> will
        eventually be eliminated while alleles that are favorable or neutral will be perpetuated in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Recombination in natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> allows alleles that may be deleterious
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genetic background to be reassessed in a different genetic context. Over time, the
        alleles that are transmitted at high frequency across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> represent those with a
        substantial likelihood of contributing positively to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s long-term viability in a
        variable environment. For this reason, natural variation is a much more valuable and
        informative reservoir of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for the purposes of plant improvement than would be an
        equivalent number of induced mutations generated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domestication‚ÄîThe Winnowing</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Genetic Variation</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cultivars</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">domesticated</NUMEX> varieties) have been selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> in the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> years
        and inevitably represent a subset of the variation found in their wild ancestors. Cultivars
        are recognizable because they manifest characteristics that are associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domestication</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Unusual or extreme phenotypes, such as large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> size,
        intense color, sweet flavor, or pleasing aroma are often selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and maintained
        in their cultivars for aesthetic reasons, while synchronous ripening or inhibition of seed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shattering</ENAMEX> (a dispersal mechanism) are selected to facilitate harvest. These phenotypes may
        occur in nature but they will frequently be eliminated by natural selection before they are
        fixed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Because of human selection, cultivars may exemplify a range of
        exaggerated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phenotypic</ENAMEX> attributes that give them the appearance of being, on the whole,
        more diverse than some of the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> from which they were derived, but in truth,
        domestication usually represents a kind of genetic bottleneck. Furthermore, cultivars are
        grown in agricultural environments that are generally more uniform than the environments in
        which wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> grow, and this tends to further narrow the gene pool. Thus, while
        cultivars may embody a high degree of obvious phenotypic variation, this may not always be
        a good predictor of the extent of their genetic variation.
        The landrace varieties are the earliest form of cultivar and represent the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in
        the domestication process. Landraces are highly heterogeneous, having been selected for
        subsistence agricultural environments where low, but stable yields were important and
        natural environmental fluctuation required a broad genetic base (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Landraces are
        closely related to the wild ancestors and embody a great deal more genetic variation than
        do modern, high-yielding varieties that are selected for optimal performance within a
        narrow range of highly managed environmental conditions. The value of both the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>
        and the early landrace varieties in the context of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> breeding is that they
        provide a broad representation of the natural variation that is present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> as a
        whole. The fact that natural selection has acted on such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> over the course of
        evolution makes them particularly valuable as materials for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX>. The value added by
        imposing a low intensity of human selection on the early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landraces</ENAMEX> resides in the fact that
        some of these early varieties represent accumulations of alleles that produce phenotypes
        particularly favorable or attractive to the human eye, nose, palette, or other appetites.
        It is also noteworthy that some of these rare or unique alleles or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">allele</ENAMEX> combinations that
        were selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> might never survive in the wild.
        Wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and early landrace varieties have long been recognized as the essential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of genetic variation that will drive the future of plant improvement (Bessey <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Burbank 1914</ENAMEX>). Early plant collections made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai Vavilov</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1887‚Äì1943</ENAMEX>)
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Harlan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1917‚Äì1998</ENAMEX>) inspired the international community to establish long-term
        collections of plant genetic resources that provide modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> with the material
        they need to creatively address the challenges of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Box 1</ENAMEX>). Many may question the
        emphasis on wild and primitive landraces that cannot compete with new, high-yielding
        varieties in terms of productivity or eating quality, particularly in an age when
        biotechnology and genetic engineering promise to provide an endless stream of genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">novelty</ENAMEX>. Indeed, if all forms of novelty were equally valuable, the old varieties would
        hardly be worth saving. But the security of the world's food supply depends on an exquisite
        balance between new ideas and the intelligent use of time-tested resources. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>, more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> before the age of automated sequencing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Harlan</ENAMEX> commented that, ‚ÄúWe are
        not really much interested in conserving the old varieties as varieties; it is the genes we
        are concerned about. The old land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> can be considered as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
        genetic variability is absolutely essential for further improvement. In fact, variability
        is absolutely essential to even hold onto what we already have‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1972a</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Combining Breeding</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Genetics</ENAMEX>
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s world where automated sequencing and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA synthesis</ENAMEX> are mundane activities, it
        may seem contradictory to be worrying about saving or using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúold genes</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Can't new ones be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesized</ENAMEX> to order? Can't we modify a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> at will by introducing a new gene or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> into
        an existing variety? Why should we worry about saving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of historically valuable
        genes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> specimens at great cost to the tax-paying public?
        Perhaps it is not the genes themselves we are now in fear of losing. It is the
        information they encode in all their combinatorial complexity. After all, we are only at
        the very beginning of the endeavor to understand the way in which a genotype confers a
        particular set of attributes to a living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. The subtleties of phenotypic plasticity
        in the face of a changing environment and the layers of genetic redundancy that
        characterize biological systems are largely mysterious. We have only just begun to consider
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of genetic trials and errors that have been evaluated by nature
        over evolutionary time. We cannot even begin to simulate the selective filters that have
        provided us with the diversity of form and function in the living world. We do know that
        living forms of natural diversity are needed to sustain life, and that it would be
        impossible to replace or recreate that diversity if it were lost at this time.
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX>, we know what to do with living forms of genetic diversity. If we keep
        our options open and learn to better utilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> of natural variation that have
        been preserved in our gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and in the few remaining in situ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of wild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and landrace varieties, an almost infinite array of novelty can be achieved using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traditional</ENAMEX>, time-proven practices involving crossing and selection of genes that have
        withstood the test of evolutionary time (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burbank</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>; Hawkes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peloquin 1983).</ENAMEX> By restricting the gene pool, we can readily channel a phenotype into
        a constrained and predictable outcome. By expanding the gene pool, we can open up many new
        possibilities for consideration that have not been previously evaluated, would be unlikely
        to be generated in nature, and would not be readily predicted based on current
        knowledge.
        In crosses between wild and cultivated species of inbreeding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, alleles that were
        ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù during the domestication process may be reintroduced into the cultivated gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX>. This infusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúnew blood‚Äù renews</ENAMEX> and invigorates modern cultivars in surprising
        and interesting ways. It is not uncommon for some of the inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progenies</ENAMEX> derived from
        these crosses to perform better than the better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frey et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976, 1983</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanksley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCouch 1997).</ENAMEX> This phenomenon is known as transgressive variation and results
        from positive interaction between the genotypes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Today, plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> can
        analyze <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> derived from wide crosses using molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> to determine which
        portions of the chromosomes are associated with the transgressive variation of interest.
        This makes it possible to dissect a complex phenotype and to determine where individual
        genes or, more correctly, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) map along the chromosomes.
        Information about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA markers</ENAMEX> linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX> represents a powerful diagnostic tool that
        enables a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> to select for specific introgressions of interest, a technique referred
        to as ‚Äúmarker-assisted selection.‚Äù
        This approach has proven to be extremely successful in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crop species</ENAMEX> (tomato
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bernacchi et al. 1998</ENAMEX>], hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Xiao et al. 1998</ENAMEX>], inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>],

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> introgressions from a wild relative of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> have been associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX>
        increase in the yields of the world's highest-yielding hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng et al. 2004).</ENAMEX> In
        tomato, yield increases of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 50%</NUMEX> resulted from introgressing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> independent
        segments from a wild relative, as reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zamir</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). The effect of these
        introgressions on yield was stable in different genetic backgrounds and in both irrigated
        and drought conditions. This work was facilitated by the availability of a library of
        chromosome segment substitution lines, called introgression lines when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> is a wild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, that provided the foundation for exploring the interactions among the independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QTLs</ENAMEX>. Plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticists</ENAMEX> have long recognized the value of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (Brassica

        utilization of wild and exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">germplasm</ENAMEX> in a breeding program, and they are also an
        efficient reagent for the discovery and isolation of genes underlying traits of
        agricultural importance.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Uncovering the Genes That Underlie Agronomic Traits</ENAMEX>
        Several genes underlying traits of agricultural importance have been cloned using
        substitution lines derived from interspecific or intersubspecific crosses (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song et al. 1995; Frary et al. 2000; Yano et al. 2000; Takahashi et al. 2001</ENAMEX>; Yano

        While the identity of the yield gene conferring the phenotype was not critical to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> of the cultivar development scheme described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zamir</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gur</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), there is
        great curiosity to understand the gene(s) or genes and genetic mechanisms that underlie
        traits of interest to agriculture. In some cases, knowing the gene or the exact functional
        nucleotide polymorphism within the gene that determines the phenotype (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryan et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Robin et al. 2002</ENAMEX>) may dramatically improve the resolution of selection during the breeding
        process. It also may allow a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeder</ENAMEX> to make more informed decisions about which germplasm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to use as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in a crossing program and which genes within those resources to
        use in a pyramiding scheme.
        As more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of interest are cloned and their contributions to complex biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> are better understood, there will be many opportunities for creative synthesis of
        new varieties. It is likely that some of the opportunities will involve genetic engineering
        approaches, where new information about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, gene regulation, and plant responses to the
        environment may be used in innovative ways to fine-tune existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> varieties so that
        they utilize resources more efficiently, provide greater nutritional value, or simply taste
        better.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Variation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Security</ENAMEX>
        The scientific enterprise has always challenged beliefs about the way the world
        functions, its origins, and its possibilities. Deeply held beliefs are frequently resistant
        to the most carefully crafted scientific explanations. When belief systems are unconscious,
        they may prove particularly resilient to change. Occasionally, science provides an
        interpretation that fits cleanly into the framework of existing ideas, and then it is
        heralded with great applause, and often with a sense of relief. When this is not the case,
        public opinion tends to react fitfully, with many starts and stops. Public opinion has been
        on a roller coaster recently with respect to transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in agriculture. This is
        in response to what is perceived to be a kind of scientific intrusion into the intimacy of
        the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and their food supply. This relationship is inherently
        complex, representing a textured fabric of historical, cultural, geographic, economic,
        biological, and aesthetic concerns. Despite the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is increasingly treated as a
        commodity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s global economy, human culture the world over has always recognized
        that food represents more than a biological remedy for hunger. Food is a force that brings
        diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> together, it provides a focal point for human discourse, and it enhances our
        enjoyment of life. Food also has a spiritual component. Harvesting other living organisms
        to support human life represents a powerful connection between different spheres of the
        natural world.
        At some level, the idea of using natural genetic variation found in wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and
        early landrace varieties to revitalize modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> varieties is both emotionally appealing
        and intellectually compelling. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsmart breeding‚</ENAMEX>Äù strategy, it will facilitate the
        exploration and utilization of natural genetic variation, expanding the genetic base of our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop plants</ENAMEX> and providing more flexibility for the future. By using a marker-assisted
        approach, it will provide a noninvasive road map to expedite the selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">introgression</ENAMEX> of
        useful traits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> ahead. Because the approach is primarily useful for
        self-pollinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (as opposed to cross-pollinators), variety development can go
        forward with the expectation that new varieties can be developed and distributed as inbred
        strains. This will come as very good news to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are concerned about the
        infrastructural requirements needed to maintain a hybrid seed industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inbred</ENAMEX> variety seed
        can be saved from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX> without noticeable loss of vigor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmers</ENAMEX> are free to
        amplify the varieties and pass <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> on to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> if it proves valuable. Plant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> living in parts of the world where germplasm diversity is highest are in the best
        position to explore its value. Until now, there have been few opportunities to make use of
        the wealth of natural diversity that abounds in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are the poorest
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is growing the fastest. This approach offers a way forward and can help
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make good use of locally available resources to enhance the food security of their
        own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>.
        As we consider the implementation of smart breeding efforts in the future, we might ask,
        who will have access to nature's reserves of genetic diversity? How will knowledge about
        the patterns that govern the generation and selective elimination of that diversity help
        guide conservation efforts as well as current and future crop improvement efforts? What are
        the limits to biological variation? How far can we push those limits, and what will be the
        consequences of not pushing them? Who will participate in the endeavor? What will the rules
        of engagement be? What tools can we use to expedite the effort?
        What genetic characteristics will help us cope with climate change, global warming, the
        emergence of new pests and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, depleted soils, shortages of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and
        increasing levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and air pollution? What trace minerals, vitamins, and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolites</ENAMEX> will we need to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> of the future to fight the causes of
        hidden hunger, to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, or to enhance the immune system? The combinatorial
        possibilities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> improvement are almost infinite, as long as we maintain our options.
        Faced with a clear choice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, it is obvious that enhancing the potential for genetic
        flexibility in the future is a wise course of action and one we ignore at our peril.
