        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">span</ENAMEX> was first described in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCay et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Since then, similar observations
        have been made in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species including rodents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> flies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, and
        yeast [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>]—and although they are not yet definitive, results from ongoing longevity studies
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> will also extend life span in longer-lived species [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,4</NUMEX>].
        There are many theories explaining the mechanisms by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> extends life span. An
        early hypothesis was that delayed sexual maturation might be a mechanism. However, it has
        since been shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> initiated in older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> also increases life span [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Reduced
        metabolic rate—with consequent reduction in free radical production—was another early,
        leading hypothesis to explain the anti-aging effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX>. But there are many other
        metabolic effects that have been associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX>, including altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> sensitivity
        and signaling, stress resistance, altered neuroendocrine function, and changes in nutrient
        signaling. Any, or a combination, of these biological changes may retard aging. However,
        recent studies seem to favor a highly conserved stress response that evolved early in most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to increase an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s chance of surviving adversity (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX>) by triggering
        concerted physiological responses [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nutrient Composition of Calorie Restricted</ENAMEX> Diets
        Previous studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> have shown that the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> on extending life span are
        dose dependent, with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> reduction in calorie intake producing a smaller increment in
        life span as compared to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> reduction in food intake [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. From this work and others, the
        reduction in calories was recognized to be of paramount importance in the longevity
        response, and alterations in the nutrient content of diets were considered irrelevant.
        However, a recent study in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mair et</ENAMEX> al. challenges this long-held concept of CR
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>].
      
      
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit Flies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodents</ENAMEX>
        In the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mair et al.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> examined life span in fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX> (
        Drosophila melanogaster ) fed one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different diets: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a
        combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> (control), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) restricted in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> only, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) restricted in
        sugar only, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) restricted in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> observed that in the
        restricted sugar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, as compared to the controls, maximal life span was unchanged and
        median life span was increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 12%</NUMEX>. On the other hand, both maximal and median life
        spans were increased substantially in the restricted yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and in the restricted
        yeast and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> claim that total calorie
        contents of the restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast diets</ENAMEX> were similar. Thus, from this
        study it can be implied that restricting carbohydrate is less advantageous than restricting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">protein/lipid</ENAMEX> for mediating the effects of dietary restriction (DR) on life span.
        It is of concern that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> did not directly measure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>' total food intake
        but only estimated intake by examining their feeding behavior. This method may not take
        into account possible differences in the rate of food uptake of restricted flies, which
        could affect the results.
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> have undertaken studies of prolonged calorie restriction in humans
        
        Only a handful of studies have investigated the role of altering nutrient composition on
        longevity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>. The results from these studies have been contradictory, with some
        studies showing no life-span extension following restriction of fat only [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] and others
        showing increased life span following replacement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">casein-protein</ENAMEX> for soy<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-protein</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        However, the concept that it is not just reduced calorie intake that drives the life-span
        extension effect is not new, and the timing of food intake has also been proposed to be of
        importance. For example, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> are fed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day</TIMEX>, improvements in biomarkers
        of aging and increased life span are observed, even though measured calorie intake and body
        weight were not statistically different from ad-libitum or pair-fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,12</NUMEX>]. These
        responses were dependent on genotype and the age at which the protocol was implemented.
        Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> fed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day</TIMEX> had a better response to neurotoxic stressors as
        compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> maintained on prolonged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX>.
        The mechanisms behind the differences in restricting carbohydrate vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>/lipid on
        life-span extension were not examined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mair et al.</ENAMEX> study [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Such mechanisms
        obviously imply the existence of molecular systems in cells that sense
        macronutrients—systems that may respond not only to nutrient availability but also to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hormonal</ENAMEX> response elicited by these dietary nutrients [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. For example, restricting
        dietary carbohydrates increases the plasma concentration of B-hydroxybutyrate (that is,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ketogenesis</ENAMEX>), a shift that may counteract life-span extension in mammals. However, rat
        models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson diseases</ENAMEX> fed a ketogenic diet exhibit increased
        resistance to seizures and have increased protection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neurons</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. Ketogenic diets are
        also prescribed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">epilepsy</ENAMEX>, and although there have been no randomized
        controlled trials, large observational studies (some prospective) suggest that this diet
        does have a beneficial effect on seizures [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>].
        However, it is likely that carbohydrate and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may differentially alter
        nutrient-sensing pathways such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sir2</ENAMEX> and mammalian target of rapomyocin (mTOR), which are
        gaining acceptance as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of the life-span extension effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Sir2 (the
        mammalian homolog is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SIRT1</TIMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide</ENAMEX>-dependent histone
        deacetylase that interacts with numerous transcription factors to silence gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX>. Sir2 is upregulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> and is required for life-span extension effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> in 
        Caenorhabditis elegans (reviewed in [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mTOR</ENAMEX> is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">serine/threonine</ENAMEX> kinase that is activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>, nutrients, and growth factors and is
        a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of ribosome biogenesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, and cell growth. Inhibition
        of mTOR increases life span in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans (reviewed in [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]).
      
      
        Are There <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Implications for Human Life Span</ENAMEX>?
        Obviously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">invertebrate organisms</ENAMEX> cannot serve as reliable models for human longevity,
        and the results by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mair et al.</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>] should not be extrapolated to mammals in general. But if
        this result could be replicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, then the prospect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DR</ENAMEX> to increase life span
        would be eminently more attractive than overall CR. This would mean that a change in food
        patterns could have a similar effect to the dramatic reduction of total food intake.
        However, the life-span extension effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> have not been proven in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and the jury
        is still out on whether nutrient composition will even affect life span in non-human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primates</ENAMEX>.
        In close collaboration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aging</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baton</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Louis</ENAMEX> (all in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) have undertaken studies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prolonged CR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. These studies aim to test the feasibility and safety of different
        types of calorie restricted diets in non-obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and to determine the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> on
        risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">age-related diseases</ENAMEX>, psychological factors, immune function, oxidative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, and molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> identified in lower species [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. These kinds of studies
        will further help identify the mechanisms underpinning the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CR</ENAMEX> or DR on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">longevity</ENAMEX>.
