        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counter</ENAMEX>, spare, strange. Unlike most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and animal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, they do not show a peak of
        species richness towards the equator and a decline towards the poles. This more
        conventional spatial pattern is conveniently known as the latitudinal diversity gradient
        because of the strong covariance of richness and other measures of biodiversity that it
        describes. It is one of the most venerable, well-documented, and controversial large-scale
        patterns in macroecology (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willig et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). Equatorial peaks in species richness have
        characterised the planet since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devonian</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">408‚Äì362 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crame 2001) and</ENAMEX>
        are typical of a wide range of both terrestrial and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (Gaston <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Willig et al. 2003</ENAMEX>). Despite the fact that this pattern has been documented since the late
        1700s, sustained interest in both the regularity of the pattern and its likely underlying
        mechanisms is relatively modern. The realisation that human activity is posing substantial
        threats to biodiversity has quickened the pace of this interest (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willig et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). Where
        the peaks in richness lie (biodiversity hotspots), how these peaks relate to centres of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endemism</ENAMEX> (areas that support large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that occur nowhere else), and how
        these patterns are likely to change through time, especially in the face of major
        environmental change, are major concerns. Without such knowledge, conservation is unlikely
        to succeed.
        Although spatial patterns in biodiversity, and particularly the latitudinal gradient,
        are increasingly well documented for a range of taxa, the proposed mechanisms underlying
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gradients</ENAMEX> remain controversial. In essence, the multitude of mechanisms proposed to
        explain diversity gradients can be reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories: historical, ecological, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">null</ENAMEX>. Most significant in raising the temperature of recent discussions is the question of
        the relative importance of each of these major categories. Historical mechanisms are those
        that suggest that earth history (e.g., the opening of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drake Passage</ENAMEX> and the cooling of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Antarctica</ENAMEX>) and phylogenetic history have played major roles in generating current patterns
        in diversity, and tend to emphasise regional (and especially longitudinal) differences
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ricklefs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricklefs 2004).</ENAMEX> Explanations involving ecological
        mechanisms often downplay the significance of such regional differences and give most
        attention to covariation between current diversity and variables such as energy and water
        availability, and to the ultimate mechanisms underlying this covariation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawkins et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Currie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis 2004).</ENAMEX> By contrast, null <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and specifically the geometric
        constraints model, argue that the expected pattern of latitudinal variation in richness is
        not a uniform <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, but rather a mid-domain peak, which is almost inevitably the outcome of
        the random placement of a set of variable species ranges within a bounded domain (Colwell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2004</ENAMEX>; but see also <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zapata et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). It is deviation from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX>domain
        expectation that is then argued to be of most interest. In many cases the historical and
        ecological mechanisms might be difficult to disentangle, such as the historical effects of
        the establishment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Antarctic Circumpolar Current</ENAMEX>, and its consequences for energy
        availability in the region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke 2003).</ENAMEX>
        Nonetheless, juxtaposing these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major mechanisms raises several questions that
        could substantially inform the debate in many ways, but have enjoyed far less attention
        than debating the relative merits of each of them. The geometric constraints model suggests
        that, to the extent that there is symmetry in the continuity of land (or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) about the
        equator, declines in richness from the tropical peak should also be symmetrical, with any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetries</ENAMEX> in the latter matching those in the former. Indeed, most texts and reviews
        dealing with latitudinal diversity gradients only briefly mention hemisphere-related
        differences and focus instead on the general decline of diversity away from the tropics in
        both directions (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lomolino</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willig et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). However, that
        diversity gradients in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hemispheres</ENAMEX> might in many cases be highly asymmetric has
        long been appreciated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaston 1996).</ENAMEX> Although several historical hypotheses suggest reasons
        why this asymmetry should exist (reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lomolino 1998</ENAMEX>), differences in
        present ecological factors, such as temperature gradients and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> variation, might
        also explain such asymmetry. If ecological factors are important, then these asymmetries
        should show up not only in diversity patterns, but also at other levels in the ecological
        and genealogical hierarchies. From the perspective of ecological explanations for such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> variation, the questions, then, are how common and strong are such asymmetries, how
        common are they in patterns of diversity, and what, if any, might be the ecological, rather
        than null or historical, mechanisms responsible for them?
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continents</ENAMEX> and Climates
        The last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 million years</TIMEX> have seen both a substantial steepening in latitudinal
        diversity gradients and the fragmentation of continental land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crame 2001).</ENAMEX> By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">continents</ENAMEX> had largely assumed their current positions and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">latitudinal</ENAMEX> temperature gradient very similar to the present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> had been established.
        Today, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of all land is in the northern hemisphere, and between latitudes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30¬∞ and 60¬∞</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>, the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to land is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 30¬∞ and 60¬∞</NUMEX> south, it is
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. The continentality of the north and oceanicity of the south have
        considerable effects on the climates of the hemispheres, as has long been appreciated
        (Bonan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). Although there is obviously much local and mesoscale variation, terrestrial
        temperatures in the south (excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX>) are usually warmer, and much less extreme
        in terms of their absolute range, than those in the north (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A</NUMEX>), especially over the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> sites <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 30¬∞ and 60¬∞</NUMEX> typically have mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> temperatures
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 0 and 10 ¬∞C</TIMEX>, whereas at similar latitudes in the north, mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> temperatures
        vary from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">‚àí40 to 0 ¬∞C</NUMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> the smaller range of variation in the south is around a
        physically and biologically significant threshold: the freezing point of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> temperatures are more variable, but generally well below this point. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean</ENAMEX>
        water temperatures are much less variable than those on land, although variability in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ocean</ENAMEX> surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> is much reduced compared with that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> (Figure
        1B).
        Mean annual precipitation is spatially more complex. Overall, precipitation is slightly
        higher in the south than in the north, at least below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60¬∞</NUMEX> latitude. However, much of this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precipitation</ENAMEX> falls over the ocean in the south, leaving the more temperate parts of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> continents as dry as their northern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonan 2002).</ENAMEX> Spatial patterns in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall variability</ENAMEX> are also complex, but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variability</ENAMEX> tends to be higher and
        predictability lower in southern areas. From a biological perspective the significant
        factor is not necessarily just the magnitude of the variance, but also the mean about which
        it occurs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guernier et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        Clearly, the spatial complexity of climatic variation is much greater than the present
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overview</ENAMEX> would suggest. However, these broad brush strokes capture the hemisphere-related
        variation that might be most significant from a biological perspective.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecological Consequences</ENAMEX>
        If differences in climates do cascade upwards to influence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and
        broader scale patterns in diversity, their influence should be readily detectable at the
        level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>' life histories and distributions. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, large-scale geographic
        variation in life history variables, such as the incidence of cooperative breeding, extent
        of parental care, survival, and the timing of reproduction, has been studied for at least
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 50 years</TIMEX>, and the mechanisms underlying this variation have been much debated.
        Taking phylogeny and the idiosyncrasies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> avifauna into account, southern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> typically lay small clutches and have long fledging periods, and it is often
        difficult to predict their date of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> laying or, indeed, whether they will lay in a
        particular year at all (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covas et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell et al. 2004).</ENAMEX> By contrast, northern
        species lay larger clutches and have shorter fledging periods, and laying date is more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">readily</ENAMEX> predicted, making investigations of phenological shifts associated with modern
        climatic change more straightforward (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crick et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>).
        These kinds of differences extend to other taxa. Thus, although the variation of
        metabolic rate with latitude is becoming increasingly well known for a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovegrove</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) has recently suggested, based on comparative work taking both species body
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX> and phylogeny into account, that unpredictability of resources associated with
        considerable inter-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> unpredictability in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> (in turn partly a consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
        Ni√±o‚Äìassociated variability) has been responsible for the evolution of generally low
        metabolic rates in terrestrial mammals of most of the southern continents. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Ni√±o</ENAMEX>
        effects are by no means restricted to these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, it is perhaps low resource
        availability to start off with, associated with considerable unpredictability, that is of
        most significance (see also <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guernier et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>).
        Insect life histories also show hemisphere-related variation. Low-temperature-related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diapause</ENAMEX> is virtually absent in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convey 1996)</ENAMEX>, and metabolic
        rate‚Äìtemperature relationships are much shallower in the south than the north (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Addo</ENAMEX>-Bediako
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">et al. 2002</ENAMEX>). The latter is a consequence of relatively cool growing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> and lack of
        pronounced seasonality in the south. However, the clearest example of a hemispheric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetry</ENAMEX> is that of cold hardiness strategies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinclair et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Insects</ENAMEX> can survive
        sub-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> temperatures either by tolerating internal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> formation or by reducing their
        freezing points to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> formation altogether. Although there is further variation
        within each of these strategies, in general, freeze-avoiding species need to undergo
        substantial preparation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> cold and consequently can take some time to emerge from
        the cold hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. This also seems to be true of strongly freeze-tolerant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that
        can survive freezing far below the point at which they actually freeze. By contrast,
        moderately freeze-tolerant species‚Äîthose that can survive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few degrees</NUMEX> of
        freezing‚Äîappear to need little preparation for a freezing event and seem perfectly prepared
        to continue with their routine activities immediately after thawing. In northern cold
        climate areas, with the exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX>, where extremely low temperatures constrain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> to being strongly freeze tolerant, most cold hardy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> avoid freezing, whereas
        in the south most are moderately freeze tolerant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Microclimates</ENAMEX> reveal why this
        is the case. As might be expected from macroclimatic variation, southern temperate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>
        are faced with regular freeze‚Äìthaw <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> (i.e., variation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0 ¬∞C</NUMEX>), including
        pronounced summer cold snaps, whereas the continental climates of many areas in the north
        mean that once temperatures decline below freezing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, they stay below this
        threshold.
        North‚Äìsouth asymmetries also show up in snowlines, treelines, the frost tolerance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and the proportion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> deciduous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>; K√∂rner <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; K√∂rner
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paulsen 2004).</ENAMEX> Indeed, such differences have long been appreciated for vegetation. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marine</ENAMEX> systems, one of the best-known asymmetries is the low upper thermal limit to
        performance and survival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antarctic</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> ectotherms. This difference in
        limits to survival and performance is characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, invertebrates, and macroalgae
        (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wiencke et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Asymmetries are also apparent in the geographic
        ranges of a wide variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapoport</ENAMEX>'s rule proposes that species
        ranges will be larger at high than at low latitudes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens 1989).</ENAMEX> The pattern is thought
        to be a consequence of considerably greater temporal climatic (and especially temperature)
        variation at high latitudes, and the resulting need for broader physiological tolerances of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. These broad tolerances enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to which these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> belong to
        occur across a wider range of sites than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> at lower latitudes. However, if there is
        much less temporal temperature variation in the south than in the north, evidence for the
        rule should be less forthcoming in the southern hemisphere. This is indeed the case.
        Consistent increases in latitudinal extents with latitude are uncommon in the south, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapoport</ENAMEX>'s rule is now largely considered to be a northern phenomenon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaston et</ENAMEX> al.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>).
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Large-Scale Asymmetries</ENAMEX> in Biodiversity
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Platnick</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) suggested that the world is pear-shaped from a
        biodiversity perspective, with more rapid declines in richness from the equator in the
        northern than in the southern hemisphere, evidence that there are large-scale asymmetries
        in the latitudinal diversity gradient has been accumulating. Seed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> and mammalian
        family richness per unit area declines more steeply in the northern hemisphere than in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaston et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>), and similar asymmetries, mostly at the species
        level, have been noted for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> such as New World <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spiders</ENAMEX>, foraminiferans, and a variety of benthic marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">taxa</ENAMEX> (Platnick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rex et al.</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; Eggleton <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackburn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gaston</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Culver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Buzas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguero</ENAMEX> and Gorla
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Nonetheless, not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> show these trends, and a recent meta-analysis, albeit
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on a relatively coarse scale, failed to find consistent north‚Äìsouth differences in
        latitudinal gradients (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillebrand 2004).</ENAMEX> Recent reviews, particularly of marine diversity,
        have pointed out the difficulty of making comparisons of this kind owing to sampling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constraints</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnston 2003).</ENAMEX> However, it remains remarkable that even simple
        exercises‚Äîsuch as plotting richness values for different latitudes or latitudinal bands
        against each other for the hemispheres and examining the resulting relationship, or
        overlaying them on the same range of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">latitudes‚Äîrarely</ENAMEX> appear in the literature. Thus, it is
        not yet clear how common or strong hemisphere-related asymmetry is.
        By contrast, it appears that proximate ecological correlates of diversity gradients
        differ considerably between north and south. Although both historical and ecological
        factors have led to variation in the numbers and identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> across the globe
        (Ricklefs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>), climate, and particularly energy and water availability, is a strong
        predictor of broad-scale patterns in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species richness</ENAMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. However,
        the extent to which energy and water availability constrain species richness varies. In a
        recent comparative analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawkins et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) showed that water availability is the
        key limiting component of richness for the southern hemisphere, but for temperate regions
        of the north, energy availability is more important (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). They ascribe this
        difference to the warmer and less thermally variable conditions of the southern hemisphere,
        which, as we have already noted, have considerable effects on species life histories.
        Of course, biodiversity is not just species richness, but also encompasses the
        ecological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> of which species are a part. Although potential north‚Äìsouth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asymmetries</ENAMEX> in interactions have not been widely explored, recent work is providing
        tantalising glimpses of such variation. Thus, it appears that on the basis of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX> (not phylogenetically corrected) comparative analysis, specialisation in
        plant‚Äìpollinator relationships is much greater in the south than in the north. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> are typically visited by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, whereas in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern Africa</ENAMEX> the median is a single pollinator <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> per species of orchid (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner 2003)</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Insect‚Äìplant interactions might also vary in other ways
        between the hemispheres, as the rarity of showy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> colours and the paucity of aphid
        species‚Äîwhich are thought by some to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> of these displays (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archetti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX>

        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flux</ENAMEX>
        Despite considerable spatial complexity, there do seem to be regular north‚Äìsouth
        differences in species life histories and patterns of range size variation that are
        consistent with disparities in the climates of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hemispheres (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These
        differences extend to the proximate ecological mechanisms underlying spatial variation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species richness</ENAMEX>, and, in some cases, apparently to ecological interactions. However, what
        is less clear is the regularity and strength of north‚Äìsouth differences in spatial
        diversity patterns, and especially the latitudinal gradient in diversity, as well as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> in which abiotic variation between the hemispheres might extend through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genealogical</ENAMEX> and ecological hierarchies to effect such differences. Indeed, if the extent
        to which abiotic differences between the hemispheres influence biodiversity patterns is to
        be better comprehended, several key issues deserve attention.
        First, both phylogenetically independent and non-independent comparisons of life history
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traits</ENAMEX> and physiological variables across a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are required. Contrasting
        these approaches will provide considerable insight into how much of the signal is based on
        phylogenetic patterns, and how much on current ecological responses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whilst</ENAMEX> in some cases
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> may be obtained from the literature, it is likely that new work will have to be
        undertaken, especially in the southern hemisphere, where the number of past investigations
        of such traits is generally much lower than in the north. Moreover, replicated studies
        using similar methods might substantially improve the signal-to-noise ratio, which can be
        weakened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúmacrophysiological‚</ENAMEX>Äù or large-scale life history and physiological comparisons
        by the fact that different methods often lead to different outcomes.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, there is much to be said for the application of similar methods to
        investigations of large-scale, hemisphere-related patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species interactions</ENAMEX>.
        Differences like those in plant‚Äìpollinator systems discussed here might extend to other
        interactions in marine and terrestrial systems. Contrasting phylogenetically independent
        and non-independent comparisons are likely to provide much insight into the reasons for
        those asymmetries that are found.
        Finally, comparisons of latitudinal gradients and their underlying correlates in the two
        hemispheres for the same taxon, sampled using similar methods, and investigated with
        methods that take cognisance of likely confounding effects are required. This approach will
        provide a means of determining whether asymmetries in the climates of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hemispheres
        really do translate into differences in biodiversity patterns. Such an approach goes to the
        heart of the question of the processes underlying the latitudinal gradient in species
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richness</ENAMEX>, and could go a considerable way to teasing apart the importance of historical,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecological</ENAMEX>, and null explanations, and identifying the mechanisms that underlie them.
        In our view, clarifying these issues is of considerable importance. What is at stake is
        not a set of arcane ecological questions, but rather questions that are central to
        determining whether ecological and conservation lessons learnt in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area can be applied
        more broadly. For example, it has been suggested that climate change will cause substantial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extinctions</ENAMEX> in the near future (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). Indeed, responses by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to such
        change, via phenological shifts and northward movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> range margins, are well
        documented for northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hemisphere species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parmesan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yohe 2003).</ENAMEX> However, if there are
        substantial differences in abiotic environments such that patterns in diversity and their
        responses to change differ between hemispheres, then such shifts may not be of similar
        consequence in the south. To date, southern hemisphere studies represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> of
        the total in this field (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Root et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>), suggesting that it is not at all clear how the
        considerable biodiversity in the south will respond to future change. We find such a
        situation extraordinary. Thus, whilst penguins might at first appear counter, spare, and
        strange, they serve as a reminder that differences between the north and south might not be
        so much strange, as remarkable and worthy of closer attention.
