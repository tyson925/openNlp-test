        of them have been described, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX>, type I diabetes (also called
        insulin-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes mellitus</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX>, and systemic lupus erythematosus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>) are among the most common. Although tremendous progress has been made in disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>, cures for these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> have not yet been found.
        Consequently, a large research effort is sustained in this field. In addition, autoimmunity
        has intrigued basic immunologists since the early realization that the ability to
        discriminate self from non-self was at the core of the immune system's ability to protect
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> from pathogens while avoiding self-destruction. A failure of this mechanism
        results in autoimmune reactions that often lead to clinical disease. In spite of massive
        research efforts, the mechanisms by which autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> develop are not clearly
        understood. Genetic predisposition as well as environmental triggers plays a role, but the
        identity of these factors has been largely elusive. The identification of the most common
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> and environmental factors that set off autoimmunity may lead to a better
        understanding of the ensuing pathogenesis, and offers the best hope for improved therapies,
        and ultimately, cures.
        So far, animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have proved the best way to probe the mechanisms of disease in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, and autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in particular. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few decades</TIMEX>, the mouse has
        become the model of choice for experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> is following close
        behind. Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early twentieth century</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>), the production of inbred strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and the systematic
        collection and characterization of naturally occurring mutants have created the building
        blocks on which much of the research using animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is now based. Inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> are
        collections of genetically identical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> obtained through selective breeding. These
        strains have provided homogenous experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, with interindividual variability
        reduced to environmental (and stochastic) factors. In addition, inbred strains have an
        assortment of distinct phenotypes that have then been exploited as models of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, techniques have been developed to manipulate the mouse genome. Specific
        genes now can be routinely over-expressed as transgenes, or eliminated by gene targeting,
        which creates a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“knockout”</ENAMEX> (Smithies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wassarman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DePamphilis 1993).</ENAMEX> This approach,
        known as reverse genetics, has shown itself to be a powerful tool with which to evaluate
        the role of individual genes in various biological processes. The use of genetically
        engineered mouse models will likely play a major role in deciphering the function of a
        multitude of new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> revealed in the recently completed sequence of the mouse genome
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
        Interestingly, the percentage of mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> without any homolog currently detectable in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> (and vice versa) has been estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX>, a fact that
        strengthens the validity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models of human diseases. However, one has to be careful
        in directly applying data obtained from animal models to human diseases. Most human
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> show an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation, which animal
        models present as simplified versions. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model, as in any reductionist approach, is
        both inconvenient, because it provides only a partial representation of the real biological
        complexity underlying the human disease, and advantageous, because it is a more tractable
        tool with which to probe mechanistic issues. In addition, a number of differences exist
        between the human and rodent immune systems (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mestas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hughes 2004).</ENAMEX> Since immune
        dysfunctions are at the root of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, such differences may limit
        extrapolations from animal models to autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Nonetheless, animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are at the core of autoimmune research, and a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
        literature reflects the many advances brought by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in terms of deciphering
        disease mechanisms. The relative lack of progress in certain human autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> for
        which an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model does not exist, such as neuropsychiatric lupus, corroborates the
        indispensable role played by animal models. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> basic types of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have been
        used in autoimmune research: spontaneous models, induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and genetically engineered
        models. The latter category has been further subdivided into transgenic and knockout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strains</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spontaneous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were produced through fortuitous observations of clinical symptoms
        reminiscent of a given human autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> developing in a given mouse strain, or in
        crosses between mouse strains. This happened, for example, with the nonobese diabetic (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOD</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, which developed type 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, and the hybrid between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Zealand Black</ENAMEX> (NZB)
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Zealand White</ENAMEX> (NZW) mouse, (NZB × NZW)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">F1</TIMEX>, which developed a lupus-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        Unfortunately, spontaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are not available for all human autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have created induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, often by exposing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to high
        doses of a suspected autoantigen at the same time as stimulating the immune system.
        Interestingly, marked differences exist between strains in their responses to these
        autoimmune inductions that reflect genetic variation associated with susceptibility to
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. For this reason, induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have been limited to a small number of
        strains. For example, experimental autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">encephalomyelitis</ENAMEX> has been widely used as a
        model of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, spinal cord homogenate or a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> derivative
        such as myelin basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is injected with a mixture of potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunostimulants</ENAMEX>, most
        commonly in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> from the SJL strain. Another example of an induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX>-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, which has been used to study rheumatoid <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>. In this
        model, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II collagen</ENAMEX>, a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX>, is injected also with immunostimulants, most
        commonly into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/1</ENAMEX> strain.
        Finally, the ability to turn specific genes on or off, in specific cell types and/or at
        specific times, has created a plethora of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models limited only by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunologist</ENAMEX>'s
        imagination. Genes suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> have been evaluated this way, and those studies have been very informative in
        mapping out functional pathways that are targeted in these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. However, these models
        have intrinsic problems that have become more apparent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>, and require
        careful controls to avoid possible misinterpretation. These problems are a result of the
        fundamental way in which transgenic and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">knockout strains</ENAMEX> are produced. When a piece of DNA
        carrying the gene of interest is injected as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“transgene”</ENAMEX> into fertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, it
        integrates randomly into the genome, and in doing so, potentially modifies the expression
        of the gene it integrates into. Since all genetic studies have recognized that a large
        number of genes are involved in autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> susceptibility, the potential for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> to hit one of those susceptibility <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is not negligible. This potentially
        confounding factor is usually controlled by producing and comparing several independent
        transgenic lines.
        More problematic is the interpretation of results obtained with knockout models. A gene
        is “knocked out” (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KO</ENAMEX>) by homologous recombination of a disrupting piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> within that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. This genetic manipulation takes place in embryonic stem (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX>) cells, which once
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutated</ENAMEX>, are introduced into the inner cavity of a blastocyst (very early mouse embryo),
        creating chimeric embryos that are put back into female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that carry the pregnancy to
        term. After multiple trials (and errors), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ES</ENAMEX> cell lines from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> strain and blastocysts
        from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57BL/6</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B6</NUMEX>) strain have shown themselves to be superior in terms of efficiency
        and reliability. Consequently, this strain combination is at the origin of the overwhelming
        majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">knockout strains</ENAMEX>. Although the chimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> are usually backcrossed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">B6</NUMEX> to
        dilute the contribution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> genome, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">knockout strains</ENAMEX> are always a mixture of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genomes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Most importantly, a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> flanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KO gene</ENAMEX> remains of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> origin, unless extreme measures are taken to select for recombination between tightly
        linked markers. There have been sporadic reports of phenotypes initially attributed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> in the expression of a given gene that disappeared with additional backcrosses
        to B6. The only possible interpretation was that these phenotypes were in fact due to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX>
        alleles that were replaced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B6</TIMEX> alleles with further backcrossing.
        The production of autoantibodies and mild <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-related renal pathology, highly
        relevant to autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>, has been reported independently in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        mouse models using the (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">129 × B6</ENAMEX>) genetic background (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obara et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botto et al</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bickerstaff et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago-Raber et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). It is generally accepted that genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> is conferred by multiple highly interactive genes
        that have small individual effects. In this context, the autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phenotypes</ENAMEX> resulting
        from the combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX> genomes may might therefore provide a primed
        background upon which the effects of deficiency in the target gene can be amplified. On the
        other hand, the autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">phenotype</ENAMEX> may be overwhelmingly contributed by the (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">129 × B6</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> combination, with little if any effect of the deficiency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KO gene</ENAMEX>.
        In this issue of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Biology</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marina Botto</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have tested this
        hypothesis by taking one of their knockout models for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX>, the serum amyloid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> component
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deficient mouse</ENAMEX> (
        Apcs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">−/−</ENAMEX> ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bygrave et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has published that 
        Apcs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">−/</ENAMEX>− <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on a (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">129 × B6</ENAMEX>) genetic background develop a lupus-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, even after repeated backcrosses to B6 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bickerstaff et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). Serum amyloid P
        component binds to debris generated from dying cells. Efficient removal of this debris has
        been shown to be critical to the prevention of the production of autoantibodies against
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> material. 
        Apcs was therefore an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene to evaluate. 
        Apcs , however, is located in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> near the tip of mouse Chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        that is rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> susceptibility loci and in genes that have been directly associated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SLE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wakeland et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). As mentioned above, the 
        Apcs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">−/</ENAMEX>− <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, although on a mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B6</ENAMEX> genomic background, has its entire 
        Apcs flanking region replaced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> alleles. In a critical experiment,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> compared the autoimmune phenotypes of 
        Apcs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">−/</ENAMEX>− <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to congenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (i.e., genetically identical, except for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> of interest), carrying the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> region on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chromosome 1</ENAMEX>, but expressing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apcs</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amazingly</ENAMEX>, no difference was found between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains
        regarding the production of autoantibodies, clearly eliminating 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Apcs deficiency</ENAMEX> as a mechanism for this autoimmune process. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Apcs deficiency</ENAMEX> was however associated with markedly increased renal
        damage, suggesting that this gene may be involved in preventing pathological consequences
        of autoantibody production.
        It has been reported anecdotally that the most common outcome of a genetic knockout is a
        lupus-like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botto</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> may have identified the reason behind this
        somewhat surprising observation as a spurious consequence of the gene-targeting process.
        Gene targeting has been an invaluable tool in understanding the mechanisms of immunological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, and has still a very important role to play with increasingly sophisticated
        techniques of selective targeting. The immediate consequence of this work should be an
        increased scrutiny for appropriate controls, which may include congenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> carrying the
        same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> flanking region, but expressing the targeted gene (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The past few years</TIMEX> have shown that genetic susceptibility to autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>
        involves a large number of genes with small individual contributions. In spite of this
        great complexity, advances have been made, and a small but growing number of susceptibility
        genes have been identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morahan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morel 2002).</ENAMEX> A common trait shared by successful
        studies has been the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models, either directly or indirectly. As the pace of
        genetic analysis increases in autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, and powerful tools have been created to
        navigate between the mouse and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomes</ENAMEX>, the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> models has been reaffirmed
        at multiple levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are used to discover new susceptibility genes that can
        then be assessed in patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, as well as to validate genes that have been
        directly identified in human genetic studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are also used to perform
        detailed functional and physiological analyses that cannot be conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Finally,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mouse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have been invaluable to screen disease-specific therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
        Using mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> has its pitfalls; many differences, both obvious and subtle, exist
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Those differences are, however, outweighed by the power of the
        experimental system offered by the mouse. What the new study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>
        reminds us is that the appropriate control is still crucial to meaningful data
        interpretation. Keeping that in mind, one can predict that many of the keys to human
        autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> are still in the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
