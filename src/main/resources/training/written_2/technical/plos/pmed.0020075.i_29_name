        Uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells is a hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. In many types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, mutations in genes that activate cellular signal transduction <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pathways</ENAMEX> contribute
        to enhanced proliferation and survival of cancer cells. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> well-characterized example is
        mutation in tyrosine kinases, enzymes that regulate the growth and survival of cells.
        Tyrosine kinase activity is tightly regulated in normal cells, but is dysregulated due to
        mutation in some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, including lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, resulting in enhanced proliferation and
        survival of cancer cells. The tyrosine kinases are attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for molecularly
        targeted therapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> become dependent on growth signals from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine kinases require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> for their enzymic activity, and thus
        small molecules that mimic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> can bind to mutant kinases and inactivate them.
        The paradigm for tyrosine kinase inhibition as treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> using small-molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> was first established in the context of chronic myelogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the 
        BCR-ABL gene rearrangement [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imatinib</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gleevec</ENAMEX>), a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-phenylaminopyrimidine</TIMEX>, is a competitive inhibitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABL</ENAMEX> kinase,
        thereby inhibiting the constitutively activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BCR-ABL</ENAMEX> tyrosine kinase. Imatinib induces
        complete remission in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX> in stable phase [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], and also has activity in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX> that has progressed to blast crisis [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imatinib</ENAMEX> is also a potent inhibitor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGFRA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGFRB</ENAMEX> tyrosine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinases</ENAMEX>. As a consequence, there have been additional dividends from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval of imatinib for treatment of BCR-ABL-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX>. For
        example, imatinib is effective in treatment of chronic myelomonocytic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> with gene
        rearrangements that constitutively activate 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGFRB</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>], of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypereosinophilic syndrome</ENAMEX> with activating mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGFRA</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], and of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors associated with
        activating mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIT</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>] (all reviewed in [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]).
        More recently, this paradigm has been extended to treatment of non-small cell lung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (NSCLC). Several mutations have been identified in the context of 
        epidermal growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor</ENAMEX> (EGFR) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> that are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with clinical response to the small-molecule EGFR <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors gefitinib</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iressa</ENAMEX>)
        or erlotinib (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarceva</ENAMEX>) [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8,9</NUMEX>], including in-frame deletions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L747–E749;A750P</ENAMEX> in
        exon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">L858R</NUMEX> in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>. Although responses are often dramatic, most responding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ultimately develop clinical resistance and relapse of disease [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,8,9</NUMEX>]. The basis
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> had not been known, in part owing to the difficulty in obtaining tissue from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-biopsy at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of relapse.
      
      
        Resistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Small-Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        As might have been anticipated in treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> with any single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, resistance
        to small-molecule tyrosine kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> has emerged as a significant clinical problem.
        This was first appreciated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX> treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">imatinib</ENAMEX> whose tumors
        developed resistance, and has been most extensively studied in that context. Although there
        are many potential mechanisms for development of clinical resistance, most cases of
        imatinib-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX> are due to point mutations in the 
        BCR-ABL kinase domain itself, including T315I [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11</NUMEX>]. Similar mutations
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous residues</ENAMEX> of the kinase domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGFRA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T674I</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T670I</NUMEX>) account
        for imatinib resistance in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypereosinophilic syndrome</ENAMEX> and
        gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors, respectively [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,12</NUMEX>]. These findings suggest
        strategies to overcome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> that include the use of alternative small-molecule
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>. Indeed, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years</TIMEX> after the recognition of imatinib resistance
        mutations in BCR-ABL-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CML</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are now in clinical trials that are potent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of imatinib-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BCR-ABL mutants</ENAMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,14</NUMEX>].
      
      
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Basis for Resistance to Small-Molecule EGFR Inhibitors</ENAMEX> in NSCLC
        In an elegant new study in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pao</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have identified acquired mutations in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> that appear to explain clinical resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. The mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was acquisition of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> substitution
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> that was not present at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of diagnosis, but was detected with progression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> after initial response to gefitinib or erlotinib. T790M in the context of either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> expressed wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGFR</ENAMEX> or the mutant alleles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L474–E749;A750P</ENAMEX> or L858R
        impairs inhibition by gefitinib or erlotinib as assessed by autophosphorylation.
        Furthermore, the NSCLC cell line <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H1975</NUMEX> harbors both <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L858R and T790M</TIMEX> mutations, and is
        resistant to inhibition by gefitinib or erlotinib, unlike cell lines that express the L858R
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX> alone. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H1975</TIMEX> cell line, it was possible to obtain adequate quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
        to confirm that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L858R and T790M</TIMEX> mutations are present on the same allele, as would be
        predicted if T790M confers resistance to inhibition of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L858R</NUMEX> allele.
        Structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of EGFR provide structural insights into these biological data. A
        ribbon structure of erlotinib bound to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> kinase domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) shows the
        threonine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">790</NUMEX> in green and the positions of the exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> and L858R
        gain-of-function mutations. Substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 would
        be predicted to result in steric hindrance of erlotinib binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        These observations provide convincing evidence that, at least in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX>, resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib can be attributed to acquisition of a T790M
        mutation in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with clinical
        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib did not have the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T790M</NUMEX> mutation, nor did they have
        mutant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRAS</ENAMEX> alleles that have previously been shown by these same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> to
        confer resistance to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. Thus, mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> are
        heterogeneous.
      
      
        Next Steps, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lessons Learned</ENAMEX>
        It will be important to identify alternative small-molecule <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> for the T790M
        resistance mutation. Structural data suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>, lapatinib, may subserve
        this purpose [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], but it has not been tested for biological activity in this context. New
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> screens and/or rational drug design to identify alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> of this small cohort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> with clinical
        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the T790M</TIMEX> substitution. Efforts to identify
        alternative mechanisms for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> may be guided by experience with imatinib resistance
        in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCR-ABL</ENAMEX>, and should include full-length sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> to identify
        other resistance mutations, and analysis for evidence of gene amplification, as well as
        investigation of other well-characterized mechanisms of drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> such as drug efflux
        or increased drug metabolism.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pao</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>' superb study also highlights several important points that may guide
        development of kinase-targeted therapies in the future. It is clear that, to the extent
        that small-molecule kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are effective as single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in treatment of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> will develop. Furthermore, based on previous experience, some of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are likely to harbor acquired point mutations in the target kinase that confer
        resistance. Resistance mutations identified via in vitro screens have shown a high degree
        of correlation with those that develop in vivo, as shown in screens for imatinib-resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BCR-ABL mutants</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">PKC412</NUMEX>-resistant FLT3 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], as well as the T790M
        resistance mutation to gefitinib in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGFR</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Thus, in vitro screens for
        mutations that confer resistance to kinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are warranted, followed by efforts to
        identify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that overcome resistance. This proactive approach should shorten the time
        frame for new drug development.
        These findings also emphasize the critical need for re-biopsy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cancer
        treated with molecularly targeted therapies at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of relapse. Tissue acquisition is more
        challenging in solid tumors than for hematopoietic malignancies, and may entail risk.
        Nonetheless, it is clear that data derived from such analyses will be essential to inform
        approaches to improving therapy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSCLC</ENAMEX> and other solid tumors.
