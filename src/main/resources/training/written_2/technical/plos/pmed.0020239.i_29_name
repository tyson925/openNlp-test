        proclaimed that the turnaround was a testament to the efficient response of health systems
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX> and justified its decisive action in issuing a global alert.
        That swift response was partly due to infectious disease <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> being able to use
        models of disease spread, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SARS</ENAMEX> was a newly emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, to help plan their
        next move. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epidemiologists</ENAMEX> have used mathematical models to predict and understand
        the dynamics of infectious diseases for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 200 years</TIMEX>. The emergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ebola</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SARS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> virus, and multi-drug-resistant malaria—as well as the
        potential for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> to be introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bioterrorism—has</ENAMEX> attached even greater
        importance to this management tool.
        Models are used to provide information on such infections and predict the effect of
        alternative courses of action. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Wearing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> suggest, however, that many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">off-the-shelf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are inappropriate for making quantitative predictions because
        substantial biases have been introduced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important, yet largely ignored, assumptions.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> warn that if such biases are not corrected, health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> risk making
        overly optimistic health policy decisions.
        They begin with the “SEIR” <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host population</ENAMEX> is classified
        according to infectious status, i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are susceptible, exposed, infectious, or
        recovered. This model assumes that the rate of leaving the exposed or infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>, irrespective of the time already spent in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. Although mathematically
        convenient, this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent (incubation) and
        infectious periods, which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections, say the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, who suggest instead that it would more sensible to specify the probability of
        leaving a class as a function of the time spent within the class. Hence, initially, the
        chance of leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> is small but then increases as the mean infectious/incubation
        period is reached. This assumption would give a more realistic distribution of incubation
        and infectious periods.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> also note another issue that has received surprisingly little attention in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infectious disease</ENAMEX> models, namely, the influence of incubation and infectious period
        distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible
        population—despite its obvious application to emerging infections and possible “deliberate
        exposure.”
        The impact of these differences on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> could translate into potentially important
        public health concerns, say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>. They tested their theory by using analytical
        methods to show that, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, ignoring the incubation period or, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, assuming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exponentially</ENAMEX> distributed incubation and infectious periods (when including the incubation
        period) always resulted in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection
        from outbreak data. They then illustrated these points by fitting epidemic models to data
        from an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza</ENAMEX> outbreak. Their results suggested that within a strict management
        setting, epidemiological details could make a crucial difference.
        Although previous studies have shown the importance of using realistic distributions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> and infectious periods in endemic disease models, few studies have considered
        the effects associated with making predictions for an emerging disease. Discrepancies
        between estimates of reproductive ratio from exponentially distributed and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-distributed fits confirm the need to have precise distributions of incubation and
        infectious periods. Although such data are available from post hoc analyses of epidemics,
        they are lacking for novel emerging infections. The key point is that uncertainty about
        these distributions should be incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> when making quantitative
        predictions.
        The take home message is that when developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> for public health use, policy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> need to pay attention to the intrinsic assumptions within classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> note that while some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> are using their approach, most applied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies still use models that incorporate exponentially distributed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX> and infectious periods; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> hope their work will point to the next steps
        in delivering quantitatively accurate epidemiological <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>.
