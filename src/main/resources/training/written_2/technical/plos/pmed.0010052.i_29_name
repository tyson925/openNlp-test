        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perfection</ENAMEX> has come in for a lot of bad press recently. A torrent of books and articles
        has recently appeared [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9</NUMEX>], all raising serious ethical questions about the
        wisdom and morality of trying to use biomedical knowledge to perfect ourselves or our
        offspring.
        Biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> might be inclined to ignore this literature as just
        so much abstract philosophical handwringing. After all, it is almost impossible to find
        mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> arrogant enough to proclaim their interest in perfecting anything,
        much less themselves or their fellow human beings.
        Beating up on the pursuit of perfection is silly. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvadore Dali</ENAMEX> famously pointed
        out, ‚ÄúHave no fear of perfection‚Äîyou'll never reach it.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Critics</ENAMEX> of those who allegedly
        seek to perfect human beings know this. While often couching their critiques in language
        that assails the pursuit of perfection, what they really are attacking is the far more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">oft-expressed‚</ENAMEX>Äîalbeit far less lofty‚Äîdesire to improve or enhance a particular behavior or
        trait by the application of emerging biomedical knowledge in genetics, neuroscience,
        pharmacology, and physiology. Those who might accurately be termed ‚Äúanti-meliorists‚Äù wonder
        how we will ever resist the obvious temptation to put this knowledge to use to alter
        ourselves. They are quick to note that we have already given in to such temptation‚Äîwe
        augment our breasts, smooth our wrinkles, and pump ourselves full of antidepressants.
        Putting the brakes on biologically driven human betterment would have real consequences
        for science. Some lines of research would be slowed or restricted [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,5,8</NUMEX>]. Their
        application would be declared off-limits or at least tightly regulated
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9</NUMEX>].
        Why is the drive to improve ourselves so disturbing to the anti-meliorists? Their
        arguments cluster around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> key worries: that the pursuit of perfection by biomedical
        means is vain, selfish, and unrewarding [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,2,3,6,7</NUMEX>], that improving ourselves is unfair
        [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,3,4</NUMEX>], and that enhancement or improvement violates human nature [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4,5,7,8,9</NUMEX>] and may
        actually destroy it [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,5,7,9</NUMEX>]. It is the last of these arguments that is at the core of
        anti-meliorist concerns.
        It cannot simply be the pursuit of improvement that is making anti-meliorists nervous.
        Many religious traditions and spiritual movements seek perfection [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,11,12,13</NUMEX>], but these
        evoke no negative commentary from the anti-meliorists. Nor do efforts to improve animals
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> set this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> aflutter. Rather, it is biomedical knowledge being applied to you
        and me that is the crux of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. They fear that in applying new biomedical
        knowledge to improve human beings, something essential about humanity will be lost. If
        biomedical tinkering is allowed, we will destroy the very thing that makes us human‚Äîour
        nature.
        Anti-meliorism rests, however, on a very shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>. To support their position,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-meliorists</ENAMEX> must state what human nature is. They do not. They must also be very
        clear about why they see human nature as static. They are not. And they must advance an
        argument about why human nature, which has presumably evolved in response to an enormous
        array of random <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, tells us anything about what is good or desirable in terms of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traits humans</ENAMEX> should possess. They cannot.
        The fight over whether there is any such thing as human nature is a long-standing one
        [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]. But one can concede that we are shaped by a causally powerful set of genetic
        influences and still remain skeptical as to whether these produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single ‚Äúnature‚</NUMEX>Äù that
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of humanity possess. Is there a single trait or fixed set of traits that
        defines the nature of who we are and have been throughout our entire existence on this
        planet? Unless they can articulate this Platonic essence, anti-meliorists do not have a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for their argument that change, improvement, and betterment are grave threats to
        humanity.
        Worse still for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-meliorists</ENAMEX>, we are clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> who have long tinkered with
        ourselves, using all manner of technologies from clothing to telescopes to computers to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airplanes</ENAMEX>. Our view of our ‚Äúnature‚Äù is closely linked to the technologies that we have
        invented and to which we have adapted [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. We are already technological <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>.
        Nor is there any normative guidance offered by our evolutionary history that shows why
        we should not try to improve upon the biological design with which we are endowed.
        Augmenting breasts or prolonging erections may be vain and even a waste of scarce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, but seeking to use our knowledge to enhance our vision, memory, learning skills,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">immunity</ENAMEX>, or metabolism is not obviously either.
        Ultimately, anti-meliorism posits a static vision of human nature to which the
        anti-meliorists mandate we reconcile ourselves. If anything is clear about human nature, it
        is that this is not an accurate view of who we have been or what we are now, or a view that
        should determine what we become.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Elliott</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Viewpoint: Pharma's Gain May Be Our Loss</ENAMEX>
        Those of us who worry about medical enhancement are usually less worried about the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> themselves than about the larger social effects of embracing them too
        enthusiastically. Just as you do not need to object to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> to worry about urban sprawl,
        you do not need to object to enhancement technologies to question where these technologies
        may be taking us. It is not just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technophobes</ENAMEX> who wonder whether a society that consumes
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the world's supply of methylphenidate (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ritalin</ENAMEX>), where the most profitable class of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is antidepressants, and where cosmetic surgeons perform liposuction on prime-time
        television is a society that has somehow lost its way.
        Let's look at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the most commercially successful medical enhancements of recent
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>: selective serotonin reuptake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement therapy, and the diet
        drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fenfluramine-phentermine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fen-Phen</ENAMEX>). What can we learn from these interventions?
        First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of enhancement technologies will usually exploit the blurry
        line between enhancement and treatment in order to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. Because enhancement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> must be prescribed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> typically market the
        technologies not as enhancements, but as treatments for newly discovered or
        under-recognized disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> were marketed not as
        personality enhancers, or even only as treatments for clinical depression, but as
        treatments for questionable illnesses like ‚Äúpremenstrual dysphoric disorder‚Äù [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Fen-Phen
        was sold not as a mere diet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> but as a treatment for obesity, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyeth</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>, portrayed as a dangerous public health problem [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Estrogen</ENAMEX> replacement
        therapy was initially marketed as a risk-free way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to extend their youthfulness.
        But when a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> study found that estrogen replacement therapy was associated with an
        increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">endometrial cancer</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> added <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX>, renamed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">combination ‚Äúhormone‚Äù</ENAMEX> replacement therapy, and recast it as a treatment for medical
        problems associated with menopause such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">osteoporosis</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, an alarming number of supposedly risk-free enhancements have later been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with unanticipated side effects, some of them deadly. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyeth</ENAMEX> has set aside over
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16 billion</NUMEX> to compensate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have developed valvular heart
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary hypertension</ENAMEX> after taking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fen-Phen</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> study found that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement therapy was associated with such an elevated
        risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, pulmonary emboli, and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> that the study was
        stopped prematurely [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Selective serotonin reuptake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are currently embroiled
        in controversy over whether they are associated with an elevated risk of suicide [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the most successful enhancement technologies have been backed by tremendously
        influential public relations campaigns. These campaigns have included ghostwritten journal
        articles, industry-funded front <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and lucrative payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX>, professional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">societies</ENAMEX>, and university centers [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GlaxoSmithKline</ENAMEX> marketed paroxetine
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paxil</ENAMEX>) by promoting the previously obscure diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúsocial anxiety disorder‚Äù</ENAMEX> through
        phony support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrity spokespeople</ENAMEX>, a direct-to-consumer illness awareness
        campaign, and generous payments to key opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of estrogen
        replacement therapy marketed the hormone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> by funding a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúresearch foundation‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wilson</ENAMEX>, the gynecologist and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of the best-selling book 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Feminine Forever</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Wyeth marketed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fen-Phen</ENAMEX> by funding obesity research
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, launching public fitness campaigns, contracting with a medical education company
        to produce a series of ghostwritten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> articles, and making generous payments to
        academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who then published extensively and testified for the drug's safety to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        The traditional worry about enhancement technologies is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the technologies
        are buying individual well-being at the expense of some larger social good. I may improve
        my own athletic ability by taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>, but I set off a steroid arms race that destroys
        my sport. I may get cosmetic surgery for my ‚ÄúAsian eyes‚Äù or use skin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lighteners</ENAMEX> for my dark
        skin, but I reinforce the implicitly racist social norms that say that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> eyes or dark
        skin are traits to be ashamed of. The worry is that some aspect of the way we live
        together, collectively, is going to be damaged by actions that we take individually
        [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        A market-driven health-care system brings this worry much closer to home. The
        pharmaceutical industry is now the most profitable and politically powerful industry in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. It also has a huge financial interest in creating a demand for
        enhancement technologies. The pharmaceutical industry can buy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> to pass
        industry-friendly legislation; it can buy academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> to publish favorable journals
        articles; it can buy professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> and patient support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to spread the word
        on the newly medicalized disorders that its interventions are developed to treat [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]. It
        can even buy bioethicists to dispense with any moral concerns [<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. In this kind of
        political and economic climate, how likely is it that dissenting voices will have any
        effect before it is too late?
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caplan's Response</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Viewpoint</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX> professes to be unhappy about enhancement. What arguments does he present to
        support his unhappiness? Not many, and the arguments that he does offer miss the point
        completely.
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to feel better, sleep less, have fewer hot flashes, better vision, or
        fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrinkles</ENAMEX>, then they may want to use enhancement technologies to achieve these things.
        Technology in itself isn't driving us in any particular direction‚ÄîI believe that we decide
        where it should go. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX>, however, gravely warns us that you and I do not really decide
        a direction when it comes to matters of enhancement. It is‚Äîlisten carefully for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darth</ENAMEX>
        Vader‚Äìesque hissing‚Äîdrug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>!
        The rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX>'s viewpoint amounts to what is his increasingly familiar harangue
        against the pharmaceutical industry. The drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> sucker us into buying enhancement
        by getting us hooked on pseudotherapies. The drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> rob us of our will to fend off
        their siren-like messages of better living through their chemistry. And the drug companies
        get us feeling so bad about ourselves that we empty our wallets on their latest overpriced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geegaws</ENAMEX>.
        Pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> may be evil incarnate. And we may be putty in their pecuniary
        little hands. But that has nothing at all to do with the question of whether there is
        anything wrong with pursuing enhancement. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott eagerly</ENAMEX> dons his hair shirt to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bemoan Big Pharma</ENAMEX>, he finds so much sin to revel in that he forgets to give a reason, any
        reason, why enhancement is, in itself, immoral.
        At most he presents an argument for keeping the pharmaceutical industry out of
        enhancement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Okay</ENAMEX>, so let's take Big Pharma out of the picture. If we left the
        encouragement of enhancement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, would this now be morally acceptable? I think sometimes it would be.
        And nothing that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX> says provides any reason to think otherwise.
      
      
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Response to Caplan's Viewpoint</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caplan</ENAMEX> does not defend medical enhancement so much as attack its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>. Or rather, he
        attacks a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> who want to preserve ‚Äúhuman nature.‚Äù He
        dispatches those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> with admirable precision, but I am not sure why he believes that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> includes me. My worry about enhancement technologies has little to do with
        human nature. My worry is that we will ignore important human needs at the expense of
        frivolous human desires; that dominant social norms will crowd out those of the minority;
        that the self-improvement agenda will be set not by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, but by powerful corporate
        interests; and that in the pursuit of betterment, we will actually make ourselves worse
        off.
        It's no secret that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are deeply ashamed of their personal shortcomings and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inadequacies</ENAMEX>. Nor is it any secret that these shortcomings and inadequacies can be
        exploited for commercial profit. But do we really want to submit our health-care system to
        the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that have made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaires</ENAMEX> out of motivational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> and diet book
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>?
        Skepticism about enhancement technologies is not equivalent to a wish to set back
        medical research and declare some applications off-limits. This is a debate about enhancing
        human traits, not curing human illness. To say that our medical research agenda will be set
        back if we restrict enhancement technologies makes no more sense than saying that cancer
        surgery will be set back if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Broadcasting Corporation</ENAMEX> cancels its cosmetic
        surgery reality TV show 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Extreme Makeover</ENAMEX> .
        We live in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 million</NUMEX> uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> cannot get basic medical care,
        while the rest of us spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a billion dollars</NUMEX> a year on baldness remedies. It is not just
        the inequity here that is so impressive. It is the fact that we have gotten so accustomed
        to the inequity that we do not see it as obscene.
