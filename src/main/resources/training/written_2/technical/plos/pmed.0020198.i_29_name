        according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX>. Smoking-related diseases kill one in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">globally</ENAMEX>, i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 million</NUMEX> deaths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>; by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX>, if current trends continue, smoking
        will kill one in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Smoking is a prime factor in heart disease, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, and
        chronic lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, which cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The
        relationship between smoking and cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is well documented, as is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of smoking with increased levels of inflammatory markers and accelerated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX>. It is also well known that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> quit, their risk of mortality and
        future cardiac events declines, but there is little data quantifying the rate of this risk
        reduction.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Smoking</ENAMEX> triggers an immunologic response to vascular injury, which is associated with
        increased levels of inflammatory markers, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> and white blood cell
        count. Several studies have shown that such markers predict future cardiovascular events.
        Markers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX> are also increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX>. There are, however, still some gaps in our knowledge of cardiovascular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, smoking, and the predictive use of such markers. For example, few studies have
        examined the impact of smoking cessation on levels of inflammatory markers or on
        cardiovascular risk reduction; the level and rate at which the inflammatory response
        subsides following smoking cessation is also uncertain. Furthermore, whether traditional
        risk factors can explain the decline in cardiovascular risk following smoking cessation is
        also unclear.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arvind Bakhru</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Erlinger</ENAMEX> investigate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between smoking and smoking cessation and levels of inflammatory markers and
        cardiovascular risk factors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were gathered on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,489</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1988 and 1994</TIMEX>
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</ENAMEX>. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,665</NUMEX> were
        classified as never <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,459</NUMEX> were former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,365</NUMEX> were current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> focused on changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>, white blood cell count,
        albumin, and fibrinogen, and the traditional risk factors—total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, high-density
        lipoprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes—that occurred
        with decreased smoking intensity and increased time since smoking cessation. They found
        that inflammatory markers had a dose-dependent and temporal relationship to smoking and
        smoking cessation. They noted that both inflammatory and traditional risk factors improved
        with less smoking, but as the time since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> quit increased, inflammatory markers
        resolved more slowly than traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Still, the
        smoking-associated inflammatory response returned to normal within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> after smokers
        quit, suggesting that the vascular effects were reversible and that cardiovascular risk
        subsides gradually with reduced exposure.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> conclude that these findings support the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">falls</ENAMEX> as inflammatory response falls, and that inflammatory markers are good indicators of
        this risk reduction. Despite limitations of the study, including possible errors from
        self-reporting and lack of data on second-hand smoke and newer measures such as
        interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive protein</ENAMEX>, the inflammatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> studied
        here demonstrated a much clearer trend and longer-lasting effect after smoking cessation
        than traditional risk factors, and hence were more useful and accurate markers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        As with related studies, these results suggest that smoking cessation should be a more
        prominent goal of public policy, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> conclude that policymakers must pursue
        smoking cessation plans as an opportunity to make savings on health care through
        cardiovascular risk reduction. Further research should explore the acute phase response in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> after smoking cessation, which this and other studies have not been able to
        study adequately.
