        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a million</NUMEX> deaths. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Ninety percent</NUMEX> of deaths due to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, south
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sahara</ENAMEX>, mostly in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The number of deaths is increasing, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key
        factor linked to this has been widespread drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> of 
        Plasmodium falciparum to conventional antimalarials, such as
        sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>); such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> is widespread in southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. The inappropriate use of antimalarials during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</TIMEX> has
        contributed to this increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. For example, there has been overreliance on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quinolines</ENAMEX> (such as chloroquine) and antifolates (such as pyrimethamine) resulting in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-resistance among these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> classes. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        antimalarials—the artemisinin compounds, such as artesunate, artemether, and
        dihydroartemisinin—have been deployed on an increasingly large scale.
        These compounds produce a very rapid therapeutic response, are active against parasites
        resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, are well tolerated, and reduce gametocyte <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>. To date,
        no parasite resistance to these compounds has been detected.
        If used alone, the artemisinins will cure <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">falciparum malaria</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX>, but studies
        in southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> have shown that combinations of artemisinin compounds with certain
        synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs produce</ENAMEX> high cure rates after just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> of treatment. There is also
        some evidence that combinations of therapies could greatly retard development of resistance
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> drug. Although combinations including artemisinins have been widely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">advocated</ENAMEX>, they are expensive and relatively untested in highly endemic areas.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>'s 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLoS Medicine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adoke Yeka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> compared artemisinin-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> and other combination therapies in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> with varying transmission
        intensity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,160</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> or greater with uncomplicated
        falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> tested the combination of chloroquine and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>, currently the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line therapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>, the combination of amodiaquine and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>, a cheap regimen proven
        to be efficacious in previous trials, and the combination of amodiaquine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">artesunate</ENAMEX>.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 28-day</TIMEX> study they collected data on the efficacy of the different regimens
        and examined the effect on recrudescence and new infections after therapy. Combined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amodiaquine</ENAMEX> and artesunate was the most efficacious regimen for preventing recrudescence,
        but this benefit was outweighed by an increased risk of new infection. This result was
        probably due to artesunate being rapidly eliminated, leaving only amodiaquine to provide
        post-treatment prophylaxis. Considering all recurrent infections, the combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amodiaquine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX> was at least as efficacious as the other combinations at all sites and
        superior at the highest transmission sites.
        In all, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> of all recurrent infections were due to new infections, and with the two
        most efficacious regimens (amodiaquine and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SP</ENAMEX>, and amodiaquine and artesunate) this
        proportion was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>. The identification of new infections stressed the need for other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malaria</ENAMEX> control measures, such as bed nets, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.
        They also suggested that antimalarials should be judged not just on their impact on
        recrudescence but also on their impact on the risk of new infections after therapy.
        Previous studies have suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who suffer recrudescence have a higher risk
        of complicated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and death. Artemisinins are highly attractive antimalarials, but
        when used as monotherapy, they have a high risk of recrudescence and hence must be combined
        with other antimalarials to achieve maximum efficacy. But whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> drug should
        be long or short acting remains unclear, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>.
        Altogether, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">artemisinin</ENAMEX> combinations offer great hope for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> say,
        although the ideal combination regimen remains uncertain and cost is a problem. To compare
        the efficacy of the different therapies, bigger and longer controlled trials are needed in
        conditions of varied transmission intensity. Nevertheless, based on the results of this
        study and others, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> has chosen a combination of artemether and lumefantrine as its
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-line therapy against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>.
