(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
In order to determine the number of proposals eligible
for allocations from the reserve undersubsection (a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) and the
number of allowances remaining available after each proposal is
acted upon, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> shall reduce the total number of
allowances remaining available in the reserve by the number of
allowances calculated according to subparagraphs (A), (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) and (C)
until either no allowances remain available in the reserve for
further allocation or all approved proposals have been acted upon.
If no allowances remain available in the reserve for further
allocation before all proposals have been acted upon by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX>, any pending proposals shall be disapproved. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> shall calculate allowances equal to-

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subsection</ENAMEX> shall providethat for each ton of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
emissions avoided by an electric utility, during the applicable
period, through the use of qualified energy conservation measures
or qualified renewable energy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> shall allocate a
single allowance to such electric utility, on a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-come-<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-served basis from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation</ENAMEX> and
Renewable

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Reserve</ENAMEX> established under subsection (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>), up to a total
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> allowances for allocation from such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX>.



(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)
Requirements for issuance.- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> shall
allocate allowances to anelectric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> under this subsection
only if all of the following requirements are met:



(i)
Such electric utility is paying for the qualified energy
conservation measuresor qualified renewable energy directly or
through purchase from another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>.



(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
The emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> avoided through the use
of qualified energyconservation measures or qualified renewable
energy are quantified in accordance with regulations promulgated by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> under this

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX>) The qualified energy conservation measures or qualified
renewableenergy, or both, are consistent with that plan.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) Electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> subject to the jurisdiction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
regulatoryauthority must have such plan approved by such authority.
For electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> not subject to the jurisdiction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> such plan shall be approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rate-making</ENAMEX> authority for such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>.


(iv)
In the case of qualified energy conservation measures
undertaken by aState regulated electric utility, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of
Energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">certifies</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State</ENAMEX> regulatory authority with
jurisdiction over the electric rates of such electric utility has
established rates and charges which ensure that the net income of
such electric utility after implementation of specific cost
effective energy conservation measures is at least as high as such
net income would have been if the energy conservation measures had
not been implemented. Upon the date of any such certification by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>, all allowances which, but for this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paragraph</ENAMEX>, would have been allocated under subparagraph (A) before
such date, shall be allocated to the electric utility. This clause
is not a requirement for qualified renewable energy.


(v)
Such utility or any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>'s holding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> owns oroperates at least one affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.





(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX>)
Period of applicability.--Allowances under this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subsection</ENAMEX> shall be allocated onlywith respect to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">kilowatt hours</TIMEX> of

(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> shall by regulation establish annual
allowable emission limitations for nitrogen oxides for the types of
utility boilers listed below, which limitations shall not exceed
the rates listed below: Provided, That the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> may set a
rate higher than that listed for any type of utility boiler if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> finds that the maximum listed rate for that boiler
type cannot be achieved using low NOx burner technology. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> shall implement this paragraph <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 40</TIMEX> CFR <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76.5</NUMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). The maximum allowable emission rates are as
follows:



(A)
for tangentially fired boilers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/mmBtu;


(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)

applying cell burner technology),


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0.50 lb/mmBtu.</ENAMEX> After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 1995</TIMEX>, it shall be unlawful for
any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> that is anaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that date</TIMEX> and is of the type
listed in this paragraph to emit nitrogen oxides in excess of the

(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> shall, by regulation, establish
allowable emission limitations on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alb</ENAMEX>/mmBtu, annual average basis,
for nitrogen oxides for the following types of utility
boilers:

(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)
all other types of utility boilers.The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>
shall base such rates on the degree of reduction achievable through
the retrofit application of the best system of continuous emission
reduction, taking into account available technology, costs and
energy and environmental impacts; and which is comparable to the
costs of nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oxides</ENAMEX> controls set pursuant to subsection
