1.1
This manual describes chronic toxicity tests for use in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</ENAMEX> (NPDES) Permits
Program to identify effluents and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> containing toxic
materials in chronically toxic concentrations. The methods included
in this manual are referenced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table IA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFR</ENAMEX> Part 136
regulations and, therefore, constitute approved methods for chronic
toxicity tests. They are also suitable for determining the toxicity
of specific compounds contained in discharges. The tests may be
conducted in a central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or on-site, by the regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> or the permittee.


1.2
The data are used for NPDES permits development and to
determine compliance with permit toxicity limits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> can also be
used to predict potential acute and chronic toxicity in the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LC50</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC50</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IC25</NUMEX> (see Section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronic Toxicity Endpoints and Data Analysis</ENAMEX>) and appropriate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dilution</ENAMEX>, application, and persistence factors. The tests are
performed as a part of self-monitoring permit requirements,
compliance biomonitoring inspections, toxics sampling inspections,
and special investigations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from chronic toxicity tests
performed as part of permit requirements are evaluated during
compliance evaluation inspections and performance audit
inspections.


1.3
Modifications of these tests are also used in toxicity
reduction evaluations and toxicity identification evaluations to
identify the toxic components of an effluent, to aid in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and implementation of toxicity reduction plans, and to
compare and control the effectiveness of various treatment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> for a given type of industry, irrespective of the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988c</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989b</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989c</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>).


1.4
This methods manual serves as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> to the acute
toxicity test methods for freshwater and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2002a), the short-term chronic toxicity test methods for marine and
estuarine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002b</TIMEX>), and the manual for evaluation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> performing aquatic toxicity tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991c</TIMEX>).
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> revised previous editions of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> methods
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manuals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994b</TIMEX>).


1.5
Guidance for the implementation of toxicity tests in the
NPDES program is provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Support Document</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Quality</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991a</TIMEX>).


1.6
These freshwater short-term toxicity tests are similar to
those developed for marine and estuarine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to evaluate the
toxicity of effluents discharged to marine and estuarine waters
under the NPDES permit program. Methods are presented in this
manual for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">freshwater organisms</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The methods are all static renewal type
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX> tests except the green alga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selenastrum</ENAMEX> capricornutum,
test which lasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>.


1.7
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> for which test methods are provided are
the fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas; the daphnid, Ceriodaphnia
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dubia</ENAMEX>; and the green alga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selenastrum</ENAMEX> capricornutum.




1.7.1
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the methods incorporate the chronic endpoint of
growth in addition to lethality and one incorporates reproduction.
The fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas, embryo-larval survival and
teratogenicity test incorporates teratogenic effects in addition to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lethality</ENAMEX>. The green alga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selenastrum</ENAMEX> capricornutum, growth test
has the advantage of a relatively short exposure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 2</ENAMEX>
SHORT-TERM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">METHODS FOR ESTIMATING CHRONIC TOXICITY</ENAMEX>
2.1 INTRODUCTION


2.1.1
The objective of aquatic toxicity tests with effluents or
pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> is to estimate the "safe" or "no effect"
concentration of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, which is defined as the
concentration which will permit normal propagation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and
other aquatic life in the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. The endpoints that have
been considered in tests to determine the adverse effects of
toxicants include death and survival, decreased reproduction and
growth, locomotor activity, gill ventilation rate, heart rate,
blood chemistry, histopathology, enzyme activity, olfactory
function, and terata. Since it is not feasible to detect and/or
measure all of these (and other possible) effects of toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> on a routine basis, observations in toxicity tests
generally have been limited to only a few effects, such as
mortality, growth, and reproduction.


2.1.2
Acute lethality is an obvious and easily observed effect
which accounts for its wide use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> period of evaluation
of the toxicity of pure compounds and complex effluents. The
results of these tests were usually expressed as the concentration
lethal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the test organisms (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LC50</NUMEX>) over relatively short
exposure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>).


2.1.3
As exposure periods of acute tests were lengthened, the
LC50 and lethal threshold concentration were observed to decline
for many compounds. By lengthening the tests to include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
complete life cycles and observing the more subtle effects of the
toxicants, such as a reduction in growth and reproduction, more

accurate, direct, estimates of the threshold or safe concentration
of the toxicant could be obtained. However, laboratory life-cycle
tests may not accurately estimate the "safe" concentration of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicants</ENAMEX> because they are conducted with a limited number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> under highly controlled, steady-state conditions, and the
results do not include the effects of the stresses to which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> would ordinarily be exposed in the natural
environment.


2.1.4
An early published account of a full life-cycle, fish
toxicity test was that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephan</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>). In this study,
fathead minnows, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas, were exposed to a graded
series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticide concentrations</ENAMEX> throughout their life cycle, and
the effects of the toxicant on survival, growth, and reproduction
were measured and evaluated. This work was soon followed by full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> tests using other toxicants and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish species</ENAMEX>.


2.1.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKim</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) evaluated the data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> full life-cycle
tests, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> of which used the fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas,
and concluded that the embryo-larval and early juvenile life-stages
were the most sensitive stages. He proposed the use of partial
life-cycle toxicity tests with the early life-stages (ELS) of fish
to establish water quality criteria.


2.1.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sleight</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) found that exposure of critical
life-stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> to toxicants provides estimates of chronically
safe concentrations remarkably similar to those derived from full
life-cycle toxicity tests. They reported that "for a great majority
of toxicants, the concentration which will not be acutely toxic to
the most sensitive life stages is the chronically safe
concentration for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and that the most sensitive life stages are
the embryos and fry". Critical life-stage exposure was considered
to be exposure of the embryos during most, preferably all, of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenic</ENAMEX> (incubation) period, and exposure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fry</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> post-hatch for warm water <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> with embryogenic periods
ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-to-</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen days</TIMEX>, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX> post-hatch for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> with longer embryogenic periods. They concluded that in the
majority of cases, the maximum acceptable toxicant concentration
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATC</ENAMEX>) could be estimated from the results of exposure of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">incubation</TIMEX>, and the larvae for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX>
post-hatch.


2.1.7
Because of the high cost of full life-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> toxicity
tests and the emerging consensus that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ELS</ENAMEX> test data usually
would be adequate for estimating chronically safe concentrations,
there was a rapid shift by aquatic toxicologists to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - 90-day</TIMEX> ELS
toxicity tests for estimating chronically safe concentrations in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX>. In


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> adopted the policy that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ELS</ENAMEX> test data could be used
in establishing water quality criteria if data from full life-cycle
tests were not available (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980a</TIMEX>).


2.1.8
Published reports of the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests indicate
that the relative sensitivity of growth and survival as endpoints
may be species dependent, toxicant dependent, or both. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parrish</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>) examined the literature on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests that used
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> and juveniles of the sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon
variegatus, and found that growth was not a statistically sensitive
indicator of toxicity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> tests. They suggested that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">shortened to 14 days</TIMEX> posthatch and that growth be
eliminated as an indicator of toxic effects.


2.1.9
In a review of the literature on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> full life-cycle
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests performed to determine the chronically safe
concentrations of a wide variety of toxicants, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>, organics, inorganics, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX>, and complex
effluents, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woltering</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>) found that at the lowest effect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, significant reductions were observed in fry survival
in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>, fry growth in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hatchability</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> of the
tests. He also found that fry survival and growth were very often
equally sensitive, and concluded that the growth response could be
deleted from routine application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests. The net result
would be a significant reduction in the duration and cost of
screening tests with no appreciable impact on estimating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATCs</ENAMEX> for
chemical hazard assessments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benoit et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>), however, found
larval growth to be the most significant measure of effect, and
survival to be equally or less sensitive than growth in early
life-stage tests with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.




2.1.10
Efforts to further reduce the length of partial
life-cycle toxicity tests for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> without compromising their
predictive value have resulted in the development of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-day</TIMEX>,
embryo-larval survival and teratogenicity test for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other
aquatic vertebrates (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>), and a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX> larval survival and growth test (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>).


2.1.11
The similarity of estimates of chronically safe
concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxicants</ENAMEX> derived from short-term, embryo-larval
survival and teratogenicity tests to those derived from full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> tests has been demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassidy</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>).


2.1.12
Use of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX>, fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas,
larval survival and growth test was first proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount</ENAMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> annual meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for Environmental</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxicology and Chemistry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). This test was
subsequently used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> in field demonstrations
at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>), and at many other locations. Growth was
frequently found to be more sensitive than survival in determining
the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> effluents.


2.1.13
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>) performed three single toxicant
fathead minnow larval growth tests with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DURSBANÂ®</ENAMEX>,
using dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX>. The results were
comparable to, and had confidence intervals that overlapped with,
chronic values reported in the literature for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> and full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> tests.


2.1.14
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norberg</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>) developed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX> cladoceran
partial life-cycle test and experimented with a number of diets for
use in culturing and testing the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> reticulata
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>). As different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> began to use
this cladoceran test, it was discovered that apparently more than
one species was involved in the tests conducted by the same
laboratory. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berner</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>) studied the problem and determined that
perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as three</NUMEX> variant forms were involved and it was
decided to recommend the use of the more common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia
rather than the originally reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> reticulata. The
method was adopted for use in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> edition of the freshwater
short-term chronic methods (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985e</TIMEX>).


2.1.15
The green alga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selenastrum</ENAMEX> capricornutum, bottle test
was developed, after extensive design, evaluation, and application,
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Eutrophication Research Program</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>). The
test was later modified for use in the assessment of receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waters</ENAMEX> and the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes originating</ENAMEX> from industrial,
municipal, and agricultural point and non-point <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
1978a).


2.1.16
The use of short-term toxicity tests including subchronic
and chronic tests in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES Program</ENAMEX> is especially attractive
because they provide a more direct estimate of the safe
concentrations of effluents in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> than was provided
by acute toxicity tests, at an only slightly increased level of
effort, compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> full life-cycle chronic and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> ELS
tests and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-day</TIMEX> daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daphnia magna</ENAMEX>, life-cycle
test.


2.2
TYPES OF TESTS




2.2.1
The selection of the test type will depend on the NPDES
permit requirements, the objectives of the test, the available
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, the requirements of the test organisms, and effluent
characteristics such as fluctuations in effluent
toxicity.


2.2.2
Effluent chronic toxicity is generally measured using a
multi-concentration, or definitive test, consisting of a control
and a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent concentrations. The tests are
designed to provide dose-response information, expressed as the
percent effluent concentration that affects the hatchability, gross
morphological abnormalities, survival, growth, and/or reproduction
within the prescribed period of time (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four to seven days</TIMEX>). The
results of the tests are expressed in terms of the highest
concentration that has no statistically significant observed effect
on those responses when compared to the controls or the estimated
concentration that causes a specified <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> reduction in
responses versus the controls.


2.2.3
Use of pass/fail tests consisting of a single effluent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (e.g., the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> concentration or RWC) and
a control is not recommended. If the NPDES permit has a whole
effluent toxicity limit for acute toxicity at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, it is
prudent to use that permit limit as the midpoint of a series of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent concentrations. This will ensure that there is
sufficient information on the dose-response relationship. For
example, the effluent concentrations utilized in a test may be: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> effluent, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/2</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/4</ENAMEX>. More specifically, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, appropriate effluent
concentrations may be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX>.


2.2.4
Receiving (ambient) water toxicity tests commonly employ
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatments, a control and the undiluted receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, but
may also consist of a series of receiving water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilutions</ENAMEX>.


2.2.5
A negative result from a chronic toxicity test does not
preclude the presence of toxicity. Also, because of the potential
temporal variability in the toxicity of effluents, a negative test
result with a particular sample does not preclude the possibility
that samples collected at some other time might exhibit chronic
toxicity.


2.2.6
The frequency with which chronic toxicity tests are
conducted under a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES</ENAMEX> permit is determined by the
regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> on the basis of factors such as the variability
and degree of toxicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX>, production schedules, and
process changes.


2.2.7
Tests recommended for use in this methods manual may be
static non-renewal or static renewal. Individual methods specify
which static type of test is to be conducted.


2.3
STATIC TESTS




2.3.1
Static non-renewal tests - The test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed
to the same test solution for the duration of the test.


2.3.2
Static-renewal tests - The test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed to
a fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> of the same concentration of sample every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h or
other prescribed interval, either by transferring the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> to another, or by replacing all or
a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> in the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TOXICITY TEST</ENAMEX>
TYPES


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.4.1 STATIC NON-RENEWAL</ENAMEX>, SHORT-TERM TOXICITY TESTS:
Advantages:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Simple and inexpensive.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Very cost effective in determining compliance with permit
conditions.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited resources</ENAMEX> (space, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manpower</ENAMEX>, equipment) required;
would permit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to perform many more tests in the same amount of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Smaller volume of effluent required than for static
renewal or flow-through tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>




<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dissolved oxygen</ENAMEX> (DO) depletion may result from high
chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), or
metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Possible loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adsorption</ENAMEX> to the exposure vessels.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Generally less sensitive than static renewal, because the
toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> may degrade or be adsorbed, thereby reducing the
apparent toxicity. Also, there is less chance of detecting slugs of
toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>, or other temporal variations in waste
properties.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.4.2 STATIC RENEWAL</ENAMEX>, SHORT-TERM TOXICITY TESTS: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Reduced possibility of DO depletion from high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COD</ENAMEX> and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOD</ENAMEX>, or ill effects from metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the
test solutions.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Reduced possibility of loss of toxicants through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">volatilization</ENAMEX> and/or adsorption to the exposure
vessels.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Test organisms that rapidly deplete energy reserves are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> when the test solutions are renewed, and are maintained in a
healthier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Require greater volume of effluent than non-renewal

3.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL LABORATORY AND FIELD OPERATIONS</ENAMEX>




3.3.1
Work with effluents should be performed in compliance
with accepted rules pertaining to the handling of hazardous
materials (see safety manuals listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> and
Safety, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 3.5</NUMEX>). It is recommended that personnel
collecting samples and performing toxicity tests not work
alone.


3.3.2
Because the chemical composition of effluents is usually
only poorly known, they should be considered as potential health
hazards, and exposure to them should be minimized. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fume</ENAMEX> and canopy
hoods over the toxicity test areas must be used whenever
possible.


3.3.3
It is advisable to cleanse exposed parts of the body
immediately after collecting effluent samples.

4.1 INTRODUCTION


4.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> and maintenance of a toxicity test laboratory
quality assurance (QA) program (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991a</TIMEX>) requires an ongoing
commitment by laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Each toxicity test laboratory
should (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) appoint a quality assurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> with the
responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a QA program;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) prepare a quality assurance plan with stated data quality
objectives (DQOs); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) prepare a written description of laboratory
standard operating procedures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOPs</ENAMEX>) for culturing, toxicity
testing, instrument calibration, sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-custody
procedures, laboratory sample tracking system, glassware cleaning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) provide an adequate, qualified technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">culturing</ENAMEX> and testing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, and suitable space and
equipment to assure reliable data.


4.1.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QA</ENAMEX> practices for toxicity testing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> must
address all activities that affect the quality of the final
effluent toxicity test data, such as: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) effluent sampling and
handling; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and condition of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)

record keeping; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) data evaluation.


4.1.3
Quality control practices, on the other hand, consist of
the more focused, routine, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> activities carried out within
the scope of the overall QA program. For more detailed discussion
of quality assurance and general guidance on good laboratory

4.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AND TEST CHAMBERS</ENAMEX>




4.2.1
Separate test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX> and toxicity testing
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> should be provided to avoid possible loss of cultures due to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-contamination.</ENAMEX> Ventilation systems should be designed and
operated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemical

<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX> or testing areas, and from testing and sample
preparation areas into culture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>.


4.2.2
Laboratory and toxicity test
temperature control equipment must be adequate to maintain
recommended test water temperatures. Recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> must be
used in the fabrication of the test equipment which comes in
contact with the effluent (see Section 5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX> and
Supplies; and specific toxicity test method).


4.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




4.3.1
The test organisms used in the procedures described in
this manual are the fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas, the
daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia, and the green alga, Selenastrum
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capricornutum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and invertebrates should appear healthy,
behave normally, feed well, and have low mortality in the cultures,
during holding, and in test controls. Test organisms should be
positively identified to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 6, Test</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organisms</ENAMEX>).


4.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABORATORY WATER USED FOR</ENAMEX> CULTURING AND <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST DILUTION</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WATER</ENAMEX>


4.4.1 The quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used for test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX> and
for dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used in toxicity tests is extremely important.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uses should come from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> used in effluent toxicity tests will depend in part
on the objectives of the study and logistical constraints, as
discussed in detail in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 7, Dilution Water</ENAMEX>. For tests
performed to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES</ENAMEX> objectives, synthetic, moderately hard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX> should be used.
The dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used for internal quality assurance tests
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and reference toxicants should be the water
routinely used with success in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. Types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are
discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX> and Supplies. Water
used for culturing and test dilution should be analyzed for toxic
metals and organics at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> or whenever difficulty is
encountered in meeting minimum acceptability criteria for control
survival and reproduction or growth. The concentration of the
metals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX>, As, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cr, Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zn</ENAMEX>, expressed as total

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.5 EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER</ENAMEX> SAMPLING
AND HANDLING


4.5.1
Sample holding times and temperatures of effluent samples
collected for on-site and off-site testing must conform to
conditions described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 8, Effluent and Receiving Water</ENAMEX>
Sampling, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sample Handling, and Sample Preparation for Toxicity</ENAMEX>
Tests.


4.6
TEST CONDITIONS




4.6.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> temperature should be maintained within the limits
specified for each test. The temperature of test solutions must be
measured by placing the thermometer or probe directly into the test
solutions, or by placing the thermometer in equivalent volumes of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in surrogate vessels positioned at appropriate locations
among the test vessels. Temperature should be recorded continuously
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> test vessel for the duration of each test. Test
solution temperatures should be maintained within the limits
specified for each test. DO concentration and pH should be checked
at the beginning of each test and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> throughout the test
period.


4.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QUALITY OF TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




4.7.1
The health of test organisms is primarily assessed by the
performance (survival, growth, and/or reproduction) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> treatments of individual tests. The health and sensitivity
of test organisms is also assessed by reference toxicant testing.
In addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, reference toxicant testing is used to initially
demonstrate acceptable laboratory performance (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.15</NUMEX>) and
to document ongoing laboratory performance (Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.16</NUMEX>).


4.7.2
Regardless of the source of test organisms (in-house
cultures or purchased from external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>), the testing
laboratory must perform at least one acceptable reference toxicant
test per month for each toxicity test method conducted in that
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.16</NUMEX>). If a test method is conducted only
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>, or less frequently, a reference toxicant test must be
performed concurrently with each effluent toxicity test.


4.7.3
When acute or short-term chronic toxicity tests are
performed with effluents or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> using test organisms
obtained from outside the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, concurrent toxicity
tests of the same type must be performed with a reference toxicant,
unless the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> provides control chart data from
at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five monthly</TIMEX> short-term chronic toxicity tests
using the same reference toxicant and control conditions (see
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 6, Test Organisms</ENAMEX>).


4.7.4
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> should certify the species identification of
the test organisms, and provide the taxonomic reference (citation
and page) or name(s) of the taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>(s)
consulted.


4.7.5
If routine reference toxicant tests fail to meet test
acceptability criteria, then the reference toxicant test must be
immediately repeated.


4.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOOD QUALITY</ENAMEX>




4.8.1
The nutritional quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> used in culturing and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">testing fish</ENAMEX> and invertebrates is an important factor in the
quality of the toxicity test data. This is especially true for the
unsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> content of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp nauplii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Artemia</ENAMEX>.
Problems with the nutritional suitability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> will be
reflected in the survival, growth, and reproduction of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in cultures and toxicity tests. Artemia cysts, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX> must be obtained as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX>, and Supplies.


4.8.2
Problems with the nutritional suitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> will be
reflected in the survival, growth, and reproduction of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in cultures and toxicity tests. If a batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is
suspected to be defective, the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> fed with
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> can be compared with the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> fed
with a food of known quality in side-by-side tests. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is
used for culturing, its suitability should be determined using a
short-term chronic test which will determine the affect of food
quality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in culture, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> replicates with each food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
Where applicable, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> used only in chronic toxicity tests can be
compared with a food of known quality in side-by-side,
multi-concentration chronic tests, using the reference toxicant
regularly employed in the laboratory QA program.


4.8.3
New batches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> used in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">culturing</ENAMEX> and testing should be analyzed for toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organics</ENAMEX> and
metals or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting minimum
acceptability criteria for control survival and reproduction or
growth. If the concentration of total organochlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>

4.9
ACCEPTABILITY OF SHORT-TERM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHRONIC TOXICITY</ENAMEX>
TESTS




4.9.1
For the tests to be acceptable, control survival in
fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas, and the daphnid, Ceriodaphnia
dubia, tests must be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> or greater. At the end of the test, the
average dry weight of surviving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day-old</TIMEX> fathead minnows in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> must equal or exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.25 mg</NUMEX>. In Ceriodaphnia
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dubia</ENAMEX> controls, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> or more of the surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> must have
produced their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> brood in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 Â± 1 days</TIMEX>, and the number of young
per surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> or greater. In algal toxicity
tests, the mean cell density in the controls after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> h must equal
or exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 x 106</ENAMEX> cells/mL and not vary <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20%</NUMEX> among
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. If these criteria are not met, the test must be
repeated.


4.9.2
An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> test may be conditionally acceptable if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, DO, and other specified conditions fall outside
specifications, depending on the degree of the departure and the
objectives of the tests (see test condition summaries). The
acceptability of the test would depend on the experience and
professional judgment of the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and the
reviewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of the regulatory authority. Any deviation from
test specifications must be noted when reporting data from the
test.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4.10 ANALYTICAL METHODS</ENAMEX>


4.10.1
Routine chemical and physical analyses for culture and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and test solutions must include established
quality assurance practices outlined in USEPA methods manuals
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1979a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979b</TIMEX>).


4.10.2
Reagent containers should be dated and catalogued when
received from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>, and the shelf life should not be
exceeded. Also, working solutions should be dated when prepared,
and the recommended shelf life should be observed.


4.11
CALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATION




4.11.1
Instruments used for routine measurements of chemical and
physical parameters such as pH, DO, temperature, and conductivity,
must be calibrated and standardized according to instrument
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s procedures as indicated in the general section on
quality assurance (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Methods 150.1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170.1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120.1</NUMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979b</TIMEX>). Calibration data are recorded in a permanent log
book.


4.11.2
Wet chemical methods used to measure hardness, alkalinity
and total residual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> must be standardized prior to use each
day according to the procedures for those specific USEPA methods
(see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Methods 130.2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310.1</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979b</TIMEX>).


4.12
REPLICATION AND <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST SENSITIVITY</ENAMEX>




4.12.1
The sensitivity of the tests will depend in part on the
number of replicates per concentration, the significance level
selected, and the type of statistical analysis. If the variability
remains constant, the sensitivity of the test will increase as the
number of replicates is increased. The minimum recommended number
of replicates varies with the objectives of the test and the
statistical method used for analysis of the data.


4.13
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VARIABILITY</ENAMEX> IN <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOXICITY TEST RESULTS</ENAMEX>




4.13.1
Factors which can affect test success and precision
include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the experience and skill of the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
test organism age, condition, and sensitivity; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) dilution water
quality; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) temperature control; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) the quality and quantity
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> provided. The results will depend upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> used and
the strain or source of the test organisms, and test conditions,
such as temperature, DO, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and water quality. The repeatability
or precision of toxicity tests is also a function of the number of
test organisms used at each toxicant concentration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jensen</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>)
discussed the relationship between sample size (number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>) and
the standard error of the test, and considered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> per
concentration as optimum for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis.</ENAMEX>


4.14
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST PRECISION</ENAMEX>




4.14.1
The ability of the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to obtain
consistent, precise results must be demonstrated with reference
toxicants before they attempt to measure effluent toxicity. The
single-laboratory precision of each type of test to be used in a
laboratory should be determined by performing at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> tests
with a reference toxicant.


4.14.2
Test precision can be estimated by using the same strain
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> under the same test conditions and employing a known
toxicant, such as a reference toxicant.


4.14.3
Interlaboratory precision data from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> study of
chronic toxicity tests with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> using the reference
toxicants <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potassium chloride</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> sulfate are shown in Table
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> shows interlaboratory precision data from a study of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> chronic toxicity test methods using effluent, receiving

2001b). The effluent sample was a municipal wastewater spiked with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, the receiving waster sample was a river water spiked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>,
and the reference toxicant sample consisted of moderately-hard
synthetic freshwater spiked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>. Additional precision data for
each of the tests described in this manual are presented in the
sections describing the individual test methods.

4.14.4
Additional information on toxicity test precision is
provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Support Document for Water Quality</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> (see pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-4</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-15</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991a</TIMEX>).


4.14.5
In cases where the test data are used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>
or other point estimation techniques (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 9, Chronic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Toxicity Test Endpoints</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>), precision can be
described by the mean, standard deviation, and relative standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> coefficient of variation, or CV) of the
calculated endpoints from the replicated tests. In cases where the
test data are used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>, precision
can be estimated by empirical confidence intervals derived by using
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICPIN Method</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 9, Chronic Toxicity Test</ENAMEX> Endpoints
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>). However, in cases where the results are
reported in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No-Observed-Effect Concentration</ENAMEX> (NOEC)
and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lowest-Observed-Effect Concentration</ENAMEX> (LOEC) (see Section 9,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chronic Toxicity Test Endpoints</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>) precision can
only be described by listing the NOEC-LOEC interval for each test.
It is not possible to express precision in terms of a commonly used
statistic. However, when all tests of the same toxicant yield the
same NOEC-LOEC interval, maximum precision has been attained. The
"true" no effect concentration could fall anywhere within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC Â±</ENAMEX> (NOEC minus LOEC).


4.14.6
It should be noted here that the dilution factor selected
for a test determines the width of the NOEC-LOEC interval and the
inherent maximum precision of the test. As the absolute value of
the dilution factor decreases, the width of the NOEC-LOEC interval
increases, and the inherent maximum precision of the test
decreases. When a dilution factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> is used, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> could be
considered to have a relative variability <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as high as Â± 300%</NUMEX>. With a
dilution factor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> could be considered to have a
relative variability of Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>. As a result of the variability of
different dilution factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> recommends the use of the
dilution factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> or greater. Other factors which can affect
test precision include: test organism age, condition, and
sensitivity; temperature


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>; and feeding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.15 DEMONSTRATING ACCEPTABLE LABORATORY</ENAMEX>
PERFORMANCE


4.15.1
It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s responsibility to demonstrate its
ability to obtain consistent, precise results with reference
toxicants before it performs toxicity tests with effluents for
permit compliance purposes. To meet this requirement, the
intralaboratory precision, expressed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> coefficient of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> (CV<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>), of each type of test to be used in the laboratory
should be determined by performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more tests with
different batches of test organisms, using the same reference
toxicant, at the same concentrations, with the same test conditions
(i.e., the same test duration, type of dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, age of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, feeding, etc.), and the same data analysis methods. A
reference toxicant concentration series (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX> or higher) should be
selected that will consistently provide partial mortalities at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
or more concentrations.


4.16
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOCUMENTING ONGOING LABORATORY PERFORMANCE</ENAMEX>




4.16.1
Satisfactory laboratory performance is demonstrated by
performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> acceptable test per month with a reference
toxicant for each toxicity test method conducted in the laboratory
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> test method, successive tests must
be performed with the same reference toxicant, at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, in the same dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, using the same data
analysis methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precision</ENAMEX> may vary with the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
reference toxicant, and type of test. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s reference
toxicity data will reflect conditions unique to that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>,
including dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, culturing, and other variables; however,
each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s reference toxicity results should reflect good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repeatability</ENAMEX>.


4.16.2
A control chart should be prepared for each combination
of reference toxicant, test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, test conditions, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>. Toxicity endpoints from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX> tests are adequate
for establishing the control charts. Successive toxicity endpoints
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC25s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s</TIMEX>, etc.) should be plotted and examined to
determine if the results (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">X1</NUMEX>) are within prescribed limits (Figure
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The chart should plot logarithm of concentration on the
vertical axis against the date of the test or test number on the
horizontal axis. The types of control charts illustrated (see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979a</TIMEX>) are used to evaluate the cumulative trend of results
from a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, thus reference toxicant test results
should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of
individual effluent or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> tests. For endpoints that
are


Â¯
point estimates (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s and IC25s</TIMEX>), the cumulative mean (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>) and
upper and lower control limits (Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2S</ENAMEX>) are recalculated with each
successive test result. Endpoints from hypothesis tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAEC</ENAMEX>) from each test are plotted directly on the control chart.
The control limits would consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> concentration interval
above and below the concentration representing the central
tendency. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of data collection, or a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> points, the control chart should be maintained using only the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most recent data points.


4.16.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX> should compare the calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> (i.e.,
standard deviation / mean) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most recent data
points to the distribution of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported nationally
for reference toxicant testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculated CV</ENAMEX> exceeds the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">75th</NUMEX> percentile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported
nationally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> should use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 75th and 90th</TIMEX> percentiles
to calculate warning and control limits, respectively, and the
laboratory should investigate options for reducing variability.
Note: Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> can only be a fixed number of discrete values,
the mean, standard deviation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> cannot be interpreted and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> in the same way that these descriptive statistics are
interpreted and applied for continuous variables such as the IC25
or LC50.


4.16.4
The outliers, which are values falling outside the upper
and lower control limits, and trends of increasing or decreasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, are readily identified. In the case of endpoints that
are point estimates (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s and IC25s</TIMEX>), at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0.05</ENAMEX> probability
level, one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> tests would be expected to fall outside of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits by chance alone. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
reference toxicant tests fall outside the control limits, the
laboratory should investigate sources of variability, take
corrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability, and
perform an additional reference toxicant test during the same
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> limits for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> will also be exceeded
occasionally, regardless of how well a laboratory performs. In
those instances when the laboratory can document the cause for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outlier</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> error, culture health or test system
failure), the outlier should be excluded from the future
calculations of the control limits. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> consecutive
tests do not fall within the control limits, the results


must be explained and the reference toxicant test must be
immediately repeated. Actions taken to correct the problem must be
reported.


4.16.5
If the toxicity value from a given test with a reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxicant</ENAMEX> falls well outside the expected range for the other test
organisms when using the standard dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and other test
conditions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> should investigate sources of
variability, take corrective actions to reduce identified sources
of variability, and perform an additional reference toxicant test
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same month</TIMEX>. Performance should improve with experience,
and the control limits for endpoints that are point estimates
should gradually narrow. However, control limits of Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2S</ENAMEX> will be
exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the time by chance alone, regardless of how well a
laboratory performs. Highly proficient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> which develop
very narrow control limits may be unfairly penalized if a test
result which falls just outside the control limits is rejected de
facto. For this reason, the width of the control limits should be
considered in determining whether or not a reference toxicant test
result falls "well" outside the expected range. The width of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits may be evaluated by comparing the calculated CV
(i.e., standard deviation / mean) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most
recent data points to the distribution of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported
nationally for reference toxicant testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2000b). In determining whether or not a reference toxicant test
result falls "well" outside the expected range, the result also may
be compared with upper and lower bounds for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Â±3S</TIMEX>, as any result
outside these control limits would be expected to occur by chance
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment Canada</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>). When a result
from a reference toxicant test is outside the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, the laboratory must conduct an immediate investigation
to assess the possible causes for the outlier.


4.16.6
Reference toxicant test results should not be used as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX> facto criterion for rejection of individual effluent or
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> tests. Reference toxicant testing is used for
evaluating the health and sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> over time and
for documenting initial and ongoing laboratory performance. While
reference toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto
criterion for test rejection, effluent and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> test
results should be reviewed and interpreted in the light of
reference toxicant test results. The reviewer should consider the
degree to which the reference toxicant test result fell outside of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> chart limits, the width of the limits, the direction of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (toward increased test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism sensitivity</ENAMEX> or toward
decreased test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism sensitivity</ENAMEX>), the test conditions of both
the effluent test and the reference toxicant test, and the
objective of the test.


4.17
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REFERENCE TOXICANTS</ENAMEX>




4.17.1
Reference toxicants such as sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>),
potassium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> (KCl), cadmium chloride (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CdCl2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> sulfate
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CuSO4</NUMEX>), sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecyl sulfate</ENAMEX> (SDS), and potassium dichromate
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K2Cr2O7</NUMEX>), are suitable for use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES Program</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> programs requiring aquatic toxicity tests. EMSL-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>
hopes to release USEPA-certified solutions of cadmium and copper
for use as reference toxicants through cooperative research and
development agreements with commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, and will continue
to develop additional reference toxicants for future release.
Standard reference materials can be obtained from commercial supply
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, or can be prepared inhouse using reagent grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.
The regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should be consulted before reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX>(s) are selected and used.


4.18
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECORD KEEPING</ENAMEX>





4.18.1
Proper record keeping is important. A complete file
should be maintained for each individual toxicity test or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
tests on closely related samples. This file should contain a record
of the sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-custody; a copy of the sample log sheet; the
original bench sheets for the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> responses during the
toxicity test(s); chemical analysis data on the sample(s); detailed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> of the test organisms used in the test(s), such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
source, age, date of receipt, and other pertinent information
relating to their history and health; information on the
calibration of equipment and instruments; test conditions employed;
and results of reference toxicant tests. Laboratory data should be
recorded on a real-time basis to prevent the loss of information or
inadvertent introduction of errors into the record. Original data
sheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory personnel
performing the tests.


4.18.2
The regulatory authority should retain records pertaining
to discharge permits. Permittees are required to retain records
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to permit applications and compliance for a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 CFR 122.41</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)].


<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 5</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT</ENAMEX>, AND SUPPLIES
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</ENAMEX>


5.1.1
Effluent toxicity tests may be performed in a fixed or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX> must include equipment for rearing
and/or holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Culturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for test organisms
may be desirable in fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> which perform large numbers
of tests. Temperature control can be achieved using circulating
water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, heat exchangers, or environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> used
for rearing, holding, acclimating, and testing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> may be
ground <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, dechlorinated tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or
reconstituted synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dechlorination</ENAMEX> can be accomplished
by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon filtration</ENAMEX>, or the use of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX>. Use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg</ENAMEX> (anhydrous) sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> will reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">l.0 mg chlorine</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>
After dechlorination, total residual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> should be
non-detectable. Air used for aeration must be free of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vapors</ENAMEX>. Oil-free air pumps should be used where possible.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Particulates</ENAMEX> can be removed from the air using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALSTONÂ® Grade BX</ENAMEX> or
equivalent filters, and oil and other organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vapors</ENAMEX> can be removed
using activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> filters (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALSTONÂ®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-1</ENAMEX> filter, or
equivalent).


5.1.2
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> must be well ventilated and free from
fumes. Laboratory ventilation systems should be checked to ensure
that return air from chemistry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and/or sample holding
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> is not circulated to test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> culture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or toxicity
test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, or that air from toxicity test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> does not
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">contaminate</ENAMEX> culture areas. Sample preparation, culturing, and
toxicity test areas should be separated to avoid cross
contamination of cultures or toxicity test solutions with toxic
fumes. Air pressure differentials between such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> should not
result in a net flow of potentially contaminated air to sensitive
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> through open or loosely- fitting doors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organisms</ENAMEX> should be
shielded from external disturbances.


5.1.3
Materials used for exposure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>, tubing, etc., that
come in contact with the effluent and dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> should be
carefully chosen. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tempered glass</ENAMEX> and perfluorocarbon plastics
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEFLONÂ®</ENAMEX>) should be used whenever possible to minimize sorption and
leaching of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. These materials may be reused
following decontamination. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Containers</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX>, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypropylene</ENAMEX>, polyvinyl chloride, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TYGONÂ®</ENAMEX>, etc., may
be used as test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> or to ship, store and transfer effluents
and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, but they should not be reused unless
absolutely necessary, because they could carry over adsorbed
toxicants from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test to another, if reused. However, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> may be repeatedly reused for storing uncontaminated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waters</ENAMEX>, such as deionized or laboratory-prepared dilution waters
and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. Glass or disposable polystyrene containers
can be used for test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. The use of large (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L</ENAMEX>) glass
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboys</ENAMEX> is discouraged for safety reasons.


5.1.4
New plastic products of a type not previously used should
be tested for toxicity before initial use by exposing the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the test system where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is used. Equipment
(pumps, valves, etc.) which cannot be discarded after each use
because of cost, must be decontaminated according to the cleaning
procedures listed below (see Section 5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX> and
Supplies, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 5.3.2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fiberglass</ENAMEX> and stainless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, in
addition to the previously mentioned materials, can be used for
holding, acclimating, and dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, and in the
water delivery system, but once contaminated with pollutants the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiberglass</ENAMEX> should not be reused. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> should be flushed or
rinsed thoroughly with the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> before using in the
test.


5.1.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX>, galvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>, brass, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead</ENAMEX> must
not come in contact with culturing, holding, acclimation, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>, or with effluent samples and test solutions. Some
materials, such as several types of neoprene rubber (commonly used
for stoppers), may be toxic and should be tested before
use.


5.1.6
Silicone adhesive used to construct glass test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>
absorbs some organochlorine and organophosphorus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>, which
are difficult to remove. Therefore, as little of the adhesive as
possible should be in contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Extra beads of adhesive
inside the containers should be removed.


5.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEST CHAMBERS</ENAMEX>




5.2.1
Test chamber size and shape are
varied according to size of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. Requirements are
specified in each toxicity test method.


5.3

5.3.1
New <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasticware</ENAMEX> used for sample collection or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
exposure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> does not require thorough cleaning before use. It
is sufficient to rinse new sample containers once with dilution
water before use. New <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glassware</ENAMEX> must be soaked overnight in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6.1 TEST SPECIES</ENAMEX>


6.1.1
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> used in characterizing the chronic toxicity
of effluents and/or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> will depend on the
requirements of the regulatory authority and the objectives of the
test. It is essential that good quality test organisms be readily
available throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> from inhouse or commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to
meet NPDES monitoring requirements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> used in the
toxicity tests must be identified to species. If there is any doubt
as to the identity of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, representative specimens
should be sent to a taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> to confirm the
identification.


6.1.2
Toxicity test conditions and culture methods for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Subsection</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.3</NUMEX> are provided in this manual
also, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002a</TIMEX>.


6.1.3
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> used in the short-term chronic toxicity
tests described in this manual are the fathead minnow, Pimephales
promelas, the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berner</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>), and the
green alga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selenastrum</ENAMEX> capricornutum.


6.1.4
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have developed culturing and testing methods
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">indigenous species</ENAMEX> that may be as sensitive, or more sensitive,
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> recommended in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Subsection</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.3</NUMEX>. However, USEPA
allows the use of indigenous species only where state regulations
require their use or prohibit importation of the recommended
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">species in Subsection</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.3</NUMEX>. Where state regulations prohibit
importation of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> fishes or the use of recommended test

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> prior to their use.


6.1.5
Where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have developed culturing and testing methods

fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas, culture method is given in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 11</ENAMEX> and not repeated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 12</ENAMEX>. Also, see USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2002a</NUMEX>).


6.2.2
Inhouse cultures should be established wherever it is
cost effective. If inhouse cultures cannot be maintained or it is
not cost effective, test organisms or starter cultures should be
purchased from experienced commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2002a).


6.2.3
Starter cultures of the green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algae</ENAMEX>, Selenastrum
capricornutum, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> minutum, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydomonas</ENAMEX> reinhardti are
available from commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>.


6.2.4
Because the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia, must be cultured
individually in the laboratory for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least seven days</TIMEX> before the
test begins, it will be necessary to obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">starter</ENAMEX> culture from
a commercial source <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three weeks</TIMEX> before the test is to
begin if they are not being cultured inhouse.


6.2.5
If, because of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, there is any uncertainty
concerning the identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, it is advisable to have
them examined by a taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> to confirm their
identification. For detailed guidance on identification, see the
individual test methods.


6.2.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERAL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NATURAL OCCURRING, WILD CAUGHT</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>


6.2.6.1 The use of test organisms taken from the receiving water
has strong appeal, and would seem to be a logical approach.
However, it is generally impractical and not recommended for the
following reasons:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sensitive organisms</ENAMEX> may not be present in the receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> because of previous exposure to the effluent or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
It is often difficult to collect organisms of the
required age and quality from the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> require collecting permits, which may be
difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is usually more cost effective
to culture the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or obtain them from
private, state, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The fathead minnow, Pimephales
promelas, the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia, and the green alga,
Selenastrum capricornutum, are easily cultured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or
readily available commercially.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
The required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QA/QC</ENAMEX> records, such as the single laboratory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> data, would not be available.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
Since it is mandatory that the identity of the test
organism be known to species level, it would be necessary to
examine each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> caught in the wild to confirm its identity.
This would usually be impractical or, at the least, very stressful
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
Test organisms obtained from the wild must be observed in
the laboratory for a minimum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> prior to use, to assure
that they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial infections
and other adverse effects. Fish captured by electroshocking must
not be used in toxicity testing.




6.2.6.2
Guidelines for collecting natural occurring <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are
provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) and USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1993b</NUMEX>).


6.2.7
Regardless of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, test organisms should be
carefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stress
and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and in good physical condition. Some species of test
organisms can be obtained from commercial stock certified as
"disease-free".


6.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFE STAGE</ENAMEX>


6.3.1 Young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are often more sensitive to toxicants than
are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. For this reason, the use of early life stages, such as
larval <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, is required for all tests. In a given test, all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> should be approximately the same age and should be taken
from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> may affect the results of the
tests, it would enhance the value and comparability of the data if
the same species in the same life stages were used throughout a
monitoring program at a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">6.4 LABORATORY CULTURING</ENAMEX>


6.4.1
Instructions for culturing and/or
holding the recommended test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are included in the
respective test methods (also, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002a</TIMEX>).


6.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HOLDING AND HANDLING TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




6.5.1
Test organisms should not be subjected to changes of more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3Â°C</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> temperature in any <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 h</TIMEX> period or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> units of pH
in any <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-h</TIMEX> period.


6.5.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organisms</ENAMEX> should be handled as little as possible. When
handling is necessary, it should be done as gently, carefully, and
quickly as possible to minimize stress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> that are dropped
or touch a dry surface or are injured during handling must be
discarded. Dipnets are best for handling larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nets</ENAMEX> are commercially available or can be made from small-mesh
nylon netting, silk batting cloth, plankton netting, or similar
material. Wide-bore, smooth glass tubes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 8</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>) with rubber
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> or pipettors (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROPIPETTEÂ®</ENAMEX>) should be used for
transferring smaller organisms such as larval <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.


6.5.3
Holding tanks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are supplied with good quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (see Section 5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplies</ENAMEX>) with
flow-through rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> tank volumes per day. Otherwise
use a recirculation system where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> flows through an activated
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> or undergravel filter to remove dissolved metabolites.
Culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can also be piped through high intensity ultraviolet
light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for disinfection, and to photodegrade dissolved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organics</ENAMEX>.


6.5.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crowding</ENAMEX> must be avoided because it will stress the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and lower the DO concentrations to unacceptable levels.
The solution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> depends on temperature and altitude. The DO
must be maintained at a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Aerate</ENAMEX> gently if
necessary.


6.5.5
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> should be observed carefully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> for
signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, physical damage, or mortality. Dead and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">abnormal organisms</ENAMEX> should be removed as soon as observed. It is not
uncommon for some fish mortality (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) to occur during the first
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX> in a holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that refuse to feed
on artificial food and die of starvation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> in the holding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> should generally be fed as in the cultures (see culturing
methods in the respective methods).


6.5.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> should be fed as much as they will eat at least once
a day with live <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp nauplii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Artemia</ENAMEX>, or frozen adult
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp</ENAMEX>, or dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> (frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> should be completely thawed
before use). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Adult brine shrimp</ENAMEX> can be supplemented with
commercially prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TETRAMINÂ®</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BIORILÂ® flake food</ENAMEX>,
or equivalent. Excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and fecal material should be removed
from the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> at least twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siphoning</ENAMEX>.


6.5.7
A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> record of feeding, behavioral observations, and
mortality should be maintained.


6.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANSPORTATION</ENAMEX> TO THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST SITE</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> are transported from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> or supply
laboratory to a remote test site in culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> in plastic bags or large-mouth screw-cap (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 mL</NUMEX>)
plastic bottles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam coolers</ENAMEX>. Adequate DO is maintained by
replacing the air above the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the bags with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> from a
compressed gas cylinder, and sealing the bags or by use of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">airstone</ENAMEX> supplied by a portable pump. The DO concentration must not
fall below
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4.0 mg/L.</ENAMEX>
6.6.2 Upon arrival at the test site, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are
transferred to receiving water if receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is to be used as
the test dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. All but a small volume of the holding
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX>) is removed by siphoning and replaced
slowly over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 to 15 minute</TIMEX> period with dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is to be used as the dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, caution must
be exercised in exposing the test organisms to it, because of the
possibility that it might be toxic. For this reason, it is
recommended that only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of the test organisms be
exposed initially to the dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> does not
show excessive mortality or obvious signs of stress in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>,
the remainder of the test organisms may be transferred to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>.


6.6.3
A group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> must not be
used for a test if they appear to be unhealthy, discolored, or
otherwise stressed, or if mortality appears to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> preceding
the test. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> fail to meet these criteria, the entire
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> must be discarded and a new group obtained. The mortality may
be due to the presence of toxicity, if the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is used
as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, rather than a diseased condition of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. If the acclimation process is repeated with a new group
of test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and excessive mortality occurs, it is recommended
that an alternative source of dilution water be used.


6.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ORGANISM DISPOSAL</ENAMEX>


6.7.1 When the toxicity test(s) is concluded, all test organisms
(including controls) should be humanely destroyed and disposed of
in an appropriate manner.
