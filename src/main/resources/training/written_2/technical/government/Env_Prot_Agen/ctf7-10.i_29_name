<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.1 TYPES OF DILUTION WATER</ENAMEX>

7.1.1 The type of dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used in effluent toxicity
tests will depend largely on the objectives of the study.


7.1.1.1
If the objective of the test is to estimate the absolute
chronic toxicity of the effluent, a synthetic (standard) dilution
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is used. If the test organisms have been cultured in water
which is different from the test dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of
controls, using culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, should be included in the
test.


7.1.1.2
If the objective of the test is to estimate the chronic
toxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the
test may be conducted using dilution water consisting of a single
grab sample of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (if non-toxic), collected either
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">upstream</ENAMEX> and outside the influence of the outfall, or with other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uncontaminated</ENAMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (ground or surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) or standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> having approximately the same characteristics
(hardness, alkalinity, and conductivity) as the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seasonal</TIMEX> variations in the quality of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> may affect
effluent toxicity. Therefore, the pH, alkalinity, hardness, and
conductivity of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water samples</ENAMEX> should be determined before
each use. If the test organisms have been cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> which
is different from the test dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of
controls, using culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, should be included in the
test.


7.1.1.3
If the objective of the test is to determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
or mitigating effects of the discharge on already contaminated
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the test is performed using dilution water
consisting of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> collected immediately upstream or
outside the influence of the outfall. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of controls,
using culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, should be included in the test.


7.1.2
An acceptable dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is one which is appropriate
for the objectives of the test; supports adequate performance of
the test organisms with respect to survival, growth, reproduction,
or other responses that may be measured in the test (i.e.,
consistently meets test acceptability criteria for control
responses); is consistent in quality; and does not contain
contaminants that could produce toxicity. Receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>,
synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, or synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> adjusted to approximate
receiving water characteristics may be used for dilution provided
that the water meets the above listed qualifications for an
acceptable dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides additional
guidance on selecting appropriate dilution waters.


7.1.3
When dual controls (one control using culture water and
one control using dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) are used (see Subsections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1.1.1</NUMEX>
- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1.1.3</NUMEX> above), the dilution water control should be used to
determine test acceptability. It is also the dilution water control
that should be compared to effluent treatments in the calculation
and reporting of test results. The culture water control should be
used to evaluate the appropriateness of the dilution water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
Significant differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> responses in culture water
and dilution water controls could indicate toxicity in the dilution
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and may suggest an alternative dilution water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides additional guidance on dual controls.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.3 USE OF RECEIVING WATER AS DILUTION WATER</ENAMEX>


7.3.1
If the objectives of the test require the use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncontaminated</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and the receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is uncontaminated, it may be possible to collect a sample of
the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> upstream of, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to</NUMEX>, but outside of the
zone influenced by the effluent. However, if the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contaminated</ENAMEX>, it may be necessary to collect the sample in an area
"remote" from the discharge site, matching as closely as possible
the physical and chemical characteristics of the receiving water
near the outfall.


7.3.2
The sample should be collected immediately prior to the
test, but never more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 h</TIMEX> before the test begins. Except where
it is used within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX>, or in the case where large volumes are
required for flow through tests, the sample should be chilled to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-6Â°C</ENAMEX> during or immediately following collection, and maintained at
that temperature prior to use in the test.


7.3.3
Receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> containing debris or indigenous organisms
that may be confused with or attack the test organisms should be
filtered through a sieve having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> mm mesh openings prior to
use.


7.3.4
Where toxicity-free dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is required in a test,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is considered acceptable if test organisms show the
required survival, growth, and reproduction in the controls during
the test.


7.3.5
The regulatory authority may require that the hardness of
the dilution water be comparable to the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at the
discharge site. This requirement can be satisfied by collecting an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncontaminated</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with a suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hardness</ENAMEX>, or
adjusting the hardness of an otherwise suitable receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> by
addition of reagents as indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.


7.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USE OF TAP WATER AS DILUTION WATER</ENAMEX>




7.4.1
The use of tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is discouraged
unless it is dechlorinated and passed through a deionizer and
carbon filter. Tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can be dechlorinated by deionization,
carbon filtration, or the use of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX>. Use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg/L</ENAMEX> (anhydrous) sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> will reduce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX>/L
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). Following dechlorination, total residual chlorine
should not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX> mg/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> Because of the possible toxicity of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> to test organisms, a control lacking thiosulfate should
be included in toxicity tests utilizing thiosulfatedechlorinated
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


7.4.2
To be adequate for general
laboratory use following dechlorination, the tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is passed
through a deionizer and carbon filter to remove toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> and
organics, and to control hardness and alkalinity.


7.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DILUTION WATER HOLDING</ENAMEX>


7.5.1 A given batch of dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> should not be used for
more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 days</TIMEX> following preparation because of the possible
build-up of bacterial, fungal, or algal slime growth and the
problems associated with it. The container should be kept covered
and the contents should be protected from light.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.1 EFFLUENT</ENAMEX> SAMPLING


8.1.1
The effluent sampling point should be the same as that
specified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES</ENAMEX> discharge permit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988a</TIMEX>). Conditions
for exception would be: (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l</ENAMEX>) better access to a sampling point
between the final treatment and the discharge outfall; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) if the
processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX> is chlorinated prior to discharge, it may also be
desirable to take samples prior to contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> to
determine toxicity of the unchlorinated effluent; or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) in the
event there is a desire to evaluate the toxicity of the influent to
municipal waste treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> or separate wastewater streams in
industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> prior to their being combined with other
wastewater streams or non-contact cooling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, additional
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sampling</NUMEX> points may be chosen.


8.1.2
The decision on whether to collect grab or composite
samples is based on the objectives of the test and an understanding
of the short and long-term operations and schedules of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discharger</ENAMEX>. If the effluent quality varies considerably with time,
which can occur where holding times are short, grab samples may
seem preferable because of the ease of collection and the potential
of observing peaks (spikes) in toxicity. However, the sampling
duration of a grab sample is so short that full characterization of
an effluent over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24-h</TIMEX> period would require a prohibitively large
number of separate samples and tests. Collection of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
composite sample, however, may dilute toxicity spikes, and average
the quality of the effluent over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sampling period</TIMEX>. Sampling
recommendations are provided below (also see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2002a).


8.1.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeration</ENAMEX> during collection and transfer of effluents
should be minimized to reduce the loss of volatile
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.


8.1.4
Details of date, time, location, duration, and procedures
used for effluent sample and dilution water collection should be
recorded.


8.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFFLUENT SAMPLE TYPES</ENAMEX>


8.2.1 The advantages and disadvantages of effluent grab and
composite samples are listed below:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.2.1.1 GRAB SAMPLES Advantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Easy to collect; require a minimum of equipment and
on-site time.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Provide a measure of instantaneous toxicity. Toxicity
spikes are not masked by dilution. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Samples are collected over a very short period of time and on
a relatively infrequent basis. The chances of detecting a spike in
toxicity would depend on the frequency of sampling and the
probability of missing a spike is high.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.2.1.2 COMPOSITE SAMPLES Advantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
A single effluent sample is collected over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
period.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
The sample is collected over a much longer period of time
than a single grab sample and contains all toxicity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spikes</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampling</ENAMEX> equipment is more sophisticated and expensive,
and must be placed on-site for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 24</NUMEX> h.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Toxicity spikes may not be detected because they are
masked by dilution with less toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.3 EFFLUENT SAMPLING RECOMMENDATIONS</ENAMEX>


8.3.1
When tests are conducted on-site, test solutions can be
renewed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> with freshly collected samples, except for the green
alga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selenastrum</ENAMEX> capricornutum, test which is not
renewed.


8.3.2
When tests are conducted off-site, a minimum of three
samples are collected. If these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are collected on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Test Days</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the first sample would be used for test initiation,
and for test solution renewal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 2</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sample would be
used for test solution renewal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 3 and 4</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> sample
would be used for test solution renewal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 5, 6</TIMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.


8.3.3
Sufficient sample volume must be collected to perform the
required toxicity and chemical tests. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-L</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1gal</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUBITAINERÂ®</ENAMEX> will
provide sufficient sample volume for most tests.


8.3.4
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FOLLOWING EFFLUENT SAMPLING METHODS</ENAMEX> ARE
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECOMMENDED</ENAMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.3.4.1 Continuous Discharges</ENAMEX>


8.3.4.1.1
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> discharge is continuous, a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
composite sample is to be taken.


8.3.4.2
Intermittent discharges




8.3.4.2.1
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> discharge is intermittent, a composite
sample is to be collected for the duration of the discharge but not
more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>.


8.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECEIVING WATER SAMPLING</ENAMEX>




8.4.1
Logistical problems and difficulty in securing sampling
equipment generally preclude the collection of composite receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water samples</ENAMEX> for toxicity tests. Therefore, based on the
requirements of the test, a single grab sample or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> grab sample
of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is collected for use in the test.


8.4.2
The sampling point is determined by the objectives of the
test. In rivers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> should be collected from mid-stream and at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-depth, if accessible. In lakes the samples are collected at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-depth.


8.4.3
To determine the extent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of toxicity in the
receiving water downstream from the outfall, receiving water
samples are collected at several distances downstream from the
discharge. The time required for the effluent-receiving-water
mixture to travel to sampling points downstream from the outfall,
and the rate and degree of mixing, may be difficult to ascertain.
Therefore, it may not be possible to correlate downstream toxicity
with effluent toxicity at the discharge point unless a dye study is
performed. The toxicity of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water samples</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
stations downstream from the discharge point can be evaluated using
the same number of test <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and test organisms as used in one
effluent toxicity test with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent dilutions.


8.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLE HANDLING</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRESERVATION, AND SHIPPING</ENAMEX>




8.5.1
Unless the samples are used in an on-site toxicity test
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of collection (or hand delivered to the testing laboratory
for use on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of collection), they should be chilled and
maintained at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-6Â°C until</TIMEX> used to inhibit microbial degradation,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemical</ENAMEX> transformations, and loss of highly volatile toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>.


8.5.2
Composite samples should be chilled as they are
collected. Grab samples should be chilled immediately following
collection.


8.5.3
If the effluent has been chlorinated, total residual
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> must be measured immediately following sample
collection.


8.5.4
Sample holding time begins when the last grab sample in a
series is taken (i.e., when a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> grab samples are taken
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 24-h</TIMEX> period), or when a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24-h</NUMEX> composite sampling period is
completed. If the data from the samples are to be acceptable for
use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES Program</ENAMEX>, the lapsed time (holding time) from
sample collection to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use of each grab or composite sample
must not exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h. EPA</ENAMEX> believes that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> h is adequate time to
deliver the samples to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> performing the test in most
cases. In the isolated cases, where the permittee can document that
this delivery time cannot be met, the permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> can
allow an option for onsite testing or a variance for an extension
of shipped sample holding time. The request for a variance in
sample holding time, directed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA Regional Administrator</ENAMEX>
under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 CFR 136.3</NUMEX>(e) should include supportive data which show
that the toxicity of the effluent sample is not reduced (e.g.,
because of volatilization and/or sorption of toxics on the sample
container surfaces) by extending the holding time beyond more than
36 h. However, in no case should more than 72 h elapse between
collection and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use of the sample. In static-renewal tests,
each grab or composite sample may also be used to prepare test
solutions for renewal at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h, 48 h</TIMEX>, and/or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">72 h after first</TIMEX> use,
if stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-6Â°C</TIMEX>, with minimum head space, as described in
Subsection <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>. If shipping problems (e.g., unsuccessful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saturday</ENAMEX>
delivery) are encountered with renewal samples after a test has
been initiated, the permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> may allow the continued
use of the most recently used sample for test renewal. Guidance for
determining the persistence of the sample is provided in Subsection
8.7.


8.5.5
To minimize the loss of toxicity due to volatilization of
toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>, all sample containers should be "completely"
filled, leaving no air space between the contents and the
lid.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAMPLES SHIPPED TO OFF-SITE FACILITIES</ENAMEX>




8.5.7.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samples</ENAMEX> collected for off-site toxicity testing are to be
chilled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6Â°C</NUMEX> during or immediately after collection, and
shipped iced to the performing laboratory. Sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> should be
placed with the sample in the shipping container to ensure that ice
will still be present when the sample arrives at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and
is unpacked. Insulating material should not be placed between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and the sample in the shipping container unless required to
prevent breakage of glass sample containers.


8.5.7.2
Samples may be shipped in one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-L</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l-gal</TIMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUBITAINERSÂ®</ENAMEX> or new plastic "milk" jugs. All sample containers
should be rinsed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> water before being filled with sample.
After use with receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or effluents, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUBITAINERSÂ®</ENAMEX> and
plastic jugs are punctured to prevent reuse.


8.5.7.3
Several sample shipping options are available, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Express Mail</ENAMEX>, air express, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Express Mail</ENAMEX>

8.6.2
Every effort must be made to initiate the test with an

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PERSISTENCE OF EFFLUENT TOXICITY DURING SAMPLE SHIPMENT</ENAMEX>
AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOLDING</ENAMEX>




8.7.1
The persistence of the toxicity of
an effluent prior to its use in a toxicity test is of interest in
assessing the validity of toxicity test data, and in determining
the possible effects of allowing an extension of the holding time.
Where a variance in holding time (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 36</NUMEX> h, but <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 72</NUMEX> h) is
requested by a permittee, (see <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 8.5.4 above</NUMEX>), information
on the effects of the extension in holding time on the toxicity of
samples must be obtained by comparing the results of
multi-concentration chronic toxicity tests performed on effluent
samples held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> h with toxicity test results using the same samples
after they were held for the requested, longer period. The portion
of the sample set aside for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> test should be held under
the same conditions as during shipment and holding.


8.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PREPARATION OF EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLES FOR</ENAMEX>
TOXICITY TESTS




8.8.1
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliquots</ENAMEX> are removed from the sample container, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> space above the remaining sample should be held to a minimum.
Air which enters a container upon removal of sample should be
expelled by compressing the container before reclosing, if possible
(i.e., where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUBITAINERÂ®</ENAMEX> is used), or by using an appropriate
discharge valve (spigot).


8.8.2
With the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia, and fathead minnow,
Pimephales promelas, tests, effluents and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> should
be filtered through a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-Âµ</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">m plankton</ENAMEX> net to remove indigenous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that may attack or be confused with the test organisms
(see the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia, test method for details).
Receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> used in green alga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selenastrum</ENAMEX> capricornutum,
toxicity tests must be filtered through a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.45-Âµ</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">m pore</ENAMEX> diameter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> before use. It may be necessary to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coarse-filter the
dilution and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste water</ENAMEX> through a nylon sieve having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>- to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-mm</ENAMEX>
mesh openings to remove debris and/or break up large floating or
suspended solids. Because filtration may increase the dissolved
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oxygen</ENAMEX> (DO) in the effluent, the DO should be checked both before
and after filtering. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations will
indicate a potential problem in performing the test. Caution:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filtration</ENAMEX> may remove some toxicity.


8.8.3
If the samples must be warmed to bring them to the
prescribed test temperature, supersaturation of the dissolved
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and nitrogen may become a problem. To avoid this problem,
samples may be warmed slowly in open test containers. If DO is
still <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 100%</NUMEX> saturation after warming to test temperature,
samples should be aerated moderately (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 mL/min</ENAMEX>) for
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> using an airstone. If DO is below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/L after
warming to test temperature, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> must be aerated
moderately (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 mL/min</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>, using an
airstone, until the DO is within the prescribed range (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.0 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX>).
Caution: avoid excessive aeration.


8.8.4
The DO concentration in the samples should be near
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> prior to use. Aeration may be used to bring the DO and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> into equilibrium with air, minimize oxygen demand, and
stabilize the pH. However, aeration during collection, transfer,
and preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> should be minimized to reduce the loss
of volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.




8.8.4.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeration</ENAMEX> during the test may alter the results and should
be used only as a last resort to maintain the required DO. Aeration
can reduce the apparent toxicity of the test solutions by stripping
them of highly volatile toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, or increase their
toxicity by altering pH. However, the DO in the test solutions
should not be allowed to fall below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>


8.8.4.2
In static tests (renewal or non-renewal), low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOs</ENAMEX> may
commonly occur in the higher concentrations of wastewater. Aeration
is accomplished by bubbling air through a pipet at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bubbles/min.</ENAMEX> If aeration is necessary, all test solutions must be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerated</ENAMEX>. It is advisable to monitor the DO closely during the first
few <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of the test. Samples with a potential DO problem
generally show a downward trend in DO within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 to 8 h</TIMEX> after the
test is started. Unless aeration is initiated during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 8 h</TIMEX>
of the test, the DO may be exhausted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an unattended period</TIMEX>,
thereby invalidating the test.


8.8.5
At a minimum, pH, conductivity, and total residual
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> are measured in the undiluted effluent or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
and pH and conductivity are measured in the dilution
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.




8.8.5.1
It is recommended that total alkalinity and total
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hardness</ENAMEX> also be measured in the undiluted effluent test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and the dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


8.8.6
Total ammonia is measured in effluent and receiving water
samples where toxicity may be contributed by unionized ammonia
(i.e., where total ammonia <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX>). The concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>) of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">un-ionized</ENAMEX> (free) ammonia in a sample is a function of temperature
and pH, and is calculated using the percentage value obtained from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, under the appropriate pH and temperature, and multiplying
it by the concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>) of total ammonia in the
sample.


8.8.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Effluents</ENAMEX> and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> can be dechlorinated using
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.7 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> anhydrous sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> to reduce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/L chlorine
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). Note that the amount of thiosulfate required to
dechlorinate effluents is greater than the amount needed to
dechlorinate tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 7, Dilution Water</ENAMEX>, Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.4.1</NUMEX>). Since thiosulfate may contribute to sample toxicity, a
thiosulfate control should be used in the test in addition to the
normal dilution water control.


8.8.8
Mortality or impairment of growth or reproduction due to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pH</ENAMEX> alone may occur if the pH of the sample falls outside the range
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.0</NUMEX>. Thus, the presence of other forms of toxicity (metals
and organics) in the sample may be masked by the toxic effects of
low or high pH. The question about the presence of other toxicants
can be answered only by performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parallel tests, one with an
adjusted pH, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> without an adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pH. Freshwater samples</ENAMEX> are
adjusted to pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> by adding 1N <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaOH</ENAMEX> or 1N <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> dropwise, as
required, being careful to avoid overadjustment.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.9 PRELIMINARY TOXICITY RANGE-FINDING</ENAMEX> TESTS


8.9.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA Regional</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> generally have
observed that it is not necessary to conduct a toxicity
range-finding test prior to initiating a static, chronic,
definitive toxicity test. However, when preparing to perform a
static test with a sample of completely unknown quality, or before
initiating a flow-through test, it is advisable to conduct a
preliminary toxicity range-finding test.


8.9.2
A toxicity range-finding test ordinarily consists of a
down-scaled, abbreviated static acute test in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed to several widely-spaced sample dilutions in
a logarithmic series, such as


<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.0%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.00%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.100%</NUMEX>, and a control, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-24 h.</TIMEX>
Caution: if the sample must also be used for the fullscale
definitive test, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36-h</NUMEX> limit on holding time (see Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.5.4</NUMEX>) must not be exceeded before the definitive test is
initiated.
8.9.3 It should be noted that the toxicity
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LC50</NUMEX>) of a sample observed in a range-finding test may be
significantly different from the toxicity observed in the follow-up
chronic definitive test because: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the definitive test is longer;
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the test may be performed with a sample collected at a
different time, and possibly differing significantly in the level
of toxicity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.10 MULTI-CONCENTRATION</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEFINITIVE</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFFLUENT TOXICITY</ENAMEX>
TESTS


8.10.1
The tests recommended for use in determining discharge
permit compliance in the NPDES program are multi-concentration, or
definitive, tests which provide (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a point estimate of effluent
toxicity in terms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an IC25</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC50</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50</TIMEX>, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a
no-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) defined in terms of
mortality, growth, reproduction, and/or teratogenicity and obtained
by hypothesis testing. The tests may be static renewal or static
non-renewal.


8.10.2
The tests consist of a control and a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
effluent concentrations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">USEPA</ENAMEX> recommends the use of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.5</NUMEX>
dilution factor for selecting effluent test concentrations.
Effluent test concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
are commonly used, however, test concentrations should be selected
independently for each test based on the objective of the study,
the expected range of toxicity, the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> concentration,
and any available historical testing information on the effluent.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides additional guidance on choosing appropriate
test concentrations.


8.10.3
When these tests are used in determining compliance with
permit limits, effluent test concentrations should be selected to
bracket the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> concentration. This may be achieved by
selecting effluent test concentrations in the following manner: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> effluent, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/4</ENAMEX>. For example, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, appropriate effluent
concentrations may be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX>.


8.10.4
If acute/chronic ratios are to be
determined by simultaneous acute and short-term chronic tests with
a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, using the same sample, both types of tests must
use the same test conditions, i.e., pH, temperature, water
hardness, salinity, etc.


8.11
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RECEIVING WATER</ENAMEX> TESTS




8.11.1
Receiving water toxicity tests generally consist of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and a control. The total hardness of the control
should be comparable to the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


8.11.2
The data from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatments are analyzed by
hypothesis testing to determine if test organism survival in the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> differs significantly from the control. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> per replicate are required for each
treatment (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Summary of Test Conditions and Test</ENAMEX> Acceptability
Criteria in the specific test method).


8.11.3
In cases where the objective of the test is to estimate
the degree of toxicity of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a multiconcentration
test is performed by preparing dilutions of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
using a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 0.5</NUMEX> dilution series, with a suitable control
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CHRONIC TOXICITY TEST</ENAMEX> ENDPOINTS AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX> ENDPOINTS
9.1.1 The objective of chronic aquatic toxicity tests with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effluents</ENAMEX> and pure compounds is to estimate the highest "safe" or
"no-effect concentration" of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. For practical
reasons, the responses observed in these tests are usually limited
to hatchability, gross morphological abnormalities, survival,
growth, and reproduction, and the results of the tests are usually
expressed in terms of the highest toxicant concentration that has
no statistically significant observed effect on these responses,
when compared to the controls. The terms currently used to define
the endpoints employed in the rapid, chronic and sub-chronic
toxicity tests have been derived from the terms previously used for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> life-cycle tests. As shorter chronic tests were developed, it
became common practice to apply the same terminology to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>. The terms used in this manual are as follows:


9.1.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safe Concentration</ENAMEX> - The highest concentration of
toxicant that will permit normal propagation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other
aquatic life in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. The concept of a "safe
concentration" is a biological concept, whereas the
"no-observed-effect concentration" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">below</NUMEX>) is a statistically
defined concentration.


9.1.1.2
No<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-Observed-Effect-Concentration</ENAMEX> (NOEC) - The highest
concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> or partial life-cycle (short-term) test, that causes no
observable adverse effects on the test organisms (i.e., the highest
concentration of toxicant in which the values for the observed
responses are not statistically significantly different from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>). This value is used, along with other factors, to
determine toxicity limits in permits.


9.1.1.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lowest-Observed-Effect-Concentration</ENAMEX> (LOEC) - The lowest
concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> or partial life-cycle (short-term) test, which causes
adverse effects on the test organisms (i.e., where the values for
the observed responses are statistically significantly different
from the controls).


9.1.1.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Effective Concentration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>) - A point estimate of the
toxicant concentration that would cause an observable adverse
affect on a quantal, "all or nothing," response (such as death,
immobilization, or serious incapacitation) in a given percent of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, calculated by point estimation techniques. If the
observable effect is death or immobility, the term, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lethal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concentration</ENAMEX> (LC), should be used (see <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 9.1.1.5</NUMEX>). A
certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> or LC value might be judged from a biological standpoint
to represent a threshold concentration, or lowest concentration
that would cause an adverse effect on the observed
response.


9.1.1.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lethal Concentration</ENAMEX> (LC) - The toxicant concentration
that would cause death in a given percent of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
Identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> when the observed adverse effect is death. For
example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LC50</TIMEX> is the concentration of toxicant that would cause
death in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.


9.1.1.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inhibition Concentration</ENAMEX> (IC) - The toxicant
concentration that would cause a given <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> reduction in a
non-quantal biological measurement for the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For
example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25</TIMEX> is the concentration of toxicant that would cause
a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> reduction in mean young per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> or in growth for the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC50</TIMEX> is the concentration of toxicant that
would cause a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction.

Bonferroni adjustment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, or the Wilcoxon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICs</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECs</ENAMEX> are determined by point estimation techniques (Probit
Analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphical Method</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>). There are
inherent differences between the use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LOEC</ENAMEX> derived from
hypothesis testing to estimate a "safe" concentration, and the use
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC</ENAMEX>, or other point estimates derived from curve
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fitting</ENAMEX>, interpolation, etc.


9.2.2
Most point estimates, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, are
derived from a mathematical model that assumes a continuous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dose-response</ENAMEX> relationship. By definition, any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> value
is an estimate of some amount of adverse effect. Thus the
assessment of a "safe" concentration must be made from a biological
standpoint rather than with a statistical test. In this instance,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> must determine some amount of adverse effect that is
deemed to be "safe", in the sense that from a practical biological
viewpoint it will not affect the normal propagation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and
other aquatic life in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>.


9.2.3
The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOECs</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, assumes
either (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a continuous dose-response relationship, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a
non-continuous (threshold) model of the dose-response
relationship.




9.2.3.1
In the case of a continuous dose-response relationship,
it is also assumed that adverse effects that are not "statistically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observable</ENAMEX>" are also not important from a biological standpoint,
since they are not pronounced enough to test as statistically
significant against some measure of the natural variability of the
responses.


9.2.3.2
In the case of non-continuous dose-response
relationships, it is assumed that there exists a true threshold, or
concentration below which there is no adverse effect on aquatic
life, and above which there is an adverse effect. The purpose of
the statistical analysis in this case is to estimate as closely as
possible where that threshold lies.


9.2.3.3
In either case, it is important to realize that the
amount of adverse effect that is statistically observable (LOEC) or
not observable (NOEC) is highly dependent on all aspects of the
experimental design, such as the number of concentrations of
toxicant, number of replicates per concentration, number of
organisms per replicate, and use of randomization. Other factors
that affect the sensitivity of the test include the choice of
statistical analysis, the choice of an alpha level, and the amount
of variability between responses at a given
concentration.


9.2.3.4
Where the assumption of a continuous dose-response
relationship is made, by definition some amount of adverse effect
might be present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>, but is not great enough to be
detected by hypothesis testing.


9.2.3.5
Where the assumption of a non-continuous dose-response
relationship is made, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> would indeed be an estimate of a
"safe" or "no-effect" concentration if the amount of adverse effect
that appears at the threshold is great enough to test as
statistically significantly different from the controls in the face
of all aspects of the experimental design mentioned above. If,
however, the amount of adverse effect at the threshold were not
great enough to test as statistically different, some amount of
adverse effect might be present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. In any case, the
estimate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> with hypothesis testing is always dependent on
the aspects of the experimental design mentioned above. For this
reason, the reporting and examination of some measure of the
sensitivity of the test (either the minimum significant difference
or the percent change from the control that this minimum difference
represents) is extremely important.


9.2.4
In summary, the assessment of a "safe" or "no-effect"
concentration cannot be made from the results of statistical
analysis alone, unless (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the assumptions of a strict threshold
model are accepted, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) it is assumed that the amount of
adverse effect present at the threshold is statistically detectable
by hypothesis testing. In this case, estimates obtained from a
statistical analysis are indeed estimates of a "no-effect"
concentration. If the assumptions are not deemed tenable, then
estimates from a statistical analysis can only be used in
conjunction with an assessment from a biological standpoint of what
magnitude of adverse effect constitutes a "safe" concentration. In
this instance, a "safe" concentration is not necessarily a truly
"no-effect" concentration, but rather a concentration at which the
effects are judged to be of no biological significance.


9.2.5
A better understanding of the relationship between
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endpoints</ENAMEX> derived by hypothesis testing (NOECs) and point
estimation techniques (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECs</ENAMEX>) would be very helpful in
choosing methods of data analysis. Norberg-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>) reported
that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25s</TIMEX> were comparable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> effluent and
reference toxicant data sets analyzed. The data sets included
short-term chronic toxicity tests for the fathead minnow,
Pimephales promelas, and the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>) reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LC1s</ENAMEX> derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> of data
from short-term embryo-larval tests with reference toxicants were
comparable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1988d</NUMEX>)
reported that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25s</TIMEX> were comparable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> for a set of
daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia, chronic tests with a single reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX>. However, the scope of these comparisons was very limited,
and sufficient information is not yet available to establish an
overall relationship between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of endpoints,
especially when derived from effluent toxicity test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.


9.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRECISION</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.3.1</NUMEX> HYPOTHESIS TESTS


9.3.1.1
When hypothesis tests are used to analyze toxicity test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, it is not possible to express precision in terms of a
commonly used statistic. The results of the test are given in terms
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> endpoints, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No-Observed- Effect Concentration</ENAMEX> (NOEC) and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lowest-Observed-Effect Concentration</ENAMEX> (LOEC). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> and LOEC
are limited to the concentrations selected for the test. The width
of the NOEC-LOEC interval is a function of the dilution series, and
differs greatly depending on whether a dilution factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> is used in the test design. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> recommends the use
of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 0.5</NUMEX> dilution factor (see Section 4, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality Assurance</ENAMEX>). It
is not possible to place confidence limits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> and LOEC
derived from a given test, and it is difficult to quantify the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of the NOEC-LOEC endpoints between tests. If the data
from a series of tests performed with the same toxicant, toxicant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, and test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, were analyzed with hypothesis
tests, precision could only be assessed by a qualitative comparison
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC-LOEC</ENAMEX> intervals, with the understanding that maximum
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> would be attained if all tests yielded the same NOEC-LOEC
interval. In practice, the precision of results of repetitive
chronic tests is considered acceptable if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> vary by no more
than one concentration interval above or below a central tendency.
Using these guidelines, the "normal" range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> from toxicity
tests using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> dilution factor (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold difference between
adjacent concentrations), would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold.


9.3.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES</ENAMEX>


9.3.2.1 Point estimation techniques have the advantage of
providing a point estimate of the toxicant concentration causing a
given amount of adverse (inhibiting) effect, the precision of which
can be quantitatively assessed
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) within tests by calculation of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence limits, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) across tests by calculating a standard deviation and
coefficient of variation.


9.3.2.2
It should be noted that software used to calculate point
estimates occasionally may not provide associated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
intervals. This situation may arise when test data do not meet
specific assumptions required by the statistical methods, when
point estimates are outside of the test concentration range, and
when specific limitations imposed by the software are encountered.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides guidance on confidence intervals under these
circumstances.


9.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATA ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>


9.4.1 ROLE OF THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATISTICIAN</ENAMEX>


9.4.1.1
The use of the statistical methods described in this
manual for routine data analysis does not require the assistance of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX>. However, the interpretation of the results of the
analysis of the data from any of the toxicity tests described in
this manual can become problematic because of the inherent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> and sometimes unavoidable anomalies in biological data.
If the data appear unusual in any way, or fail to meet the
necessary assumptions, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX> should be consulted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX>
who are not proficient in statistics are strongly advised to seek
the assistance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX> before selecting the method of
analysis and using any of the results.


9.4.1.2
The statistical methods recommended in this manual are
not the only possible methods of statistical analysis. Many other
methods have been proposed and considered. Certainly there are
other reasonable and defensible methods of statistical analysis for
this kind of toxicity data. Among alternative hypothesis tests
some, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, require additional assumptions, while
others, like the bootstrap methods, require computerintensive
computations. Alternative point estimation approaches most probably
would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX> to determine the
appropriateness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (goodness of fit), higher order linear
or nonlinear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, confidence intervals for estimates generated
by inverse regression, etc. In addition, point estimation or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regression</ENAMEX> approaches would require the specification by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>
or toxicologists of some low level of adverse effect that would be
deemed acceptable or safe. The statistical methods contained in
this manual have been chosen because they are (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) applicable to
most of the different toxicity test data sets for which they are
recommended, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) powerful statistical tests, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) hopefully "easily"
understood by nonstatisticians, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) amenable to use without a
computer, if necessary.


9.4.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLOTTING THE DATA</ENAMEX>




9.4.2.1
The data should be plotted, both as a preliminary step to
help detect problems and unsuspected trends or patterns in the
responses, and as an aid in interpretation of the results. Further
discussion and plotted sets of data are included in the methods and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices</ENAMEX>.


9.4.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATA TRANSFORMATIONS</ENAMEX>




9.4.3.1
Transformations of the data, (e.g., arc sine square root
and logs), are used where necessary to meet assumptions of the
proposed analyses, such as the requirement for normally distributed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.


9.4.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INDEPENDENCE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANDOMIZATION</ENAMEX>, AND OUTLIERS




9.4.4.1
Statistical independence among observations is a critical
assumption in all statistical analysis of toxicity data. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
best ways to insure independence is to properly follow rigorous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomization</ENAMEX> procedures. Randomization techniques should be
employed at the start of the test, including the randomization of
the placement of test organisms in the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> and
randomization of the test chamber location within the array of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX>. Discussions of statistical independence, outliers and
randomization, and a sample randomization scheme, are included in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix A.</ENAMEX>


9.4.5
REPLICATION AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SENSITIVITY</ENAMEX>




9.4.5.1
The number of replicates employed for each toxicant
concentration is an important factor in determining the sensitivity
of chronic toxicity tests. Test sensitivity generally increases as
the number of replicates is increased, but the point of diminishing
returns in sensitivity may be reached rather quickly. The level of
sensitivity required by a hypothesis test or the confidence
interval for a point estimate will determine the number of
replicates, and should be based on the objectives for obtaining the
toxicity data.


9.4.5.2
In a statistical analysis of toxicity data, the choice of
a particular analysis and the ability to detect departures from the
assumptions of the analysis, such as the normal distribution of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and homogeneity of variance, is also dependent on the number
of replicates. More than the minimum number of replicates may be
required in situations where it is imperative to obtain optimal
statistical results, such as with tests used in enforcement cases
or when it is not possible to repeat the tests. For example, when
the data are analyzed by hypothesis testing, the nonparametric
alternatives cannot be used unless there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX>
replicates at each toxicant concentration.


9.4.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECOMMENDED ALPHA LEVELS</ENAMEX>


9.4.6.1 The data analysis examples included in the manual
specify an alpha level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX> for testing the assumptions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> tests and an alpha level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> for the hypothesis
tests themselves. These levels are common and well accepted levels
for this type of analysis and are presented as a recommended
minimum significance level for toxicity test data analysis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9.5 CHOICE OF ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>


9.5.1
The recommended statistical analysis of most data from
chronic toxicity tests with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">aquatic organisms</ENAMEX> follows a decision
process illustrated in the flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. An initial
decision is made to use point estimation techniques (the Probit
Analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trimmed Spearman</ENAMEX>-Karber
Method, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphical Method</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>)
and/or to use hypothesis testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, the t test with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment). NOTE: For
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES Permit Program</ENAMEX>, the point estimation techniques are the
preferred statistical methods in calculating end points for
effluent toxicity tests. If hypothesis testing is chosen,
subsequent decisions are made on the appropriate procedure for a
given set of data, depending on the results of the tests of
assumptions, as illustrated in the flowchart. A specific flow chart
is included in the analysis section for each test.


9.5.2
Since a single chronic toxicity test might yield
information on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than one parameter</NUMEX> (such as survival, growth,
and reproduction), the lowest estimate of a "no-observed-effect
concentration" for any of the responses would be used as the
"no-observed-effect concentration" for each test. It follows
logically that in the statistical analysis of the data,
concentrations that had a significant toxic effect on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
observed responses would not be subsequently tested for an effect
on some other response. This is one reason for excluding
concentrations that have shown a statistically significant
reduction in survival from a subsequent hypothesis test for effects
on another parameter such as reproduction. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason is that
the exclusion of such concentrations usually results in a more
powerful and appropriate statistical analysis. In performing the
point estimation techniques recommended in this manual, an all-data
approach is used. For example, data from concentrations above the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> for survival are included in determining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICp</ENAMEX> estimates using
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>.


9.5.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION DATA</ENAMEX>




9.5.3.1
Growth data from the fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas,
larval survival and growth test are analyzed using hypothesis
testing or point estimation techniques according to the flowchart
in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The above mentioned growth data may also be analyzed
by generating a point estimate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> Interpolation
Method. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from effluent concentrations that have tested
significantly different from the control for survival are excluded
from further hypothesis tests concerning growth effects. Growth is
defined as the dry weight per original number of test organisms
when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> weights are obtained. When analyzing the data using
point estimation techniques, data from all concentrations are
included in the analysis.


9.5.3.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproduction</ENAMEX> data from the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia,
survival and reproduction test are analyzed using hypothesis
testing or point estimation techniques according to the flowchart
in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. In hypothesis testing, data from effluent
concentrations that have significantly lower survival than the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, as determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exact</ENAMEX> test, are not included in
the hypothesis tests for reproductive effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from all
concentrations are included when using point estimation
techniques.


9.5.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS OF ALGAL GROWTH RESPONSE DATA</ENAMEX>




9.5.4.1
The growth response data from the green alga, Selenastrum
capricornutum, toxicity test, after an appropriate transformation,
if necessary, to meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity
of variance, may be analyzed by hypothesis testing according to the
flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Point estimates, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25 and IC50</TIMEX>,
would also be appropriate in analyzing algal growth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.


9.5.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS OF MORTALITY DATA</ENAMEX>




9.5.5.1
Mortality data are analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>, if
appropriate, or other point estimation techniques (i.e., the
Spearman-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karber Method</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>, or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphical Method</ENAMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I-L</ENAMEX> and the discussion below).
The mortality data can also be analyzed by hypothesis testing,
after an arc sine square root transformation (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-F</ENAMEX>),
according to the flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.


9.5.5.2
Mortality data from the daphnid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceriodaphnia</ENAMEX> dubia,
survival and reproduction test are analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exact Test</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix G</ENAMEX>) prior to the analysis of the reproduction data. The
mortality data may also be analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>, if
appropriate or other methods (see <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 9.5.5.1</NUMEX>).


9.6
HYPOTHESIS TESTS



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.6.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DUNNETT</ENAMEX>'S PROCEDURE


9.6.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure is used to determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. The
procedure consists of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine
the error term, which is then used in a multiple comparison
procedure for comparing each of the treatment means with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> mean, in a series of paired tests (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>). Use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> replicates per
treatment to check the assumptions of the test. In cases where the
numbers of data points (replicates) for each concentration are not
equal, a t test may be performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment for
multiple comparisons (see <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Appendix D</ENAMEX>), instead of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s
Procedure.


9.6.1.2
The assumptions upon which the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure
is contingent are that the observations within treatments are
normally distributed, with homogeneity of variance. Before
analyzing the data, these assumptions must be tested using the
procedures provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix B.</ENAMEX>


9.6.1.3
If, after suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">transformations</ENAMEX> have been carried out,
the normality assumptions have not been met, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX>
Test should be used if there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more data points
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">replicates</NUMEX>) per toxicant concentration. If the numbers of data
points for each toxicant concentration are not equal, the Wilcoxon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment should be used (see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>).


9.6.1.4
Some indication of the sensitivity of the analysis should
be provided by calculating (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the minimum difference between means
that can be detected as statistically significant, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
percent change from the control mean that this minimum difference
represents for a given test.


9.6.1.5
A step-by-step example of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure
is provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix C.</ENAMEX>


9.6.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T TEST WITH</ENAMEX> THE BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT




9.6.2.1
A t test with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment is used as an
alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure when the number of replicates is
not the same for all concentrations. This test sets an upper bound
of alpha on the overall error rate, in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s
Procedure, for which the overall error rate is fixed at alpha. Thus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure is a more powerful test.


9.6.2.2
The assumptions upon which the use of the t test with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment is contingent are that the observations
within treatments are normally distributed, with homogeneity of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>. These assumptions must be tested using the procedures
provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix B.</ENAMEX>


9.6.2.3
The estimate of the safe concentration derived from this
test is reported in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. A step-by-step example of
the use of the t test with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment is provided in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix D.</ENAMEX>


9.6.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEEL</ENAMEX>'S MANY-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ONE RANK TEST</ENAMEX>




9.6.3.1
Steel's Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX> is a multiple comparison
procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. This
method is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure, except that it is not
necessary to meet the assumption of normality. The data are ranked,
and the analysis is performed on the ranks rather than on the data
themselves. If the data are normally or nearly normally
distributed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure would be more sensitive (would
detect smaller differences between the treatments and control). For
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that are not normally distributed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank Test</ENAMEX>
can be much more efficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehmann</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>).


9.6.3.2
It is necessary to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> replicates per
toxicant concentration to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s test. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s
procedure, the sensitivity of this test cannot be stated in terms
of the minimum difference between treatment means and the control
mean that can be detected as statistically significant.


9.6.3.3
The estimate of the safe concentration is reported as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. A step-by-step example of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX>
Test is provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix E.</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WILCOXON</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RANK SUM TEST WITH</ENAMEX> THE BONFERRONI
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADJUSTMENT</ENAMEX>




9.6.4.1
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni Adjustment</ENAMEX>
is a nonparametric test for comparing treatments with a control.
The data are ranked and the analysis proceeds exactly as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s
Test except that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment for multiple comparisons
is used instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s tables. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s test can be used
(i.e., when there are equal numbers of data points per toxicant
concentration), it will be more powerful (able to detect smaller
differences as statistically significant) than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon Rank</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sum Test</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment.


9.6.4.2
The estimate of the safe concentration is reported as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. A step-by-step example of the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon Rank Sum</ENAMEX>
Test with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni Adjustment</ENAMEX> is provided in Appendix
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>


9.6.5
A CAUTION IN THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS TESTING




9.6.5.1
If in the calculation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> by
hypothesis testing, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tested concentrations cause statistically
significant adverse effects, but an intermediate concentration did
not cause statistically significant effects, the results should be
used with extreme caution.


9.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROBIT ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>


9.7.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> is used to estimate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LC1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC1</TIMEX>,
or EC50 and the associated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval. The analysis
consists of adjusting the data for mortality in the control, and
then using a maximum likelihood technique to estimate the
parameters of the underlying log tolerance distribution, which is
assumed to have a particular shape.


9.7.1.2
The assumption upon which the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> is
contingent is a normal distribution of log tolerances. If the
normality assumption is not met, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> partial
mortalities are not obtained, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> should not be used.
It is important to check the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> to
determine if use of the analysis is appropriate. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>
test for heterogeneity provides one good test of appropriateness of
the analysis. The computer program (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix</ENAMEX> I) checks the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chi-square</ENAMEX> statistic calculated for the data set against the
tabular value, and provides an error message if the calculated
value exceeds the tabular value.


9.7.1.3
A discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>, and examples of computer
program input and output, are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix I.</ENAMEX>


9.7.1.4
In cases where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> is not appropriate, the
LC50 and associated confidence interval may be estimated by the
Spearman-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karber Method</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Appendix J</ENAMEX>) or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trimmed Spearman</ENAMEX>-Karber
Method (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix K</ENAMEX>). If the test results in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> survival and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
mortality in adjacent treatments (all or nothing effect), the LC50
may be estimated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphical Method</ENAMEX> (Appendix

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>).


9.7.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINEAR INTERPOLATION METHOD</ENAMEX>




9.7.2.1
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix M</ENAMEX>) is a
procedure to calculate a point estimate of the effluent or other
toxicant concentration [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inhibition Concentration</ENAMEX>, (IC)] that causes
a given <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> reduction (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, etc.) in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> or growth of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The procedure was
designed for general applicability in the analysis of data from
short-term chronic toxicity tests.


9.7.2.2
Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX> is based on the
assumptions that the responses (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) are monotonically non-increasing
(the mean response for each higher concentration is less than or
equal to the mean response for the previous concentration), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
follow a piecewise linear response function, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) are from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX>, independent, and representative sample of test data. The
assumption for piecewise linear response cannot be tested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistically</ENAMEX>, and no defined statistical procedure is provided to
test the assumption for monotonicity. Where the observed means are
not strictly monotonic by examination, they are adjusted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smoothing</ENAMEX>. In cases where the responses at the low toxicant
concentrations are much higher than in the controls, the smoothing
process may result in a large upward adjustment in the control
mean.


9.7.2.3
The inability to test the monotonicity and piecewise
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> response assumptions for this method makes it difficult to
assess when the method is, or is not, producing reliable results.
Therefore, the method should be used with caution when the results
of a toxicity test approach an "all or nothing" response from one
concentration to the next in the concentration series, and when it
appears that there is a large deviation from monotonicity. See
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix M</ENAMEX> for a more detailed discussion of the use of this method
and a computer program available for performing
calculations.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10.2 TEST</ENAMEX> REVIEW



10.2.1
Test review is an important part of an overall quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance program</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 4</ENAMEX>) and is necessary for ensuring that
all test results are reported accurately. Test review should be
conducted on each test by both the testing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and the
regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>.


10.2.2
SAMPLING AND HANDLING




10.2.2.1
The collection and handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are reviewed to
verify that the sampling and handling procedures given in Section 8
were followed. Chain-of-custody forms are reviewed to verify that
samples were tested within allowable sample holding times
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 8.5.4</NUMEX>). Any deviations from the procedures given in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 8</ENAMEX> should be documented and described in the data report
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 10.1</NUMEX>).


10.2.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ACCEPTABILITY CRITERIA</ENAMEX>




10.2.3.1
Test data are reviewed to verify that test acceptability
criteria (TAC) requirements for a valid test have been met. Any
test not meeting the minimum test acceptability criteria is
considered invalid. All invalid tests must be repeated with a newly
collected sample.


10.2.4
TEST CONDITIONS




10.2.4.1
Test conditions are reviewed and compared to the
specifications listed in the summary of test condition tables
provided for each method. Physical and chemical measurements taken
during the test (e.g., temperature, pH, and DO) also are reviewed
and compared to specified ranges. Any deviations from
specifications should be documented and described in the data
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 10.1</NUMEX>).


10.2.4.2
The summary of test condition tables presented for each
method identify test conditions as required or recommended. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WET</ENAMEX>
test data submitted under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NPDES</ENAMEX> permits, all required test
conditions must be met or the test is considered invalid and must
be repeated with a newly collected sample. Deviations from
recommended test conditions must be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis to determine the validity of test results. Deviations from
recommended test conditions may or may not invalidate a test result
depending on the degree of the departure and the objective of the
test. The reviewer should consider the degree of the deviation and
the potential or observed impact of the deviation on the test
result before rejecting or accepting a test result as valid. For
example, if dissolved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> is measured below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>, the reviewer should consider whether any observed
mortality in that test chamber corresponded with the drop in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dissolved oxygen</ENAMEX>.


10.2.4.3
Whereas slight deviations in test conditions may not
invalidate an individual test result, test condition deviations
that continue to occur frequently in a given laboratory may
indicate the need for improved quality control in that
laboratory.


10.2.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATISTICAL METHODS</ENAMEX>


10.2.5.1 The statistical methods used for analyzing test data
are reviewed to verify that the recommended flowcharts for
statistical analysis were followed. Any deviation from the
recommended flowcharts for selection of statistical methods should
be noted in the data report. Statistical methods other than those
recommended in the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">flowcharts</ENAMEX> may be appropriate (see
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 9.4.1.2</NUMEX>), however, the laboratory must document the use
of and provide the rationale for the use of any alternate
statistical method. In all cases (flowchart recommended methods or
alternate methods), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> should verify that the necessary
assumptions are met for the statistical method used.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10.2.6 CONCENTRATION-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS</ENAMEX>


10.2.6.1
The concept of a concentration-response, or more
classically, a dose-response relationship is "the most fundamental
and pervasive one in toxicology" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casarett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doull</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>). This
concept assumes that there is a causal relationship between the
dose of a toxicant (or concentration for toxicants in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>) and
a measured response. A response may be any measurable biochemical
or biological parameter that is correlated with exposure to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX>. The classical concentration-response relationship is
depicted as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sigmoidal</ENAMEX> shaped curve, however, the particular shape
of the concentration-response curve may differ for each coupled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX> and response pair. In general, more severe responses (such
as acute effects) occur at higher concentrations of the toxicant,
and less severe responses (such as chronic effects) occur at lower
concentrations. A single toxicant also may produce multiple
responses, each characterized by a concentration-response
relationship. A corollary of the concentration-response concept is
that every toxicant should exhibit a concentration-response
relationship, given that the appropriate response is measured and
given that the concentration range evaluated is appropriate. Use of
this concept can be helpful in determining whether an effluent
possesses toxicity and in identifying anomalous test
results.


10.2.6.2
The concentration-response relationship generated for
each multi-concentration test must be reviewed to ensure that
calculated test results are interpreted appropriately. USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides guidance on evaluating concentration-response
relationships to assist in determining the validity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WET</ENAMEX> test
results. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WET</ENAMEX> test results (from multi-concentration tests)
reported under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> should be reviewed and reported
according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> guidance on the evaluation of
concentration-response relationships (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000a</TIMEX>). This guidance
provides review steps for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different concentration-response
patterns that may be encountered in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">WET</ENAMEX> test data. Based on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, the guidance provides one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> determinations: that
calculated effect concentrations are reliable and should be
reported, that calculated effect concentrations are anomalous and
should be explained, or that the test was inconclusive and the test
should be repeated with a newly collected sample. It should be
noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of a valid concentration-response
relationship is not always clear cut. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from some tests may
suggest consultation with professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toxicologists</ENAMEX> and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulatory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. Tests that exhibit unexpected
concentration-response relationships also may indicate a need for
further investigation and possible retesting.


10.2.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REFERENCE TOXICANT TESTING</ENAMEX>




10.2.7.1
Test review of a given effluent or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> test
should include review of the associated reference toxicant test and
current control chart. Reference toxicant testing and control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">charting</ENAMEX> is required for documenting the quality of test organisms
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.7</NUMEX>) and ongoing laboratory performance (Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.16</NUMEX>). The reviewer should verify that a quality control reference
toxicant test was conducted according to the specified frequency
required by the permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> or recommended by the method
(e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>). The test acceptability criteria, test conditions,
concentration-response relationship, and test sensitivity of the
reference toxicant test are reviewed to verify that the reference
toxicant test conducted was a valid test. The results of the
reference toxicant test are then plotted on a control chart (see
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.16</NUMEX>) and compared to the current control chart limits
(Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> standard deviations).


10.2.7.2
Reference toxicant tests that fall outside of recommended
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> chart limits are evaluated to determine the validity of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> effluent and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> tests (see Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.16</NUMEX>). An out of control reference toxicant test result does not
necessarily invalidate associated test results. The reviewer should
consider the degree to which the reference toxicant test result
fell outside of control chart limits, the width of the limits, the
direction of the deviation (toward increasing test organism
sensitivity or toward decreasing test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism sensitivity</ENAMEX>), the
test conditions of both the effluent test and the reference
toxicant test, and the objective of the test. More frequent and/or
concurrent reference toxicant testing may be advantageous if recent
problems (e.g., invalid tests, reference toxicant test results
outside of control chart limits, reduced health of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, or increased within-test variability) have been
identified in testing.


10.2.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST</ENAMEX> VARIABILITY




10.2.8.1
The within-test variability of individual tests should be
reviewed. Excessive within-test variability may invalidate a test
result and warrant retesting. For evaluating within-test
variability, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> should consult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> guidance on upper and
lower percent minimum significant difference (PMSD) bounds (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2000b).


10.2.8.2
When <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">NPDES</ENAMEX> permits require sublethal hypothesis testing
endpoints from Methods <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000.0,1002.0</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1003.0</NUMEX> (e.g., growth or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction NOECs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOECs</ENAMEX>), within-test variability must be
reviewed and variability criteria must be applied as described in
this section (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.2.8.2</NUMEX>). When the methods are used for
non-regulatory purposes, the variability criteria herein are
recommended but are not required, and their use (or the use of
alternative variability criteria) may depend upon the intended uses
of the test results and the requirements of any applicable data
quality objectives and quality assurance plan.




10.2.8.2.1
To measure test variability, calculate the percent
minimum significant difference (PMSD) achieved in the test. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> is the smallest percentage decrease in growth or reproduction
from the control that could be determined as statistically
significant in the test. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> is calculated as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times the
minimum significant difference (MSD) divided by the control mean.
The equation and examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSD</ENAMEX> calculations are shown in Appendix
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. PMSD</ENAMEX> may be calculated legitimately as a descriptive statistic
for within-test variability, even when the hypothesis test is
conducted using a non-parametric method. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds were based
on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of tests, including tests for which a
non-parametric method was required for determining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOEC</ENAMEX>. The conduct of hypothesis testing to determine test results
should follow the statistical flow charts provided for each method.
That is, when test data fail to meet assumptions of normality or
heterogeneity of variance, a nonparametric method (determined
following the statistical flowchart for the method) should be used
to calculate test results, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> may be calculated as
described above (using parametric methods) to provide a measure of
test variability.


10.2.8.2.2
Compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured in the test with the upper PMSD
bound variability criterion listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. When the test PMSD
exceeds the upper bound, the variability among replicates is
unusually large for the test method. Such a test should be
considered insufficiently sensitive to detect toxic effects on
growth or reproduction of substantial magnitude. A finding of
toxicity at a particular concentration may be regarded as
trustworthy, but a finding of "no toxicity" or "no statistically
significant toxicity" at a particular concentration should not be
regarded as a reliable indication that there is no substantial
toxic effect on growth or reproduction at that
concentration.


10.2.8.2.3
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured for the test is less than or equal
to the upper PMSD bound variability criterion in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, then the
test's variability measure lies within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal</TIMEX> bounds and the effect
concentration estimate (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or LOEC) would normally be
accepted unless other test review steps raise serious doubts about
its validity.


10.2.8.2.4
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSD
bound variability criterion in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, then one of the following
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases applies (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.2.8.2.4.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.2.8.2.4.2</NUMEX>).




10.2.8.2.4.1
If toxicity is found at the permitted receiving water
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (RWC) based upon the value of the effect
concentration estimate (NOEC or LOEC), then the test shall be
accepted and the effect concentration estimate may be reported,
unless other test review steps raise serious doubts about its
validity.


10.2.8.2.4.2
If toxicity is not found at the permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> based upon
the value of the effect concentration estimate (NOEC or LOEC) and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSD bound, then
the test shall not be accepted, and a new test must be conducted
promptly on a newly collected sample.


10.2.8.2.5
To avoid penalizing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> that achieve unusually
high precision, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds shall also be applied when a
hypothesis test result (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or LOEC) is reported. Lower PMSD
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bounds</ENAMEX>, which are based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th</TIMEX> percentiles of national PMSD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10th</NUMEX> percentile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> represents
a practical limit to the sensitivity of the test method because few
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> are able to achieve such precision on a


regular basis and most do not achieve it even occasionally. In
determining hypothesis test results (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or LOEC), a test
concentration shall not be considered toxic (i.e., significantly
different from the control) if the relative difference from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> is less than the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2000b for specific examples of implementing lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds.
10.2.8.3 To assist in reviewing within-test variability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
recommends maintaining control charts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSDs</ENAMEX> calculated for
successive effluent tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). A control chart of PMSD
values characterizes the range of variability observed within a
given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and allows comparison of individual test PMSDs
with the laboratory's typical range of variability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> charts
of other variability and test performance measures, such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSD</ENAMEX>, standard deviation or CV of control responses, or average
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> response, also may be useful for reviewing tests and
minimizing variability. The log of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> will provide an
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> normal variate useful for control charting.
